King Jaipal then sent a new message to the Sultan and his Amir, stating \"You have seen the impetuosity of the Hindus and their indifference to death. If you insist on war in the hope of obtaining plunder, tribute, elephants and slaves, then you leave us no alternative but to destroy our property, take the eyes out of our elephants, cast our families in fire, and commit mass suicide, so that all that will be left to you to conquer and seize is stones and dirt, dead bodies, and scattered bones.\"<ref name= Sabuktigin >Al-Utbi, [[Tarikh Yamini]], For English translation, see: Elliot and Dowson, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians - The Muhammadan Period, Vol 2, Trubner London, pp. 18\u201324</ref> Amir Sabuktigin then promised peace in exchange for a large ransom.

Originally divisional rivals in the [[AFC Central]], the Ravens and Titans developed strong enmity between each other before the two teams were moved to separate divisions. The teams have met in the playoffs four times and are both known for their strong defensive play.\n\n==History== \nThe rivalry between the Ravens and the then-Houston Oilers began with the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]] when the Baltimore Ravens were founded. The Ravens are officially considered an expansion team that was placed in the AFC Central division, which included the Oilers, along with their existing rival teams in [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]] (deactivated from 1996 to 1998 as a result of the original team [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|moving to Baltimore to form the Ravens]]), [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]], in addition to the recently-formed [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. The Ravens were a replacement franchise for the Baltimore area about thirteen years after the area\u2019s original franchise, [[History of the Baltimore Colts|the Colts]], [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] prior to the 1984 season.\n\nThe Oilers were originally a franchise in the [[American Football League]] from 1960 to 1969. They became an NFL franchise as part of the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. When the rivalry with the Ravens started, the Oilers were in their final year based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]; they would move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], in [[1997 NFL season|1997]] after a 26-year stint as a Houston-based franchise (although in their first season based in Tennessee, they played in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]), and to eventually become the [[Tennessee Titans]] in [[1999 NFL Season|1999]].\n\nAs divisional rivals in the AFC Central division, the two teams had twelve regular-season meetings (plus one postseason meeting) in the years between the Ravens\u2019 1996 debut and the conference realignments of 2002. When the [[Houston Texans]] were established in 2002 for the NFL to become a 32-team league, the Central divisions of both the AFC and [[National Football Conference|NFC]] were split into two [[AFC North|northern]] and [[AFC South|southern]] divisions. In the process, the Ravens, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and the [[Cleveland Browns]] were placed in the AFC North, while the Titans were placed in the AFC South along with the Texans, Jaguars, and, former [[AFC East]] member [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]].\n\nAfter the formation of the NFL's northern and southern divisions, the Ravens\u2013Titans rivalry is only renewed every three years; the last year where consecutive meetings regularly occurred was in the 2001 season.<ref>Calderon, Shaun (January 8, 2020).

Originally divisional rivals in the [[AFC Central]], the Ravens and Titans developed strong enmity between each other before the two teams were moved to separate divisions. The teams have met in the playoffs four times and are both known for their strong defensive play.\n\n==History== \nThe rivalry between the Ravens and the then-Houston Oilers began with the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]] when the Baltimore Ravens were founded. The Ravens were officially an expansion team that was placed in the AFC Central division, which included the Oilers, along with their existing rival teams in [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]] (deactivated from 1996 to 1998 as a result of the original team [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|moving to Baltimore to form the Ravens]]), [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]]. The Ravens were a replacement franchise for the Baltimore area about thirteen years after the area\u2019s original franchise, [[History of the Baltimore Colts|the Colts]], [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] prior to the 1984 season.\n\nThe Oilers were originally a franchise in the [[American Football League]] from 1960 to 1969. They became an NFL franchise as part of the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. When the rivalry with the Ravens started, the Oilers were in their final year based in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]; they would move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], in [[1997 NFL season|1997]] after a 26-year stint as a Houston-based franchise (although in their first season based in Tennessee, they played in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]), and to eventually become the [[Tennessee Titans]] in [[1999 NFL Season|1999]].\n\nAs divisional rivals in the AFC Central division, the two teams had twelve regular-season meetings (plus one postseason meeting) in the years between the Ravens\u2019 1996 debut and the conference realignments of 2002. When the [[Houston Texans]] were established in 2002 for the NFL to become a 32-team league, the Central divisions of both the AFC and [[National Football Conference|NFC]] were split into two [[AFC North|northern]] and [[AFC South|southern]] divisions. In the process, the Ravens, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and the [[Cleveland Browns]] were placed in the AFC North, while the Titans were placed in the AFC South along with the Texans, [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jaguars]], and, former [[AFC East]] member [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]].\n\nAfter the formation of the NFL's northern and southern divisions, the Ravens\u2013Titans rivalry is only renewed every three years; the last year where consecutive meetings regularly occurred was in the 2001 season.<ref>Calderon, Shaun (January 8, 2020).
