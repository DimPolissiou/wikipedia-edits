Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

At the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], Denman had a population of 1,789.<ref name=Census2016/>\n\n==Description==\nDenman is situated on the Hunter River near the [[Wollemi National Park]]. The main rural industries in the region are wine grape growing, horse breeding and farming. The town holds the annual Food and Wine Affair festival on the first Saturday of May.\n\nDenman is also near Mount Rombo, a hill that has an unusual geometric shape causing to look like it has a perfectly flat top if it is viewed from Mangoola Road, a road that branches off the Golden Highway\n\nAbout {{convert|20|km}} north-west of Denman, in the [[Goulburn River National Park]], is [[Mount Dangar]], with an elevation of {{convert|670|m}} {{AHD}}.

It is classified as a separate letter in several extended [[Latin alphabet]]s (including [[Azeri alphabet|Azeri]], [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]], [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]]), but as the letter '''[[U]]'''  with an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]]/[[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in others such as [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Galician alphabet|Galician]], [[German alphabet|German]], [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]] and [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]]. Although not a part of their alphabet, it also appears in languages such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] when retained in foreign names and words,{{Example needed |date=November 2019}} and Finnish and Swedish spells said letter and sound in domestic words solely as [[Y]]. A small number of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words also use this as a diaeresis.\n\n== U-umlaut ==\nA glyph, '''U''' with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]], appears in the [[German alphabet]]. It represents the umlauted form of ''u'', which results in the same sound as the {{IPA|[y]}}. It can also represent [[Near-close near-front rounded vowel|[\u028f]]]. The letter is [[collation|collated]] together with ''U'', or as ''UE''. In languages that have adopted German names or spellings, such as [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]], the letter also occurs. It is however not a part of these languages' alphabets. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the letter is called ''tyskt y'' which means ''German y''.\n\nIn other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet or in limited [[character set]]s such as [[ASCII]], U-umlaut is frequently replaced with the two-letter combination \"'''ue'''\". Software for [[optical character recognition]] sometimes sees it falsely as ''ii''.\n\n== Letter \u00dc ==\n\nThe letter '''\u00dc''' is present in the [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], [[Uyghur Latin alphabet|Uyghur Latin]], [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]], [[Azeri alphabet|Azeri]], [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]], [[Crimean Tatar alphabet|Crimean Tatar]], [[Kazakh alphabet|Kazakh Latin]] and [[Tatar alphabet|Tatar Latin]] [[alphabet]]s, where it represents a [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[y]}}. It is considered a distinct letter, [[Collation|collated]] separately, not a simple modification of U or Y, and is distinct from ''UE''.\n\nIn the [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] and [[Finnish alphabet]]s ''\u00fc'' is alphabetized as ''y''.\n\nThis same letter appears in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Romanisation]]s [[pinyin]], [[Wade-Giles]], and the German-based [[Lessing-Othmer]], where it represents the same sound {{IPA|[y]}}: \u7da0/l\u00fc (green) or \u5973/n\u00fc (female). Standard [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation has both the sounds {{IPA|[y]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}. Pinyin only uses \"\u00dc\" to represent {{IPA|[y]}} after the letters \"L\" or \"N\" to avoid confusion with words such as \u8def/lu (road) and \u6012/nu (anger). Words such as \u7389/yu (jade) or \u53e5/ju (sentence) are pronounced with {{IPA|[y]}}, but are not spelled with \"\u00dc\". Although Wade-Giles and Lessing use ''\u00dc'' in all situations. As the letter \"\u00dc\" is missing on most keyboards and the letter \"V\" is not present in standard Mandarin pinyin, the letter \"V\" is used on most computer Chinese input methods to enter the letter \"\u00dc\". As a result, romanisation of Chinese with the letter \"V\" representing the \u00dc sound is sometimes found. However, \u00dc sound should be officially represented by \"yu\" in Pinyin when it's difficult to enter \u00dc. For example, the surname L\u00fc (\u5415) would be written as \"Lyu\" in the passports.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqzx/2012-10/11/content_15809608.htm \u65b0\u7248\u62a4\u7167\u201c\u5415\u201d\u59d3\u6539\u62fc\u201cLYU\u201d \u82f1\u6587\u65e0\u00fc\u88ab\u66ff\u4ee3]. Beijing Daily. 2012-10-11.</ref>\n\n== U-diaeresis ==\n\nSeveral languages use [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over the letter '''U''' to show that the letter is pronounced in its regular way, without dropping out, building [[diphthong]]s with neighbours, etc.\n\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is used to distinguish between \"gue\"/\"g\u00fce\" {{IPA|[\u0261e]}}/{{IPA|[\u0261we]}} and \"gui\"/\"g\u00fci\" {{IPA|[\u0261i]}}/{{IPA|[\u0261wi]}}: ''nicarag\u00fcense'' (\"Nicaraguan\"), ''ping\u00fcino'' (\"penguin\").\n\nSimilarly in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], \"gue~g\u00fce\" are {{IPA|[\u0261e]}}~{{IPA|[\u0261we]}}, \"gui~g\u00fci\" are {{IPA|[\u0261i]}}~{{IPA|[\u0261wi]}}, \"que~q\u00fce\" are {{IPA|[ke]}}~{{IPA|[kwe]}} and \"qui~q\u00fci\" are {{IPA|[ki]}}~{{IPA|[kwi]}}, \nas in ''aig\u00fces'', ''ping\u00fcins'', ''q\u00fcesti\u00f3'', ''adeq\u00fci''. Also, ''\u00fc'' is used to mark that vowel pairs that normally would form a diphthong must be pronounced as separate syllables, examples: ''Ra\u00fcl'', ''di\u00fcrn''.\n\nIn French, the diaeresis appears over the \"u\" only very rarely, in some uncommon words, ''capharna\u00fcm'' {{IPA|[-a\u0254m]}} ('shambles'), ''[[Capernaum|Capharna\u00fcm/Caperna\u00fcm]]'' {{IPA|[-a\u0254m]}} or ''[[Emmaus|Emma\u00fcs]]'' {{IPA|[-ays]}}. After the [[French orthography#Accents|1990 spelling reforms]], it is applied to a few more words, like  ''aig'''\u00fc'''e'' (formerly ''aigu'''\u00eb'''''), ''ambig'''\u00fc'''e'' (formerly ''ambigu'''\u00eb''''') and ''arg'''\u00fc'''er'' {{IPA|[a\u0281\u0261\u0265e]}} (formerly without the diaeresis).\n\n== Usage in phonetic alphabets ==\nIn the [[Rheinische Dokumenta]], a phonetic alphabet for many [[West Central German]], the [[Low Rhenish]], and few related [[vernacular]] languages, \"\u00fc\" represents a range from {{IPAblink|y}} to {{IPAblink|\u028f}}.\n\n== Typography ==\nHistorically the unique letter ''\u00dc'' and U-diaeresis were written as a ''U'' with two dots above the letter. U-umlaut was written as a ''U'' with a small ''e'' written above: this minute ''e'' degenerated to two vertical bars in [[medieval]] [[handwriting]]s. In most later handwritings these bars in turn nearly became dots.\n\nIn modern [[typography]] there was insufficient space on [[typewriter]]s and later [[computer keyboard]]s to allow for both a U-with-dots (also representing ''\u00dc'') and a U-with-bars. Since they looked near-identical the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer [[character encoding]]s such as [[ISO 8859-1]]. As a result, there was no way to differentiate between the three different characters. While [[Unicode]] theoretically provides a solution,{{how|date=March 2018}} this is almost never used.\n\n==Computing codes==\n\n{{charmap\n| 00DC | name1 = Latin Capital Letter U with Diaeresis\n| 00FC | name2 = Latin Small Letter U with Diaeresis\n| map1 = [[EBCDIC]] family | map1char1 = FC | map1char2 = DC\n| map2 = [[ISO/IEC 8859|ISO 8859]]-[[ISO/IEC 8859-1|1]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-3|3]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-4|4]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-9|9]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-10|10]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-14|14]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-15|15]]/[[ISO/IEC 8859-16|16]] | map2char1 = DC | map2char2 = FC\n| map3 = [[CP437]] | map3char1 = 9A | map3char2 = 81\n| map4 = [[Code page 10029]] | map4char1 = 86 | map4char2 = 9F\n}}\n\n===Keyboarding===\nThe methods available for entering {{angle bracket|\u00dc}} and {{angle bracket|\u00fc}} from the keyboard depend on the operating system, the keyboard layout, and the application.\n* Microsoft Windows \u2013 some keyboard layouts feature separate keys for {{angle bracket|\u00dc}}\n** Using the Swiss French keyboard, {{angle bracket|\u00fc}} can be entered by typing {{key press|Shift|\u00c8}}\n** Using the US International layout, {{angle bracket|\u00fc}} can be entered by typing {{key press|AltGR|Y}}\n* Microsoft Windows: with the Number Lock on, hold down the Alt key while typing on the numeric keypad the decimal value of the code point from the active DOS/OEM code page ''without'' a leading zero, then release the {{key press|Alt}} key; i.e. {{key press|Alt|1|5|4}} for {{angle bracket|\u00dc}} and {{key press|Alt|1|2|9}} for {{angle bracket|\u00fc}}\n* Microsoft Windows: with the Number Lock on, hold down the {{key press|Alt}} key while typing on the numeric keypad the decimal value of the code point from the active ANSI code page ''with'' a leading zero, then release the Alt key; i.e. {{key press|Alt|0|2|2|0}} for {{angle bracket|\u00dc}} and {{key press|Alt|0|2|5|2}} for {{angle bracket|\u00fc}}\n* Microsoft Word for Windows: type {{key press|Ctrl|:}} followed by {{key press|Shift|U}} for {{angle bracket|\u00dc}} or {{key press|Ctrl|:}} then {{key press|U}} for {{angle bracket|\u00fc}}\n* [[macOS]] with an English keyboard layout (Australian, British, or U.S.): type {{key press|Option|U}} followed by {{key press|Shift|U}} for {{angle bracket|\u00dc}} or {{key press|Option|U}} and then {{key press|U}} for {{angle bracket|\u00fc}} or by keeping the {{key press|U}} key pressed and then typing {{key press|2}}\n* In GTK-based GUI-Applications, {{key press|Ctrl|Shift|U}} followed by the Hex-Code \n\n==See also==\n* [[Umlaut (diacritic)]]\n*\u04f0 \u04f1 : [[U with diaeresis (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter U with diaeresis]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{Latin script}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:U-Umlaut}}\n[[Category:Latin letters with diacritics]]\n[[Category:Uncommon Latin letters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|U-umlaut|the sound change in the Germanic languages|U-mutation (disambiguation){{!}}U-mutation|the region in Tibet|\u00dc (region)}}\n{{one source|date=October 2018}}\n{| align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; padding: 10px; font-size: 36pt; line-height: 36pt; text-align: center;\"\n| \u00dc\n| \u00fc\n|}\n'''\u00dc''' (lowercase '''\u00fc'''), is a character that typically represents a [[close front rounded vowel]]  {{IPA|[y]}}.

Other settings like image contrast and color-blind friendly settings are also available.\nWhile the majority of menus are narrated, some menus deep in franchise, for example, are not narrated. An example of this is when you are scouting college players, or are trying to purchase free agents or when you are attempting to complete the training.

The mode acts as an updated version of the \"Superstar Mode\", where the player would take their custom player and control them throughout a career, which was featured from ''[[Madden NFL 06]]'' until its removal in ''[[Madden NFL 25]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/25/18516480/madden-nfl-20-cover-release-date-ea-sports-ncaa-football|title=Madden NFL 20 brings back NCAA Football teams for new career mode|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2019-04-25|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[EA Sports]] introduced another mode called Superstar KO, as part of the game's first \"season\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-20/news/superstar-ko-deep-dive|title=Superstar KO: Developer Deep Dive|last=Arts|first=Electronic|date=2019-09-03|website=Electronic Arts Inc.|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Madden 20 {{!}} Official Superstar KO Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdA55HHL-CE|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> In each round, each team plays a drive from their own 25-yard line to score a touchdown and a two-point conversion. If teams draw, the round is decided over a \"tug-of-war\", where each team does three plays, and the team that advances furthest wins the round. After each round, the winner can draft a player from the rival's team.\n\nEA continued with including accessibility features for blind and visually impaired end users. Not least among these is menu narration, in which options are spoken aloud as the player navigates to them using synthesized speech. As part of his voice role for the game, Brandon advises via the game intro concerning accessibility settings and how to reach them. Other settings like image contrast and color-blind friendly settings are also available.\nWhile the majority of menus are narrated, some menus deep in franchise, for example, are not narrated. An example of this is when you are scouting college players, or are trying to purchase free agents or when you are attempting to complete the training. These are some of the gaps in coverage.\n\nMadden 20 brought back game modes from the previous [[Madden 19 | Madden]], such as Franchise mode and Ultimate Team.\n\n==Release==\nThe game was released on August 2, 2019. It was able to be accessed three days prior on July 30 by those players who purchased the \"Superstar\" or \"Ultimate Superstar\" editions of the game, which included [[Loot box|packs]] and special abilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Madden 20 release date and cover star confirmed \u2013 here\u2019s everything you need to know |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/madden-20-release-date-and-cover-star-confirmed-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/ |website=GamesRadar.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=COMPLETE GUIDE TO MADDEN NFL 20'S PREORDER BONUSES|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/21/madden-nfl-20-release-date-special-edition |website=ign.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (XONE) 79/100<ref name=\"MetaXbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/madden-nfl-20 |title=Madden NFL 20 for Xbox One Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><br>(PS4) 76/100<ref name=\"MetaPS4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/madden-nfl-20 |title=Madden NFL 20 for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref><br>(PC) 72/100<ref name=\"MetaPC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/madden-nfl-20 |title=Madden NFL 20 for PC Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=GI>{{cite magazine|last=Kato|first=Matthew|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/madden-nfl-20/coming-up-short|title=Madden NFL 20: Coming Up Short|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| GameRev = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=GameRev>{{cite web|last=Treese|first=Tyler|url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/573147-madden-nfl-20-review-ps4-xbox-one|title=Madden NFL 20 Review - Back to the same ol\u2019 glitchiron|website=[[Game Revolution]]|date=July 28, 2019|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=GSpot>{{cite web|last=Makuch|first=Eddie \n|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-20-review-some-stumbles-no-fumbles/1900-6417263/|title=Madden NFL 20 Review - Some Stumbles, No Fumbles|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=July 31, 2019|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| GRadar = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=GRadar>{{cite web|last=Delaney|first=Mark|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/madden-20-review/|title=Madden 20 Review: \u201cLike Drafting a Left Tackle With the First Overall Pick\u201d|website=[[GamesRadar+]]|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.1/10<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|last=Kollars|first=Robert|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/30/madden-nfl-20-review|title=Madden NFL 20 Review|website=[[IGN]]|date=July 30, 2019|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref>\n| SN = 4/10<ref name=SN>{{cite web|last=Jarrad|first=Chris|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/113117/madden-nfl-20-review-no-love-for-the-game|title=Madden NFL 20 review: No love for the game|website=[[Shacknews]]|date=July 30, 2019|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\nAccording to [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], ''Madden NFL 20'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics for the console versions and \"mixed or average\" reviews for the PC.<ref name=\"MetaPS4\"/><ref name=\"MetaPC\"/><ref name=\"MetaXbox\"/> \n\n''[[IGN]]'' gave the game an 8.1/10 and wrote: \"''Madden NFL 20''{{'}}s new superstar players and control refinements make its moment-to-moment gameplay the best the series has seen this console generation, but areas like Franchise have been left behind.\"<ref name=IGN/> In its 8/10 review, ''[[GameSpot]]'' wrote that \"''Madden NFL 20'' is an improved version of the annualized professional football series that excels in some areas and leaves something to be desired in others.\"<ref name=GSpot/>\n\n''[[GamesRadar+]]'' praised the updated story mode in comparison to Longshot and the addition of the X-factor players, saying that the game \"clears the roster and properly initiates the rebuilding phase for football's first franchise,\" although noted Franchise mode again felt neglected.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> ''[[Game Revolution]]'', which gave ''Madden NFL 20'' a 3/5, also praised the X-factor addition, saying stars felt \"bigger than ever\", but was equally disappointed with the lacking in Franchise mode.<ref name=GameRev/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game a 7.5/10, summarizing its review with: \"New features can only do so much for a series that needs work in multiple areas.\"<ref name=GI/>\n\nIn a scathing review, ''[[Shacknews]]'' gave the game a 4/10, calling it \"the worst major sports league video game out there,\" criticizing EA for only making marginal improvements to previous installments.<ref name=SN/>\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the [[Northern Yuan dynasty|surviving Yuan Mongols]] from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu Fortress]], less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai era]]. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the [[Great Wall of China]]. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen.\n\nHowever, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades.

Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the [[Northern Yuan dynasty|surviving Yuan Mongols]] from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu Fortress]], less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai era]]. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the [[Great Wall of China]]. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen.\n\nHowever, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], this is the [[December solstice]] (usually 21 or 22 December) and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], this is the [[June solstice]] (usually 20 or 21 June). Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment, the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs. Other names are \"midwinter\", the \"extreme of winter\" ([[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]), or the \"shortest day\". Traditionally, in many [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter, but today in some countries and calendars, it is seen as the beginning of winter. In [[meteorology]], winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start|title=When does spring start?|date=June 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n\nSince prehistory, the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/winter_solstice.htm|title=Winter Solstice celebrations: a.k.a.

Astronomical events were often used to guide activities, such as the [[mating of animals]], the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Many cultural mythologies and traditions are derived from this.\n\nThis is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, such as [[Stonehenge]] in England and [[Newgrange]] in Ireland. The primary [[wikt:axis|axes]] of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that at Stonehenge the Great [[Trilithon]] was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Anthony |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780500051559 |pages=252\u2013253}}</ref>\n\nThe winter solstice was immensely important because the people were economically dependent on monitoring the progress of the seasons. [[Starvation]] was common during the first months of the winter, January to April (northern hemisphere) or July to October (southern hemisphere), also known as \"the [[famine]] months\". In temperate climates, the midwinter festival was the last feast [[Festival|celebration]], before deep winter began. Most cattle were [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed so they would not have to be fed during the winter, so it was almost the only time of year when a plentiful supply of fresh meat was available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas | title=History of Christmas |publisher=History.com |accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> The majority of wine and beer made during the year was finally [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and ready for drinking at this time. The concentration of the observances were not always on the day commencing at midnight or at dawn, but at the beginning of the pagan day, which in many cultures fell on the previous [[evening|eve]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBecause the event was seen as the reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky, concepts of the birth or rebirth of [[sun god]]s have been common. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} In cultures which used cyclic calendars based on the winter solstice, the \"year as reborn\" was celebrated with reference to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth deities]] or \"new beginnings\" such as [[Hogmanay]]'s ''redding'', a [[New Year]] cleaning tradition. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} Also \"reversal\" is yet another frequent theme, as in [[Saturnalia]]'s slave and master reversals.\n\n===Indian===\n{{main| Makar Sankranti}}\nMakara Sankranti, also known as Makaraa Sankr\u0101nti ([[Sanskrit]]: \u092e\u0915\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f) or Maghi, is a festival day in the [[Hindu calendar]], in reference to deity [[Surya]] (sun).

[[Yald\u0101 Night|Yalda night]] celebration, or as some call it \"Shabe Chelleh\" (\"the 40th night\"), is one the oldest Iranian traditions that has been present in Persian culture from the ancient years. In this night all the family gather together, usually at the house of the eldest, and celebrate it by eating, drinking and reciting poetry (esp. Hafez). Nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are particularly served during this festival.\n\n===Germanic===\n{{main|Yule}}\nThe [[Norse paganism|pagan Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic people]] of northern Europe celebrated a winter holiday called [[Yule]] (also called Jul, Julblot, j\u00f3labl\u00f3t). The ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes a Yule feast hosted by the Norwegian king [[Haakon the Good]] (c. 920\u2013961). According to Snorri, the Christian Haakon had moved Yule from \"midwinter\" and aligned it with the Christian Christmas celebration. Historically, this has made some scholars believe that Yule originally was a sun festival on the winter solstice. Modern scholars generally do not believe this, as midwinter in medieval Iceland was a date about four weeks after the solstice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nordberg |first=Andreas |year=2006 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1366945/Jul_disting_och_f%C3%B6rkyrklig_tider%C3%A4kning |title=Jul, disting och f\u00f6rkyrklig tider\u00e4kning: Kalendrar och kalendariska riter i det f\u00f6rkristna Norden |series=Acta Academiae Regiae Gustavi Adolphi |language=Swedish |volume=91 |publisher=Kungl.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], this is the [[December solstice]] (usually 21 or 22 December) and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], this is the [[June solstice]] (usually 20 or 21 June). Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment, the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs. Other names are \"midwinter\", the \"extreme of winter\" ([[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]), or the \"shortest day\". Traditionally, in many [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter, but today in some countries and calendars, it is seen as the beginning of winter. In [[meteorology]], winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start|title=When does spring start?|date=June 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n\nSince prehistory, the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/winter_solstice.htm|title=Winter Solstice celebrations: a.k.a.

Astronomical events were often used to guide activities, such as the [[mating of animals]], the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Many cultural mythologies and traditions are derived from this.\n\nThis is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, such as [[Stonehenge]] in England and [[Newgrange]] in Ireland. The primary [[wikt:axis|axes]] of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that at Stonehenge the Great [[Trilithon]] was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Anthony |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780500051559 |pages=252\u2013253}}</ref>\n\nThe winter solstice was immensely important because the people were economically dependent on monitoring the progress of the seasons. [[Starvation]] was common during the first months of the winter, January to April (northern hemisphere) or July to October (southern hemisphere), also known as \"the [[famine]] months\". In temperate climates, the midwinter festival was the last feast [[Festival|celebration]], before deep winter began. Most cattle were [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed so they would not have to be fed during the winter, so it was almost the only time of year when a plentiful supply of fresh meat was available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas | title=History of Christmas |publisher=History.com |accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> The majority of wine and beer made during the year was finally [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and ready for drinking at this time. The concentration of the observances were not always on the day commencing at midnight or at dawn, but at the beginning of the pagan day, which in many cultures fell on the previous [[evening|eve]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBecause the event was seen as the reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky, concepts of the birth or rebirth of [[sun god]]s have been common. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} In cultures which used cyclic calendars based on the winter solstice, the \"year as reborn\" was celebrated with reference to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth deities]] or \"new beginnings\" such as [[Hogmanay]]'s ''redding'', a [[New Year]] cleaning tradition. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} Also \"reversal\" is yet another frequent theme, as in [[Saturnalia]]'s slave and master reversals.\n\n===Indian===\n{{main| Makar Sankranti}}\nMakara Sankranti, also known as Makaraa Sankr\u0101nti ([[Sanskrit]]: \u092e\u0915\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f) or Maghi, is a festival day in the [[Hindu calendar]], in reference to deity [[Surya]] (sun).

[[Yald\u0101 Night|Yalda night]] celebration, or as some call it \"Shabe Chelleh\" (\"the 40th night\"), is one the oldest Iranian traditions that has been present in Persian culture from the ancient years. In this night all the family gather together, usually at the house of the eldest, and celebrate it by eating, drinking and reciting poetry (esp. Hafez). Nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are particularly served during this festival.\n\n===Germanic===\n{{main|Yule}}\nThe [[Norse paganism|pagan Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic people]] of northern Europe celebrated a winter holiday called [[Yule]] (also called Jul, Julblot, j\u00f3labl\u00f3t). The ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes a Yule feast hosted by the Norwegian king [[Haakon the Good]] (c. 920\u2013961). According to Snorri, the Christian Haakon had moved Yule from \"midwinter\" and aligned it with the Christian Christmas celebration. Historically, this has made some scholars believe that Yule originally was a sun festival on the winter solstice. Modern scholars generally do not believe this, as midwinter in medieval Iceland was a date about four weeks after the solstice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nordberg |first=Andreas |year=2006 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1366945/Jul_disting_och_f%C3%B6rkyrklig_tider%C3%A4kning |title=Jul, disting och f\u00f6rkyrklig tider\u00e4kning: Kalendrar och kalendariska riter i det f\u00f6rkristna Norden |series=Acta Academiae Regiae Gustavi Adolphi |language=Swedish |volume=91 |publisher=Kungl.
