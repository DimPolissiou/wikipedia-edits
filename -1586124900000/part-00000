The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized.<ref name=\"Making\" /> The surprise to fans that Raiden was not Snake was admitted by Kojima to have been inspired by the plot twist of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' where the titular character played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was not a villain in that movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/commentary2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713081833/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/commentary2.html|title=Big Shell Infiltration \uff5e Contact Peter Stillman|publisher=Shinobu Wbes|archivedate=July 13, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref> Raiden's appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game's release in North America.<ref>{{cite video game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote=}}</ref> Due to negative response to Raiden's role in the game, Kojima said in retrospective that the team failed to properly show the character.<ref name=\"spong\"/>\n\n===Further development===\nRaiden's new design for ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa was surprised by the way he illustrated Raiden.

It is widespread in Europe and North Africa, and is categorised by the IUCN as \"least concern\". It should not be confused with the [[Japanese quail]], ''Coturnix japonica'', native to Asia, which, although visually similar, has a very distinct call. Like the Japanese quail, common quails are sometimes kept as [[poultry]].\n\n==Description==\nIt is a small, round bird, essentially streaked brown with a white eyestripe, and, in the male, a white chin. As befits its migratory nature, it has long wings, unlike the typically short-winged gamebirds. It measures roughly {{convert|7.1|-|8.62|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} and weighs {{convert|3.2|-|4.62|oz|g|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=Hume1880/>\n\n==Habits==\nThis is a terrestrial species, feeding on [[seed]]s and [[insect]]s on the ground. It is notoriously difficult to see, keeping hidden in crops, and reluctant to fly, preferring to creep away instead. Even when flushed, it keeps low and soon drops back into cover. Often the only indication of its presence is the distinctive \"wet-my-lips\" repetitive song of the male. The call is uttered mostly in the mornings, evenings and sometimes at night. It is a strongly [[bird migration|migratory]] [[Aves|bird]], unlike most [[game bird]]s.\n\n==Breeding==\nUpon attaining an age of 6\u20138 weeks, this [[quail]] breeds on open [[arable land|arable farmland]] and [[grassland]]  the west [[Palearctic]] including most of [[Europe]] , laying 6-12 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in a ground nest. The eggs take from 16\u201318 days to hatch.\n\n==Subspecies==\nThis species was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''Systema naturae'' in 1758 as ''Tetrao coturnix''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> The Eurasian subspecies, ''C. c. coturnix'', overwinters southwards in Africa's [[Sahel]] and India. The populations on [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]] belong to the nominate subspecies. The African subspecies, ''C. c. africana'', described by [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck|Temminck]] and [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] in 1849, is known as the African quail. It overwinters in Africa, some moving northwards from South Africa. The common quails of [[Madagascar]] and the [[Comoros]] belong to the same African subspecies, although those found around [[Ethiopia]] make up a different subspecies, the Abyssinian quail, ''C. c. erlangeri'' (Zedlitz, 1912). The fairly numerous<ref name=Krabbe2003/> population of the [[Cape Verde]] islands belong to a separate subspecies, ''C. c. inopinata'', (described by [[Ernst Hartert|Hartert]] in 1917), while those on the [[Azores]] belong to subspecies ''C. c. conturbans'' (Hartert, 1920).\n\n==Utilization==\nIt is heavily hunted as [[game (food)|game]] on passage through the [[Mediterranean]] area. This species over recent years has seen an increase in its [[biological reproduction|propagation]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. However, most of this increase is with [[hobbyists]].\n\nIn 1537, Queen [[Jane Seymour]], third wife of [[Henry VIII]], then pregnant with the future King [[Edward VI]], developed an insatiable craving for quail, and courtiers and diplomats abroad were ordered to find sufficient supplies for the Queen.\n\n===Poisoning===\nIf they have eaten certain plants, although which plants is still in debate, the meat from quail can be poisonous, with one in four who consume poisonous flesh becoming ill with [[coturnism]], which is characterized by muscle soreness, and which may lead to [[Rhabdomyolysis|kidney failure]].<ref name=\"pmid18963719\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Korkmaz I, Kukul G\u00fcven FM, Eren SH, Dogan Z |title=Quail Consumption Can Be Harmful |journal=J Emerg Med |volume= 41|issue= 5|pages= 499\u2013502|date=October 2008 |pmid=18963719 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2008.03.045 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15313988\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsironi M, Andriopoulos P, Xamodraka E |title=The patient with rhabdomyolysis: have you considered quail poisoning? |journal=CMAJ |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=325\u20136 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15313988 |pmc=509041 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1031256 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Ouzounellis T | title=Some notes on quail poisoning | journal=JAMA |date=16 February 1970 |volume=211 | issue=7 | pages=1186\u20137 | pmid=4904256 | doi=10.1001/jama.1970.03170070056017}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Weibliche Wachtel (Coturnix coturnix).jpg|Female\nFile:Quail from the Crossley ID Guide Britain and Ireland.jpg|ID composite\nFile:Caille des bl\u00e9s MHNT.jpg|Eggs - [[MHNT]]\nFile:Coturnix coturnix MWNH 2037.JPG|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]\nFile:Head of Coturnix coturnix - Herbert Goodchild.jpg|Head of nominate subspecies\nFile:Head of Coturnix capensis - Herbert Goodchild.jpg|Head of ''Coturnix coturnix africana''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quails in cookery]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Hume1880>{{cite book |last1=Hume |first1=A.O. |last2=Marshall |first2=C.H.T. |title=Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon |year=1880 |publisher=A.O.

{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed. The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail.

The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields.

The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.
