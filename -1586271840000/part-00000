His dock was built in the middle of the crescent-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island, which offered the only natural deep-water harbor between Chicago and Buffalo. In 1847, the village included Burton's Wharf, a house, blacksmith shop, grocery store, barn, and a wooden tamarack railroad track extending from the dock inland to haul wood for the steamers. When the first post office opened in 1870, it was located here. When logging operations ended and the dock fell into disrepair, the original island village dwindled in size and importance. Burdick's moved their general store from its original location near the old dock to a site near the Lifesaving station in 1923 on the southeastern shore, and that marked the shift of the island community to the current village site located at the present dock where the passenger ferry arrives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/slbe/historyculture/southmanitoughost.htm |title=NPS South Manitou History |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\nFarming developed slowly on the island, but by 1870 most islanders were self-sufficient farmers. Surplus crops were sold to passing ships and mainland markets. The isolation of the island provided an ideal environment for growing prize-winning rye, beans and peas. Today, there are no active farms on the island, but farm buildings, abandoned machinery, the old school and cemetery are reminders of the past. The island is now uninhabited, and most of its buildings lie in ruins.<ref name=\"nps\" />\n\n==Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service Station==\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Blueprint.jpg|thumbnail|right|South Manitou Island Light Blueprint]]\nSouth Manitou Island was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries as a harbor and fueling station.  With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1826, the development of commercial navigation on the Great Lakes increased rapidly. The Manitou Passage was the most important route for schooners and steamers traveling the 300 mile length of Lake Michigan. The island was a stop for early mariners between [[Chicago]] and the [[Straits of Mackinac]].\n\nTo guide storm-driven ships, Congress appropriated $5,000 in 1838 for the construction of a lighthouse. Construction began in 1839, but very little is known about this first lighthouse on South Manitou Island. The specifications were the same as for the Old Presque Isle lighthouse, which included a 30-foot circular tower and a stone keeper's dwelling, but written accounts describe a 1.5 story house with a light tower on one gable end. No sketches or photos exist to determine what was actually built. The location of the light was on a 30-foot sandy knoll near the shore close to the location of the present lighthouse, but the exact location is not known.\n\nIn 1858, the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment recognized the need for greater safety and replaced this house with a two-story brick residence with a 35-foot tower on top. The tower housed a Fourth Order Fresnel lens. A fog signal building was added and both structures still stand today.\n\nThe increased shipping traffic brought changes and in 1871, a 100-foot tower was built. The tower is 18 feet in diameter at the base. The walls are hollow and 5 feet thick at the base tapering to 3 feet thick at the top. A passageway was added connecting the tower to the keeper's dwelling. A Third Order Fresnel lens from Paris was installed with a 3-wick lamp that had a range of 18 miles. In 1875, the first steam fog signal on Lake Michigan was installed replacing the fog bell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/slbe/planyourvisit/smilighthouse.htm |title=NPS South Manitou Lighthouse  |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> The 100 foot [[South Manitou Island Light|lighthouse]] was in operation from 1871 to 1958.

The USLSS became part of the United States Coast Guard in 1915. The station was permanently closed in 1958.

During the \"[[Great Lakes Storm of 1913|Big Blow]]\" of 1913, Captain John Stufflebeam nosed the bow of the passenger/packet steamer ''Illinois'' up onto the beach. He kept the engines going full for 49 hours so the wind would not blow the vessel back out to sea, until he was able to send two seamen ashore to fasten to a stout tree. When the storm abated 24 hours later, he untied from the tree, put his engines in reverse and backed away from shore to proceed safely on his journey.<ref>''True Tales of the Great Lakes'' by Dwight Boyer, Dodd Mead & Company, New York, 1971, {{ISBN|0-396-06372-1}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{More footnotes|section|date=June 2014}}\n*[https://archive.today/20200211184618/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&-context=dt&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-CHECK_SEARCH_RESULTS=N&-CONTEXT=dt&-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&-tree_id=4001&-transpose=N&-redoLog=true&-all_geo_types=N&-_caller=geoselect&-geo_id=100$10000US260899704001180&-geo_id=100$10000US260899704001181&-search_results=100$10000US260899703001101&-format=&-_lang=en&-show_geoid=Y South Manitou Island: Blocks 1180 and 1181, Census Tract 9704, Leelanau County, Michigan] United States Census Bureau\n*''Inventory of Maritime and Recreation Resources of the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve'', Kennth J.

Eozen married Agnes of Cornouaille (Orguen Kernev), the daughter of [[Alain Canhiart|Alan Canhiart, Count of Cornouaille]] and sister of [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany]] who was married in 1066 to Eozen's niece [[Hawise, Duchess of Brittany]].\n\n==Role in Governance of Brittany==\nWhen Eozen's father Duke{{efn|The title of Duke of Brittany had not yet been recognized by the King of France, although it was in use since [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany]]. Since Brittany was not in fact under the French Crown until the late 15th century, and not incorporated into the French State until the French Revolution, what the King of France thought is a moot point.}} Geoffrey I died on 20 November 1008, both Eozen and his older brother [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany|Alan]] were minors.\n\nDuke Geoffrey had initiated a dynastic double marriage with [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]] by marrying [[Hawise of Normandy]], one of Richard's sisters, in 996; this was followed by the marriage of Geoffrey's sister [[Judith of Brittany]] to Richard around the year 1000.  Alan and Eozen were thus double-first cousins of Duke Richard II's children, including [[Richard III, Duke of Normandy]] and [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] (William the Conqueror's father), nephews of [[Emma of Normandy]], and first cousins of Emma's children [[Edward the Confessor]], [[Harthacnut]], [[Goda of England]], [[Gunhilda of Denmark]] and [[Alfred Aetheling]].\n\nAt Geoffrey's death, Alan became ''de jure'' Duke, as [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany]],{{efn|In some histories Eozen is shown co-Duke with his brother Alan, followed by a period where Alan ruled as Duke of Brittany alone. Eozen's position as co-Duke is unlikely and remains an historical uncertainty in search of documented proof. In any event Alan would go on to shed the control of Normandy circa 1026, and from this date it is clear there was no ruling role for Eozen until Alan died.}} Hawise took on the role of Regent, and Richard asserted the role of Guardian of Brittany, an arrangement reciprocated on the death of [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] in 1035.\n\nAlso in 1035, after a dispute between Eozen and Duke Alan III, their uncle Judica\u00ebl Bishop of [[Vannes]] arbitrated, and Alan III gave Eozen the bishoprics of [[Saint-Brieuc]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Tr\u00e9guier]] and [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], as well as the counties and baronies of Penthi\u00e8vre, Go\u00eblo, Avaugour and [[Lamballe]]. Eozen placed his capital at Lamballe, where he began issuing coins in his own name.\n\nFollowing the death of his brother Duke [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany|Alan III]] in 1040, Eozen ruled as regent of Brittany in the name of his nephew [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]], holding Conan in custody. Conan was freed by his supporters in 1047. Eozen's regency should have ended when Conan reached his majority (circa 1054), but Eozen refused to relinquish control of the Duchy.\n\nIn 1054 Geoffrey, Viscount of Mayenne in Maine, affronted by William of Normandy's new fortifications at Ambrieres, \"appealed to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou\" who \"called to his assistance Guy-William of Aquitaine and Count Eudo of Brittany\"<ref>{{cite book |title=William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England| author=David Charles Douglas| page=71| publisher=University of California Press| date=1967}}</ref>\n\nIn a charter dated to 1056/1060, Eozen (\"Eudo\") granted land \"in pago Belvacensi\" ([[Beauvais]], [[Picardy]]) to the Abbey of [[Angers]] Saint-Aubin (q.v. [[Albinus of Angers]]).  Witnesses included his wife Orguen and their sons Gausfridus, Alanus Rufus, Willelmus, Rotbertus and Ricardus (Geoffrey, Alan Rufus, William, Robert and Richard).\n\nBy 1056 Conan gained the upper hand in Brittany, and in 1057 he captured his uncle Eozen and chained him in a prison cell. Eozen's eldest son Geoffrey Boterel continued to fight.\n\nIn 1062, peace was concluded between Conan and Geoffrey. Eozen, who was now free, continued the fight alone.\n\nIn histories favourable to the house of Penthi\u00e8vre, Eozen is shown as effectively ruling Brittany between 1040 and 1062. In other histories his rule is shown as ending with his capture in 1057.\n\nConan was a legitimate contender for the title of Duke of Normandy, so he became a serious rival to Duke William.\n\nIn 1064, Eozen's liegeman [[Rivallon I of Dol]] invited Duke William to join him against Conan, thus initiating the [[Breton-Norman War]] of 1064\u20131065 in which [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], [[Dol de Bretagne]] and the captive [[Harold Godwinson]] combined against Conan II, as depicted in three panels of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Historians differ on whether William or Conan should be considered the victor in this conflict.\n\n==Involvement in the Preparations for the Norman Conquest of England==\nEozen provided, trained and equipped 5000 Breton soldiers for [[William the Conqueror]]'s army. Of these, 4000 were professionals, comprising light cavalry, heavy cavalry, archers, crossbowmen and axemen; he also trained 1000 levied (conscripted) spearmen. Eozen put these troops on 100 ships under the command of his sons Count [[Alan Rufus]] and Count [[Brian of Brittany|Brian]], and they sailed from Brittany to join the Norman forces gathering at [[Barfleur]] then on to William's staging point at [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]], in readiness to cross the Channel.\n\n==Rebellion against Hoel II of Brittany==\nDespite his advanced years, Eozen was involved in the failed 1075/1076 rebellion against [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany]], by Geoffrey Grenonat of Rennes and [[Ralph de Gael]] (fresh from his 1075 rebellion against King William). Hoel II was supported by [[William the Conqueror]], briefly placing Eozen and William on opposing sides once again, a situation that was soon resolved when, to William's disappointment, Hoel came to terms with the rebels.\n\n==Death==\nOn 7 January 1079, at about 80 years of age, Eozen died in [[Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9]], an eastern suburb of [[Rennes]]. He was buried in [[Saint-Brieuc Cathedral]].\n\nIn his memory, \u201cComes Alanus Rufus\u201d (Count Alan Rufus), his second son, donated property to [[Swavesey]] Abbey in [[Cambridgeshire]], for the soul of \u201cpatris sui Eudonis comitis\u201d (his father Count Eozen), by an undated charter witnessed by \u201c\u2026Ribaldus et Bardulfus fratres comitis\u2026\u201d (Ribald and Bardulf, brothers of Count Alan).\n\n==Family==\nThomas Forester's 1854 translation of volume 2 of [[Orderic Vitalis]]\u2019s ''The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy'', book 5, chapter 9, section 43 and page 164, last paragraph, states concerning Eozen's sons:\n\n\u201cGod also gave him seven sons, who became remarkable for the singular and changeable events of their lives. The studious might compose a long and pleasing history, from true accounts of their various fortunes.\u201d\n\nEozen's children with Agnes include:\n\n*Ad\u00e8le (born c. 1035, died after 1056/1057).<ref>St\u00e9phane Morin, ''Tr\u00e9gor, Go\u00eblo, Penthi\u00e8vre.

He is presumed to have been illegitimate, though his title of Count suggests that he was a legitimate son, as does the genealogy in Gale's edition of the Registry of the Honour of Richmond which gives his wife's name as Imogen. Brian participated in the conquest of England. The website of Charles Cawley reports that Brian (French: Brien; Latin: Briennius) defeated a second raid in the southwest of England, launched from Ireland by [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]]'s sons in 1069. Brian's forces then went north to counter the rebellion by [[Eadric the Wild]], as William the Conqueror's army travelled west; the two armies joined and won the Battle of [[Stafford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/miketallent/Battle%20of%20Stafford.htm|title=Battle of Stafford|last=Tallent|first=Mike|accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> For a time, Brian held the Honour of Brittany, including 227 manors in Cornwall and a number in eastern England. However, he became an invalid and subsequently relinquished all his estates in south-west England (William then gave them to his own half-brother [[Robert, Count of Mortain]]), and retired to Brittany to be with his bride. He is recorded as a witness to two documents issued by Geoffrey I Boterel in 1084.

The timing of the lives of Alan Rufus and Stephen of Tr\u00e9guier suggests that Brian did not hold Richmond. It is reported elsewhere that he was an Earl of Cornwall but resigned the title and returned to Brittany; Brian's lands in England were then granted by King William I to the latter's half-brother Robert, Count of Mortain.

Eozen married Agnes of Cornouaille (Orguen Kernev), the daughter of [[Alain Canhiart|Alan Canhiart, Count of Cornouaille]] and sister of [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany]] who was married in 1066 to Eozen's niece [[Hawise, Duchess of Brittany]].\n\n==Role in Governance of Brittany==\nWhen Eozen's father Duke{{efn|The title of Duke of Brittany had not yet been recognized by the King of France, although it was in use since [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany]]. Since Brittany was not in fact under the French Crown until the late 15th century, and not incorporated into the French State until the French Revolution, what the King of France thought is a moot point.}} Geoffrey I died on 20 November 1008, both Eozen and his older brother [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany|Alan]] were minors.\n\nDuke Geoffrey had initiated a dynastic double marriage with [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]] by marrying [[Hawise of Normandy]], one of Richard's sisters, in 996; this was followed by the marriage of Geoffrey's sister [[Judith of Brittany]] to Richard around the year 1000.  Alan and Eozen were thus double-first cousins of Duke Richard II's children, including [[Richard III, Duke of Normandy]] and [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] (William the Conqueror's father), nephews of [[Emma of Normandy]], and first cousins of Emma's children [[Edward the Confessor]], [[Harthacnut]], [[Goda of England]], [[Gunhilda of Denmark]] and [[Alfred Aetheling]].\n\nAt Geoffrey's death, Alan became ''de jure'' Duke, as [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany]],{{efn|In some histories Eozen is shown co-Duke with his brother Alan, followed by a period where Alan ruled as Duke of Brittany alone. Eozen's position as co-Duke is unlikely and remains an historical uncertainty in search of documented proof. In any event Alan would go on to shed the control of Normandy circa 1026, and from this date it is clear there was no ruling role for Eozen until Alan died.}} Hawise took on the role of Regent, and Richard asserted the role of Guardian of Brittany, an arrangement reciprocated on the death of [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] in 1035.\n\nAlso in 1035, after a dispute between Eozen and Duke Alan III, their uncle Judica\u00ebl Bishop of [[Vannes]] arbitrated, and Alan III gave Eozen the bishoprics of [[Saint-Brieuc]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Tr\u00e9guier]] and [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], as well as the counties and baronies of Penthi\u00e8vre, Go\u00eblo, Avaugour and [[Lamballe]]. Eozen placed his capital at Lamballe, where he began issuing coins in his own name.\n\nFollowing the death of his brother Duke [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany|Alan III]] in 1040, Eozen ruled as regent of Brittany in the name of his nephew [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]], holding Conan in custody. Conan was freed by his supporters in 1047. Eozen's regency should have ended when Conan reached his majority (circa 1054), but Eozen refused to relinquish control of the Duchy.\n\nIn 1054 Geoffrey, Viscount of Mayenne in Maine, affronted by William of Normandy's new fortifications at Ambrieres, \"appealed to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou\" who \"called to his assistance Guy-William of Aquitaine and Count Eudo of Brittany\"<ref>{{cite book |title=William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England| author=David Charles Douglas| page=71| publisher=University of California Press| date=1967}}</ref>\n\nIn a charter dated to 1056/1060, Eozen (\"Eudo\") granted land \"in pago Belvacensi\" ([[Beauvais]], [[Picardy]]) to the Abbey of [[Angers]] Saint-Aubin (q.v. [[Albinus of Angers]]).  Witnesses included his wife Orguen and their sons Gausfridus, Alanus Rufus, Willelmus, Rotbertus and Ricardus (Geoffrey, Alan Rufus, William, Robert and Richard).\n\nBy 1056 Conan gained the upper hand in Brittany, and in 1057 he captured his uncle Eozen and chained him in a prison cell. Eozen's eldest son Geoffrey Boterel continued to fight.\n\nIn 1062, peace was concluded between Conan and Geoffrey. Eozen, who was now free, continued the fight alone.\n\nIn histories favourable to the house of Penthi\u00e8vre, Eozen is shown as effectively ruling Brittany between 1040 and 1062. In other histories his rule is shown as ending with his capture in 1057.\n\nConan was a legitimate contender for the title of Duke of Normandy, so he became a serious rival to Duke William.\n\nIn 1064, Eozen's liegeman [[Rivallon I of Dol]] invited Duke William to join him against Conan, thus initiating the [[Breton-Norman War]] of 1064-1065 in which [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], [[Dol de Bretagne]] and the captive [[Harold Godwinson]] combined against Conan II, as depicted in three panels of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Historians differ on whether William or Conan should be considered the victor in this conflict.\n\n==Involvement in the Preparations for the Norman Conquest of England==\nEozen provided, trained and equipped 5000 Breton soldiers for [[William the Conqueror]]'s army. Of these, 4000 were professionals, comprising light cavalry, heavy cavalry, archers, crossbowmen and axemen; he also trained 1000 levied (conscripted) spearmen. Eozen put these troops on 100 ships under the command of his sons Count [[Alan Rufus]] and Count [[Brian of Brittany|Brian]], and they sailed from Brittany to join the Norman forces gathering at [[Barfleur]] then on to William's staging point at [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]], in readiness to cross the Channel.\n\n==Rebellion against Hoel II of Brittany==\nDespite his advanced years, Eozen was involved in the failed 1075/1076 rebellion against [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany]], by Geoffrey Grenonat of Rennes and [[Ralph de Gael]] (fresh from his 1075 rebellion against King William). Hoel II was supported by [[William the Conqueror]], briefly placing Eozen and William on opposing sides once again, a situation that was soon resolved when, to William's disappointment, Hoel came to terms with the rebels.\n\n==Death==\nOn 7 January 1079, at about 80 years of age, Eozen died in [[Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9]], an eastern suburb of [[Rennes]]. He was buried in [[Saint-Brieuc Cathedral]].\n\nIn his memory, \u201cComes Alanus Rufus\u201d (Count Alan Rufus), his second son, donated property to [[Swavesey]] Abbey in [[Cambridgeshire]], for the soul of \u201cpatris sui Eudonis comitis\u201d (his father Count Eozen), by an undated charter witnessed by \u201c\u2026Ribaldus et Bardulfus fratres comitis\u2026\u201d (Ribald and Bardulf, brothers of Count Alan).\n\n==Family==\nThomas Forester\u2019s 1854 translation of volume 2 of [[Orderic Vitalis]]\u2019s ''The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy'', book 5, chapter 9, section 43 and page 164, last paragraph, states concerning Eozen's sons:\n\n\u201cGod also gave him seven sons, who became remarkable for the singular and changeable events of their lives.

He is presumed to have been illegitimate, though his title of Count suggests that he was a legitimate son, as does the genealogy in Gale's edition of the Registry of the Honour of Richmond which gives his wife's name as Imogen. Brian participated in the conquest of England. The website of Charles Cawley reports that Brian (French: Brien; Latin: Briennius) defeated a second raid in the southwest of England, launched from Ireland by [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]]'s sons in 1069. Brian's forces then went north to counter the rebellion by [[Eadric the Wild]], as William the Conqueror's army travelled west; the two armies joined and won the Battle of [[Stafford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/miketallent/Battle%20of%20Stafford.htm|title=Battle of Stafford|last=Tallent|first=Mike|accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> For a time, Brian held the Honour of Brittany, including 227 manors in Cornwall and a number in eastern England. However, he became an invalid and subsequently relinquished all his estates in south-west England (William then gave them to his own half-brother [[Robert, Count of Mortain]]), and retired to Brittany to be with his bride. He is recorded as a witness to two documents issued by Geoffrey I Boterel in 1084.

The timing of the lives of Alan Rufus and Stephen of Tr\u00e9guier suggests that Brian did not hold Richmond. It is reported elsewhere that he was an Earl of Cornwall but resigned the title and returned to Brittany; Brian's lands in England were then granted by King William I to the latter's half-brother Robert, Count of Mortain. During the Anarchy, [[Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan the Black II]] claimed Cornwall on the basis of his uncle Brian having held it; a claim that was accepted by [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].}}\n*[[Alan Rufus]] (Latin; alternatively Alain Le Roux in French, or Alan Ar Rouz in Breton, called Count Alan in the [[Domesday Book]], his name means \"Red Deer\" or \"Hart\") (d. between 1093 and 1098).

Marten had a passion for playing various different musical instruments but soon considered bass his main instrument. Marten once asked his father to buy him a guitar only to have the guitar traded in for a bass two weeks later. At the age of 16 he had already performed shows and recorded with various local bands but he had bigger aspirations. He wanted to take on Hollywood. By the age of 18 Marten moved to Los Angeles to study music and it did not take long before he started touring the world and recording with the heavy metal band [[Lizzy Borden (band)|Lizzy Borden]]. Named after the band's lead vocalist and known for their outrageous and theatrical stage shows.\n\nMarten Andersson spent the next decade with '''Lizzy Borden''', recording CDs and playing/touring together with bands such as: [[Deep Purple]], [[Kings X]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]. Lizzy Borden released 9 albums and toured across the U.S. South America, Canada, Europe and Asia. Hitting the top 100 4 times in the U.S., #1 on CMJ (radio). Lizzy Borden previewed their CD 'Deal With the Devil' at the 'Wacken open air Festival Germany', in front of 35 thousand people followed by a worldwide tour. Longtime Lizzy Borden fan, artist and multimedia entrepreneur [[Todd McFarlane]] (best known for his creation of ''[[Spawn (1997 film)|Spawn]]'' and stylistic revision of [[Spider-Man]]) was enlisted to capture the essence of Lizzy Borden for the Stage show and the CD cover art. Tragedy struck the band when guitarists Alex Nelson (2004) and Corey James (2009) were killed in separate car accidents, with Nelson's resulting in the band disbanding between 2004 and 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Borden announced that they have reformed with new guitarist [[Ira Black (musician)|Ira Black]] and on November 1, 2007 \"Appointment With Death\" was released worldwide. The CD also features guest appearances by George Lynch (Dokken/Lynch mob), Jonas Hansson (Silver Mountain), Dave Meniketti (Y&T), Corey Beaulieu (Trivium) among others. The video for \"Tomorrow Never Comes\" was nominated for video of the year and was in the Top 25 Metal Videos of 2008 on MTV's Headbangers Ball. The follow-up video for \"Under Your Skin\" premiered in April the same year.\n\nIn early 2008, the band announced various festival appearances including Sweden Rock Festival (Sweden), Kobetasonik festival (Spain) and Bang Your Head Festival (Germany). In November 2008, Lizzy Borden toured the United States with Finnish Monster Rockers [[Lordi]]. Lizzy Borden was the first-day headliner of the two-day Keep It True XII festival at Tauberfrankenhalle in Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen Germany. In 2010 the band performed at Rocklahoma and Rock Gone Wild festivals in North America and announced Japan tour dates and 2 extensive European tours, performing in 15 Countries including festival appearances throughout the world.\n\nIn 2011 Lizzy Borden Launched \"Summer of Blood\" tour in North American Followed by the European version, entitled \"Death Takes a Holiday Tour\", festival appearances in 2011 included Heaven and Hell Metal Fest, Christmas Metal Festival, Hard Rock Hell Festival.\n \nIn 2012, Lizzy Borden performed on various Open Air Festivals in Mexico and Europe.

Marten had a passion for playing various different musical instruments but soon considered bass his main instrument. Marten once asked his father to buy him a guitar only to have the guitar traded in for a bass two weeks later. At the age of 16 he had already performed shows and recorded with various local bands but he had bigger aspirations. He wanted to take on Hollywood. By the age of 18 Marten moved to Los Angeles to study music and it did not take long before he started touring the world and recording with the heavy metal band [[Lizzy Borden (band)|Lizzy Borden]].
