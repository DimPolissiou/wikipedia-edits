{"title_page": "Lorenzo Perosi", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Perosi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Don Perosi (''c''. 1900).]]\n\nMonsignor '''Lorenzo Perosi''' (21 December 1872 \u2013 12 October 1956) was an Italian [[composer]] of [[sacred music]] and the only member of the [[Giovane Scuola]] who did not write opera.  In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his twenties, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale [[oratorio]]s. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Romain Rolland]] wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" <ref>''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' (21 November 1899)</ref>  Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe.  A 19 March 1899 ''New York Times'' article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized [[Pietro Mascagni]] by his fellow-countrymen.\"  [[Gianandrea Gavazzeni]] made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\"<ref>Massimo Bruni, ''Lorenzo Perosi'' (Tortona, 1972), p. 9.</ref>  Perosi worked for five [[Pope]]s, including [[Pope Pius X]] who greatly fostered his rise.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and education===\nLorenzo Perosi was born at [[Tortona]], [[Piedmont]], in Italy. Many sources<ref name=\"grovemusic.com\">Waterhouse, John C.G. \"Lorenzo Perosi.\" Grove music online, ed. L. Macy (accessed 20 December 2006).  www.grovemusic.com.</ref>  give December 20 as Perosi's birthdate but recent scholarship suggests December 21 to be correct.<ref>In Mario Rinaldi's ''Lorenzo Perosi'' the correct date is given as December 21 (page 17 explains why that is correct).</ref>  Perosi was one of twelve<ref>Graziella Merlatti, ''Lorenzo Perosi, una vita tra genio e follia'' (Milan, 2006), p. 14</ref> children, one of six to survive infancy.  Perosi hailed from an extremely musical and religious family. For nearly 200 years before him, all of Lorenzo's ancestors were church musicians. His father was Giuseppe Perosi (1849\u20131908), ''Maestro di Cappella'' (Choir Director) of [[Tortona]] Cathedral and one of Italy's most prominent church musicians. Giuseppe was the first teacher of Lorenzo as well as his other two sons, [[Carlo Perosi|Carlo]] (who became a priest and then a cardinal) and [[Marziano Perosi|Marziano]] (who was Maestro di Cappella at the [[Duomo of Milan]] from 1930 to 1949).  In Milan Lorenzo studied with respected professor [[Michele Saladino]] of the Milan Conservatory. Even when he was not enrolled at the Conservatory, Perosi kept up a correspondence course with Saladino.\n\nIn 1890, 18 years old and still a student, Perosi obtained his first professional post: organist and \"teacher of the piano novices\" at the [[Abbey of Montecassino]]. He received his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1892, following which he spent an influential year of study with [[Franz Xaver Haberl]] in [[Regensburg]], at the Kirchenmusikschule that Haberl had founded in 1874. A noted musician and musicologist, Haberl was the pioneering editor of the complete works of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Lassus]]. Perosi's development was such that Haberl offered him a ''cattedra'' (\"chair,\" or permanent teaching position) in the Kirchenmusikschule. The homesick Perosi politely declined, in favour of a post as teacher and director of sacred music at [[Imola]]. As Perosi himself explained, he \"desired and prayed at length to the Lord to be able to do something for the music of God in Italy.\"<ref>Letter from Perosi to Mons. Domenico Baruzzi, secretary to Bishop Tesorieri of Imola (13 September 1893).  Riproduced in Onofri, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Perosi served in Imola from November 1892, to August 1894.\n\nIn 1894 Perosi went to [[Solesmes Abbey]] to study with the Gregorianists [[Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau|Dom Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau]] and [[Joseph Pothier|Dom Joseph Pothier]]. The Renaissance polyphony he learned from Haberl, and the [[Gregorian chant]] he studied in Solesmes were the two pillars upon which the entire oeuvre of Perosi rested.\n\n===Years in Venice===\nFrom Imola, Perosi obtained a more important post, that of Maestro of the [[Cappella Marciana]] at [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]. This Venetian appointment resulted from the deep friendship between Perosi and Cardinal Giuseppe [[Pope Pius X|Sarto]], then Patriarca di Venezia (Patriarch of Venice) but soon to be [[Pope Pius X]] (and still later Pope Saint Pius X). Sarto was a profound music-lover who was disturbed by the roughly hundred years (c.1800\u20131900) that Gregorian Chant was absent from the Church. A more operatic, entertaining style of music prevailed. Thus, Perosi found in Sarto not only a friend and kindred spirit, but also a staunch sponsor.\n\nPerosi's Venetian appointment (1894) unleashed a torrent of music that lasted at least until 1907. He continued to compose prolifically until his death, but this 13-year period produced some of his most substantial work.\n\nIn 1895, Perosi became a priest, having been ordained by his good friend Cardinal Patriarch Sarto (the later [[Saint Pius X]]) himself. It should also be mentioned that [[St. Luigi Orione]] was, like Perosi, born in Tortona in 1872.

Five years later, Sarto was elected Pope Pius X. Just months after his coronation, he released a [[Motu Proprio]] ''[[Tra le sollecitudini]]'' on sacred music. It gave Gregorian Chant a privileged status as the ideal form of liturgical music, banned women vocalists, severely restricted the use of any instrument but the organ, and prohibited the adaptation of secular music for church use.\n\n[[File:PerosiSistina.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Don Perosi with his ''scuola di canto'' (singschool, ''c''. 1905).]]Perosi remained Maestro Perpetuo until his death over 50 years later, in spite of interruptions in his directorship.

In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his twenties, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale [[oratorio]]s. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Romain Rolland]] wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" <ref>''Le Journal des D\u00e9bats'' (21 November 1899)</ref>  Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe.  A 19 March 1899 ''New York Times'' article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized [[Pietro Mascagni]] by his fellow-countrymen.\"  [[Gianandrea Gavazzeni]] made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\"<ref>Massimo Bruni, ''Lorenzo Perosi'' (Tortona, 1972), p. 9.</ref>  Perosi worked for five [[Pope]]s, including [[Pope Pius X]] who greatly fostered his rise.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and education===\nLorenzo Perosi was born at [[Tortona]], [[Piedmont]], in Italy. Many sources<ref name=\"grovemusic.com\">Waterhouse, John C.G. \"Lorenzo Perosi.\" Grove music online, ed. L. Macy (accessed 20 December 2006).  www.grovemusic.com.</ref>  give December 20 as Perosi's birthdate but recent scholarship suggests December 21 to be correct.<ref>In Mario Rinaldi's ''Lorenzo Perosi'' the correct date is given as December 21 (page 17 explains why that is correct).</ref>  Perosi was one of twelve<ref>Graziella Merlatti, ''Lorenzo Perosi, una vita tra genio e follia'' (Milan, 2006), p. 14</ref> children, one of six to survive infancy.  Perosi hailed from an extremely musical and religious family. For nearly 200 years before him, all of Lorenzo's ancestors were church musicians. His father was Giuseppe Perosi (1849\u20131908), ''Maestro di Cappella'' (Choir Director) of [[Tortona]] Cathedral and one of Italy's most prominent church musicians. Giuseppe was the first teacher of Lorenzo as well as his other two sons, [[Carlo Perosi|Carlo]] (who became a priest and then a cardinal) and [[Marziano Perosi|Marziano]] (who was Maestro di Cappella at the [[Duomo of Milan]] from 1930 to 1949).  In Milan Lorenzo studied with respected professor [[Michele Saladino]] of the Milan Conservatory. Even when he was not enrolled at the Conservatory, Perosi kept up a correspondence course with Saladino.\n\nIn 1890, 18 years old and still a student, Perosi obtained his first professional post: organist and \"teacher of the piano novices\" at the [[Abbey of Montecassino]]. He received his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1892, following which he spent an influential year of study with [[Franz Xaver Haberl]] in [[Regensburg]], at the Kirchenmusikschule that Haberl had founded in 1874. A noted musician and musicologist, Haberl was the pioneering editor of the complete works of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Lassus]]. Perosi's development was such that Haberl offered him a ''cattedra'' (\"chair,\" or permanent teaching position) in the Kirchenmusikschule. The homesick Perosi politely declined, in favour of a post as teacher and director of sacred music at [[Imola]]. As Perosi himself explained, he \"desired and prayed at length to the Lord to be able to do something for the music of God in Italy.\"<ref>Letter from Perosi to Mons. Domenico Baruzzi, secretary to Bishop Tesorieri of Imola (13 September 1893).  Riproduced in Onofri, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Perosi served in Imola from November 1892, to August 1894.\n\nIn 1894 Perosi went to [[Solesmes Abbey]] to study with the Gregorianists [[Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau|Dom Andr\u00e9 Mocquereau]] and [[Joseph Pothier|Dom Joseph Pothier]]. The Renaissance polyphony he learned from Haberl, and the [[Gregorian chant]] he studied in Solesmes were the two pillars upon which the entire oeuvre of Perosi rested.\n\n===Years in Venice===\nFrom Imola, Perosi obtained a more important post, that of Maestro of the [[Cappella Marciana]] at [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]. This Venetian appointment resulted from the deep friendship between Perosi and Cardinal Giuseppe [[Pope Pius X|Sarto]], then Patriarca di Venezia (Patriarch of Venice) but soon to be [[Pope Pius X]] (and still later Pope Saint Pius X). Sarto was a profound music-lover who was disturbed by the roughly hundred years (c.1800\u20131900) that Gregorian Chant was absent from the Church. A more operatic, entertaining style of music prevailed. Thus, Perosi found in Sarto not only a friend and kindred spirit, but also a staunch sponsor.\n\nPerosi's Venetian appointment (1894) unleashed a torrent of music that lasted at least until 1907. He continued to compose prolifically until his death, but this 13-year period produced some of his most substantial work.\n\nIn 1895, Perosi became a priest, having been ordained by his good friend Cardinal Patriarch Sarto (the later [[Saint Pius X]]) himself. It should also be mentioned that [[St. Luigi Orione]] was, like Perosi, born in Tortona in 1872. The three men\u2014Orione, Perosi, and Sarto\u2014were all dear friends and mutual inspirers.\n\nDon Perosi was inspired by the later Pope Pius X also to infuse priestly sanctity into the music, and Perosi daily offered [[Tridentine Mass|Mass]] and spent many hours in prayer.\n\n===Vatican appointment===\n[[File:PerosiToscanini.jpg|left|thumb|Perosi and [[Toscanini]], in Milan for the world-premi\u00e8re of ''Mos\u00e8'' (1901).]]\nIn 1898, Cardinal Sarto used his influence with [[Pope Leo XIII]] to get Perosi the  post of Maestro Perpetuo della Cappella Sistina, or Perpetual Director of the [[Sistine Choir]], in Rome.
