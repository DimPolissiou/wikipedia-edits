She was 18 years old in 1974 when she and hired killer Marthinus Choegoe stabbed Susanna Magdalena van der Linde, the wife of Lehnberg\u2019s 47-year-old lover Christiaan van der Linde, to death with a pair of [[scissors]].  At 19 she was then the youngest woman to be convicted of murder in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/fourteen-year-old-girl-found-guilty-of-murder-223537 |title=Fourteen-year-old girl found guilty of murder |first=Ingrid |last=Oellermann |date=8 October 2004 |newspaper=IOL |accessdate=2017-02-02}}</ref> Both Lehnberg and Marthinus Choegoe received the [[death penalty]], but this was later set aside and she served 11 years of her 20-year sentence in [[Pollsmoor Prison]] outside [[Cape Town]].\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1972, Lehnberg began her first job as a clerical assistant/receptionist at the [[Red Cross Children's Hospital]] in [[Rondebosch]], [[Cape Town]]. She started work in the [[orthopaedic]] workshop alongside Christiaan van der Linde.  Van der Linde was the workshop's chief technician and Lehnberg, a bright, intelligent and attractive 16-year-old, was apparently drawn to him from the start.\n\nLehnberg's upbringing had been both ultra-conservative and strict. Her father was puritanical, a man who rarely displayed any affection towards his daughters.  She had not been allowed to socialise and had never been to the cinema during the time she was in high school, she was a very intelligent young girl academically and often came first in her class but had no experience of boys or men, she was very naive and innocent and tried hard to get attention via her studies. She was drawn to van der Linde, a person whom she saw as a being warm and friendly [[father figure]]. She later recalled \"he said \"welcome\" and my heart beat faster.\"\n\nVan der Linde and Lehnberg struck up a father-daughter type relationship which grew closer as the months passed. In April 1973, a year after they first met, the couple began an affair.\n\n==The affair==\nThroughout the remainder of 1973, Lehnberg and Van der Linde continued to meet in secret at [[Rondebosch Common]] and [[Paarden Eiland]]. Then, early in 1974, their intimacy stopped. Van der Linde suspected that they were being watched because his wife was receiving anonymous telephone calls.\n\nDespite the fact that Van der Linde had declared that he would never leave his wife and family, Lehnberg was convinced that the only obstacle to them having a more permanent relationship was the presence of Van der Linde's wife, Susanna.\n\nBy July 1974, Lehnberg was becoming desperate and started talking about leaving Cape Town.  Christiaan van der Linde persuaded her not to, but by September she had finally tired of the situation and decided to confront Susanna. Lehnberg called and explained that she and Christiaan were very much in love and were seeing each other every night.  She wanted to know what Susanna van der Linde intended doing, but Susanna van der Linde hung up on her.  A few weeks later, Lehnberg telephoned again. This time she made an appointment to go and see her.  They met in [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]] early in October.\n\nInitially, Lehnberg had hoped that she and Susanna van der Linde could come to some sort of arrangement concerning Christiaan, but this meeting was to change all of those ideas. Not only did Susanna van der Linde tell Lehnberg that she would never give her husband a divorce because of the children, she also added, she ''didn\u2019t mind playing second fiddle'' as long as Lehnberg didn't mind either. It was obvious to Lehnberg that Susanna van der Linde was prepared to do anything to keep her husband.\n\n==Run-up to the murder==\nIt was around this time that Lehnberg met Marthinus Charles Choegoe, who had lost a leg in a motorcar accident. He had come to the Orthopaedic Workshop to have an [[artificial limb]] fitted.  He was unemployed and his disabilities, both physical and social, had destroyed his self-esteem. This may have made him particularly susceptible to Lehnberg's approaches.\n\nLehnberg first contacted Choegoe by letter, which she wrote to him care of Solly's Trading Store, his local shop.  In the letter she asked him to come and see her at the Orthopaedic Workshop, adding that if he was clever he could still earn good money. When he arrived at the workshop Lehnberg gave him R1.00 and asked him to meet her at the [[Rondebosch]] [[town hall]] at 7 p.m. that evening, at which time she gave him a bottle of [[gin]] and said that she wanted him to murder a woman for her. Choegoe declined at first, saying that he was afraid of being sent to the [[gallows]]. \n\nAfter some discussion Choegoe finally agreed to Lehnberg's request.  Several days later he went to the address in [[Boston, Bellville]] which Lehnberg had given him, later claiming that he planned to warn Susanna van der Linde that her life was in danger. But instead of warning Susanna van der Linde of Lehnberg's plans, he simply asked her for some money. She said she didn't have any and went back inside the house.\n\nA week later Choegoe and Lehnberg met in [[Rondebosch]] once more.  This time he admitted that he was too afraid to go through with the murder. Lehnberg gave him a radio and promised that she would help him to receive an artificial limb if he did away with Susanna van der Linde. Choegoe went to Bellville again but on this occasion he simply walked past the house and made no attempt to enter.\n\nShortly afterward Lehnberg sent Choegoe a second letter, again urging him to go through with the murder, using a knife if he had to. She got another message to him, asking him to telephone her at work. During the subsequent conversation Lehnberg insisted that Choegoe go through with the murder.  She promised to give him a car and have sex with him after the crime had been committed.\n\n==Murder==\nIn October 1974 Lehnberg handed in her notice at the hospital and told van der Linde that she was going to leave Cape Town. On 24 October Lehnberg collected Choegoe from his home in [[Retreat, Cape Town|Retreat]] and drove him to Bellville in her car. He was armed with a hammer which was to be used to kill Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg dropped him off in the vicinity of Boston and sped away. Shortly afterward Choegoe was spotted by Susanna van der Linde. She was alarmed because she had seen him in the area on more than one occasion. She telephoned the Bellville Police Station and Choegoe was picked up by the police about two blocks from her house. At the [[police station]] he was beaten and warned not to return to the area.\n\nIn the face of repeated failure Lehnberg decided to take matters into her own hands again. A few days after Choegoe's failed attempt, she approached Rob Newman, a 24-year old engineering student whom she knew, and asked to borrow his [[Llama firearms|Llama]] [[pistol]].  When he refused she asked if he would kill someone for her. Again he refused but on 28 October Newman's pistol was stolen from his room. He reported the theft to the police and suggested Lehnberg as a likely suspect.\n\nAround 8.30 a.m. on the morning of Monday 4 November 1974 Lehnberg arrived at Choegoe's home.  She said that her car was packed and she was on her way to [[Johannesburg]], but before she left she needed Choegoe to come with her to van der Linde's house.  He claimed in a statement that it wasn't until she handed him the Llama pistol on the way to Bellville that he realized that she wasn't just going to say goodbye.\n\nThey arrived outside the house just after 9 a.m. Susanna van der Linde was alone inside.  From this point on Choegoe's and Lehnberg's account of what followed differ. \n\n===Different accounts===\nLehnberg claimed that she got out of the car, rang the doorbell and returned to the car while Choegoe entered the house alone and committed the murder. Choegoe, however, maintained that they acted together throughout. Choegoe's account was supported by a neighbour of the van der Linde's, Mrs. Marais.  On the morning in question, Marais had walked past Lehnberg's white [[Ford Anglia]] twice in the space of ten or twelve minutes while it was parked opposite the van der Linde house and on both occasions the car was empty.\n\nChoegoe said that after Lehnberg rang the bell they went into the house together. When Susanna van der Linde saw them both she became frightened and threatened to phone the police. She attempted to get away, but was tripped by Lehnberg, fell and hit her head on the door. While Susanna van der Linde was on the floor Lehnberg struck her on the jaw with the butt of the pistol. On Lehnberg's instructions Choegoe began to throttle the semi-conscious Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg then gave him a pair of scissors she had taken from the [[sideboard]]. Choegoe said he remembered stabbing Susanna van der Linde three times but the [[pathologist]] later noted seven stab wounds, six of which had penetrated the chest.\n\nAfter the murder Lehnberg squirted green dye over Choegoe using a gas pistol belonging to Susanna van der Linde.  After warning Choegoe that she would deny any involvement in the murder if he went to the police, Lehnberg took him home. She set off for Johannesburg, collecting two speeding tickets at [[Beaufort West]] on the journey\n\nWhen the police brought van der Linde home to identify his wife he casually turned the body with his foot and said that it was his wife. This was reported at the time by the police officers present as appearing callous and almost as if he had been expecting it. \n\nIt was suggested at the time that van der Linde had influenced Lehnberg in order to get her to murder his wife but this was not proven and he was never charged.\n\n===Arrest===\nChoegoe kept both of the pistols that were used at the scene of the crime which were later seized by police. When he was asked why he hadn't discarded them he replied that it was dangerous to throw pistols away.\n\nSusanna van der Linde's body was discovered at about 1 p.m. by her daughter.  van der Linde attempted to telephone his wife a number of times that morning and eventually became concerned when there was no reply. He spoke to his daughter Zelda, who worked at [[Tygerberg Hospital]], and asked her to go home during her lunch break to see if there was anything wrong.  When she arrived home the house was locked up, but through a window she caught a glimpse of her mother lying on the floor in the living room.\n\nThe police immediately began an intensive [[murder investigation]].  Their chief suspect was \"a crippled [[Cape Malay|coloured]] man\" who had been seen in the area on at least two occasions prior to the murder.  In fact, it was because of Choegoe that Susanna van der Linde insisted that her husband buy her a dye pistol. At first nobody considered that Lehnberg was involved or that she may have hired an [[assassination|assassin]].\n\nFor the next week police efforts to establish Choegoe's identity and whereabouts proved fruitless. But at around 7.30 a.m. on 13 November a breakthrough occurred. Lieutenant Roland Fourie of the [[Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad]] in Johannesburg went to see Lehnberg, who was staying at her uncle's house in [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and asked her to accompany him to [[Brixton, Gauteng|Brixton]] Police Station where he wished to ask her some questions.  Lehnberg admitted on the way to the police station that van der Linde was her lover. She added that she had been expecting the police to contact her ever since she first heard about the murder of Susanna van der Linde from her mother.\n\nWhen asked if she had an association with \"a [[Cape Malay|coloured]] man named Marthinus\" she denied the allegation. Fourie also asked her if she had once requested a Robert Newman to give her his pistol so that she could get rid of Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg admitted that she had, but that the request had been made in fun. Although Fourie had no specific evidence to tie Lehnberg to the murder it did strike him that she seemed unnaturally nervous at times during the interview.\n\nWhile Fourie was on the telephone to Cape Town another detective, Major van Aswegen, began asking Lehnberg questions. She suddenly blurted out that she took Choegoe to the van der Linde house, waited for him outside and took him home afterwards.\n\nLehnberg was arrested and formally charged with the murder of Susanna van der Linde.  Later that day she made a full statement in which she admitted that she had asked Choegoe, if he would ''do away'' with Susanna van der Linde.  In the statement she claimed that she had waited in the car while her accomplice had committed the crime. Choegoe was arrested the same day.\n\nThe trial of Lehnberg and Choegoe began at the [[Cape Supreme Court|Cape Town Supreme Court]] on 5 March 1975.  The trial drew hundreds of spectators who fought for seats in the packed courtroom.  After a hearing which lasted seven days, during which the State called more than 30 witnesses, the Judge, Justice Diemont and his two assessors, A.J. van Niekerk and F. van Zyl Smith, deliberated overnight and returned verdicts of guilty for both accused.  The court found no [[extenuating circumstances]] and Lehnberg and Choegoe were sentenced to death.\n\n==Appeal and imprisonment==\nTwo months later, the case was re-opened on appeal. In July 1975, the death sentences were set aside. Lehnberg was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Choegoe to 15 years.<ref>[http://www.legalcity.net/Index.cfm?fuseaction=RIGHTS.article&Index=A&ArticleID=6400430&Page=3 Case History - The belated psychiatrists]</ref>\nChoegoe, however, was released in June 1986 and became an [[evangelism|evangelical preacher]], while Lehnberg was paroled in December of the same year.\n\nLehnberg ended her life in October 2015, five days before her 60th birthday.  She had suffered from [[osteoporosis]] for years and had also been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]].  She could no longer take the severe pain she was in and committed suicide alone at home, and in relative obscurity.  Choegoe died in a car accident in 1992 on the N7 near Nuwerus in the Western Cape. \n\nThe third member of the tragic triangle, Christiaan van der Linde, died a lonely man in 1983. After the trial, he moved to [[Krugersdorp]] so that he could visit his wife's grave on her family's farm in the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains every day.  He expressed remorse of ever having met Marlene Lehnberg.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the trial a law known as the \"Marlene Lehnberg Clause\" was passed in South Africa, preventing convicted criminals from profiting from their crimes, since it was believed that Lehnberg planned to sell her story to the press for a large sum of money.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20040814103116258C437872  Charmaine Phillips eager to be released] - similar crime where Clause applies </ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bennett, Benjamin.

When she arrived home the house was locked up, but through a window she caught a glimpse of her mother lying on the floor in the living room.\n\nThe police immediately began an intensive [[murder investigation]].  Their chief suspect was \"a crippled [[Cape Malay|coloured]] man\" who had been seen in the area on at least two occasions prior to the murder.  In fact, it was because of Choegoe that Susanna van der Linde insisted that her husband buy her a dye pistol. At first nobody considered that Lehnberg was involved or that she may have hired an [[assassination|assassin]].\n\nFor the next week police efforts to establish Choegoe's identity and whereabouts proved fruitless. But at around 7.30 a.m. on 13 November a breakthrough occurred. Lieutenant Roland Fourie of the [[Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad]] in Johannesburg went to see Lehnberg, who was staying at her uncle's house in [[Bryanston, Gauteng|Bryanston]] and asked her to accompany him to [[Brixton, Gauteng|Brixton]] Police Station where he wished to ask her some questions.  Lehnberg admitted on the way to the police station that van der Linde was her lover. She added that she had been expecting the police to contact her ever since she first heard about the murder of Susanna van der Linde from her mother.\n\nWhen asked if she had an association with \"a [[Cape Malay|coloured]] man named Marthinus\" she denied the allegation. Fourie also asked her if she had once requested a Robert Newman to give her his pistol so that she could get rid of Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg admitted that she had, but that the request had been made in fun. Although Fourie had no specific evidence to tie Lehnberg to the murder it did strike him that she seemed unnaturally nervous at times during the interview.\n\nWhile Fourie was on the telephone to Cape Town another detective, Major van Aswegen, began asking Lehnberg questions. She suddenly blurted out that she took Choegoe to the van der Linde house, waited for him outside and took him home afterwards.\n\nLehnberg was arrested and formally charged with the murder of Susanna van der Linde.  Later that day she made a full statement in which she admitted that she had asked Choegoe, if he would ''do away'' with Susanna van der Linde.  In the statement she claimed that she had waited in the car while her accomplice had committed the crime. Choegoe was arrested the same day.\n\nThe trial of Lehnberg and Choegoe began at the [[Cape Supreme Court|Cape Town Supreme Court]] on 5 March 1975.  The trial drew hundreds of spectators who fought for seats in the packed courtroom.  After a hearing which lasted seven days, during which the State called more than 30 witnesses, the Judge, Justice Diemont and his two assessors, A.J. van Niekerk and F. van Zyl Smith, deliberated overnight and returned verdicts of guilty for both accused.  The court found no [[extenuating circumstances]] and Lehnberg and Choegoe were sentenced to death.\n\n==Appeal and imprisonment==\nTwo months later, the case was re-opened on appeal. In July 1975, the death sentences were set aside. Lehnberg was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Choegoe to 15 years.<ref>[http://www.legalcity.net/Index.cfm?fuseaction=RIGHTS.article&Index=A&ArticleID=6400430&Page=3 Case History - The belated psychiatrists]</ref>\nChoegoe, however, was released in June 1986 and became an [[evangelism|evangelical preacher]], while Lehnberg was paroled in December of the same year.\n\nLehnberg ended her life in October 2015, five days before her 60th birthday.  She had suffered from [[osteoporosis]] for years and had also been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]].  She could no longer take the severe pain she was in and committed suicide alone at home, and in relative obscurity.  Choegoe died in a car accident in 1992 on the N7 near Nuwerus in the Western Cape. \n\nThe third member of the tragic triangle, Christiaan van der Linde, died a lonely man in 1983. After the trial, he moved to [[Krugersdorp]] so that he could visit his wife's grave on her family's farm in the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains every day.  He expressed remorse of ever having met Marlene Lehnberg.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the trial a law known as the \"Marlene Lehnberg Clause\" was passed in South Africa, preventing convicted criminals from profiting from their crimes, since it was believed that Lehnberg planned to sell her story to the press for a large sum of money.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20040814103116258C437872  Charmaine Phillips eager to be released] - similar crime where Clause applies </ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bennett, Benjamin.

part of [[Sichuan]] province, China, located at the junction of the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]] and [[Yangtze River]]s. Its population was 4,471,840 inhabitants according to the 2010 census of whom 836,340 lived in the built-up area made of Cuiping District.\n\n==History==\nHuman habitation of Yibin dates back at least 4,000 years. Yibin was established as a county in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2212 AD 220). Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], the town and its hinterland was known as '''Xuzhou''' [[fu (administrative subdivision)|Commandery]] {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6558\u5dde|\u5e9c}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u53d9\u5dde|\u5e9c}}}},}} <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>{{nbsp}}''X\u00f9zh\u014duf\u01d4''), which was variously romanized as '''Suifu''', '''Suifoo''',{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and '''Suchow'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} Its population around 1907 was estimated at 50,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Yibin Yangtze Begins Here.jpg|thumb|left|The Yangtze at the confluence of the Min and [[Jinsha River|Jinsha]] Rivers.  Below Yibin, the Yangtze is known in Chinese as ''Chang Jiang'' or the \"Long River\".  Above Yibin, the Yangtze is known as the Jinsha or Gold Sands River.]]\n\nYibin is located in the southeast portion of Sichuan at the southern end of the [[Sichuan Basin]], bordering [[Zhaotong]] ([[Yunnan]]) to the south, [[Luzhou]] to the east, [[Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture]] and [[Leshan]] to the west, and [[Zigong]] to the north, and has a total area is {{convert|13283|sqkm|0}}. The city ranges in latitude from 27\u00b0 50'\u221229\u00b0 16' N, and in longitude from 103\u00b0 36'\u2212105\u00b0 20' E, stretching {{convert|153|km|abbr=on}} east-west and {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} north-south.\n\nThe city is located at the confluence of the Min and Yangtze Rivers.  Above Yibin, the Yangtze is also known as the [[Jinsha River]].  Below Yibin, the Yangtze is known in Chinese as the ''Chang Jiang'' or \"Long River.\"\n\nAs with the rest of the Sichuan Basin, Yibin has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa'') with high humidity year-round; winters are short and mild while summers long, hot, and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|7.9|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|26.9|\u00b0C|1}} in July and August; the annual mean is {{convert|18.03|\u00b0C|1}}. Despite its location in the Yangtze River valley, it is still {{convert|1.5|to|2.0|C-change|F-change}} cooler than [[Chongqing]], located further downstream, in its warmest months. Frost is uncommon and the frost-free period lasts 347 days.<ref name=\"Weather China\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101271101.shtml? |script-title=zh:\u5b9c\u5bbe - \u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e -\u4e2d\u56fd\u5929\u6c14\u7f51|website=Weather China}}</ref> Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months.

It also produces paper, silk, and leather products. The surrounding region is rich in agricultural resources, growing rice, barley, oil seeds, sesame, and tea.\n\nThe largest employer in Yibin is [[Wuliangye Yibin|Wuliangye]], a company best known for Wuliangye, a brand of [[sorghum]]-based [[distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] known as [[baijiu]]. The Wuliangye Group grew from a small company employing just 300 people in 1977 into a large company employing over 20,000 on a seven square kilometer plant.  According to an August 2005 article in a securities weekly, the Wuliangye Group is 72% state owned and provides 70% of the revenues of Yibin City, a major regional center at the head of the Yangtze in southeastern Sichuan. In 2004 6,225 retired military worked for the company, out of a total work force of over 20,000. One third of top management positions are held by retired members of the military.<ref>[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/gb/defence/2004/07/29/20040729017053.html \"An Army of Production Out of Uniform: Retired Soldiers at Wuliangye\", PLA Daily July 29, 2004]</ref> Unsuccessful efforts to diversify its business, poor transparency and a murky ownership pictures are among the company's problems today.<ref>[http://cn.biz.yahoo.com/050822/133/c43m.html \"Stockholder Interests Poorly Represented, This is How Profits Slip Away,\" ''Bond Market Weekly'', August 22, 2005]</ref>  However, liquor is not the sole product of the WuLiangye Group. It also provides the specialized high-tech anti-counterfeit packaging and printing business and engineering services. Wuliangye now contributes about 60% of Yibin's GDP.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe region's natural waterways provide transportation links with the surrounding area, and Yibin is also connected to [[Chongqing]] and [[Chengdu]] by rail and express highway. Yibin's proximity to the Yunnan and Guizhou borders also means that transportation to the provinces is available by rail and by bus.\n\nYibin has three [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels#From Shanghai to Yibin: Chang Jiang|bridges over the ''Chang Jiang'' section of the Yangtze]] and ten [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels#From Yibin to Yushu: The Jinsha|bridges over the Jinsha]].\n\n[[Yibin Airport]] offers flights to [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Guiyang]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Lhasa]], [[Sanya]], [[Shanghai]],  [[Shenzhen]], [[Xi'an]], and [[Yichang]].\n\n==Tourism==\nThere are several hot springs near Yibin, plus many other tourist attractions. Such attractions include the Bamboo Sea in Changning County and the Xingwen Stone Forest. Cuiping mountain in the centre of the city provides wonderful views of Yibin. Yibin is also the confluence of the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]] and [[Jinsha River]]s, which together form the ''Chang Jiang'' as the [[Yangtze River]] is known in Chinese from Yibin to Shanghai.\n\nThe most significant scenic resource is Cuiping Mountain Park (Cuipingshan gongyuan,\u7fe0\u5c4f\u5c71\u516c\u56ed), which stretches for hundreds of kilometers.\n\n==Yibin in

Its population was 4,471,840 inhabitants according to the 2010 census of whom 836,340 lived in the built-up area made of Cuiping District.\n\n==History==\nHuman habitation of Yibin dates back at least 4,000 years. Yibin was established as a county in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2212 AD 220). Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], the town and its hinterland was known as '''Xuzhou''' [[fu (administrative subdivision)|Commandery]] {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6558\u5dde|\u5e9c}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u53d9\u5dde|\u5e9c}}}},}} <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small>{{nbsp}}''X\u00f9zh\u014duf\u01d4''), which was variously romanized as '''Suifu''', '''Suifoo''',{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and '''Suchow'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1887}} Its population around 1907 was estimated at 50,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Yibin Yangtze Begins Here.jpg|thumb|left|The Yangtze at the confluence of the Min and [[Jinsha River|Jinsha]] Rivers.

It also produces paper, silk, and leather products. The surrounding region is rich in agricultural resources, growing rice, barley, oil seeds, sesame, and tea.\n\nThe largest employer in Yibin is [[Wuliangye Yibin|Wuliangye]], a company best known for Wuliangye, a brand of [[sorghum]]-based [[distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] known as [[baijiu]]. The Wuliangye Group grew from a small company employing just 300 people in 1977 into a large company employing over 20,000 on a seven square kilometer plant.  According to an August 2005 article in a securities weekly, the Wuliangye Group is 72% state owned and provides 70% of the revenues of Yibin City, a major regional center at the head of the Yangtze in southeastern Sichuan. In 2004 6,225 retired military worked for the company, out of a total work force of over 20,000. One third of top management positions are held by retired members of the military.<ref>[http://www.chinamil.com.cn/gb/defence/2004/07/29/20040729017053.html \"An Army of Production Out of Uniform: Retired Soldiers at Wuliangye\", PLA Daily July 29, 2004]</ref> Unsuccessful efforts to diversify its business, poor transparency and a murky ownership pictures are among the company's problems today.<ref>[http://cn.biz.yahoo.com/050822/133/c43m.html \"Stockholder Interests Poorly Represented, This is How Profits Slip Away,\" ''Bond Market Weekly'', August 22, 2005]</ref>  However, liquor is not the sole product of the WuLiangye Group. It also provides the specialized high-tech anti-counterfeit packaging and printing business and engineering services. Wuliangye now contributes about 60% of Yibin's GDP.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe region's natural waterways provide transportation links with the surrounding area, and Yibin is also connected to [[Chongqing]] and [[Chengdu]] by rail and express highway. Yibin's proximity to the Yunnan and Guizhou borders also means that transportation to the provinces is available by rail and by bus.\n\nYibin has three [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels#From Shanghai to Yibin: Chang Jiang|bridges over the ''Chang Jiang'' section of the Yangtze]] and ten [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels#From Yibin to Yushu: The Jinsha|bridges over the Jinsha]].\n\n[[Yibin Airport]] offers flights to [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Guiyang]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Lhasa]], [[Sanya]], [[Shanghai]],  [[Shenzhen]], [[Xi'an]], and [[Yichang]].\n\n==Tourism==\nThere are several hot springs near Yibin, plus many other tourist attractions. Such attractions include the Bamboo Sea in Changning County and the Xingwen Stone Forest. Cuiping mountain in the centre of the city provides wonderful views of Yibin. Yibin is also the confluence of the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]] and [[Jinsha River]]s, which together form the ''Chang Jiang'' as the [[Yangtze River]] is known in Chinese from Yibin to Shanghai.\n\nThe most significant scenic resource is Cuiping Mountain Park (Cuipingshan gongyuan,\u7fe0\u5c4f\u5c71\u516c\u56ed), which stretches for hundreds of kilometers.\n\n==Yibin in Literature==\n* ''Dragonfly Eyes'' by [[Cao Wenxuan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2016-07/27/content_26237481.htm|title=Readers relishing Cao Wenxuan's latest novel {{!}.

The cylinder wall is a thin sleeve surrounding the piston head which creates a space for the combustion of fuel and the genesis of mechanical '''four-stroke''' (also '''four-cycle''') '''engine''' is an [[internal combustion]] (IC) engine in which the [[piston]] completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:\n#'''Intake''': Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston.\n#'''Compression''': This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C.  In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.\n#'''Combustion''': Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a [[spark plug]] (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.\n#'''Exhaust''': Also known as outlet. During the ''exhaust'' stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.\nThese four strokes can be remembered by the colloquial phrase, \"Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 0tto cycle ===\n{{main|Otto cycle}}\n{{see also|Otto engine}}\n[[File:PSM V18 D500 An american internal combustion otto engine.jpg|thumb|left|An Otto Engine from 1880's US Manufacture]]\n\n[[Nikolaus Otto|Nikolaus August Otto]] was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]].  In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18&nbsp;litre [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir#Lenoir engine|Lenoir Engine]] produced only 2&nbsp;horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by [[Philippe le Bon|Philip Lebon]].<ref name=\"NAMuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |title=125 Jahre Viertaktmotor |trans-title=125 Years of the Four Stroke Engine |website=Oldtimer Club Nicolaus August Otto e.V. |location=Germany |language=German |url-status=dead |year=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507083259/http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |archive-date=2011-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\n\nIn 1864, Otto and [[Eugen Langen]] founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\nThe factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to [[Deutz AG|Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG]] (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company).<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" /> In 1872, [[Gottlieb Daimler]] was technical director and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.\nBy 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.\n\nDaimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The [[Daimler Reitwagen|Daimler ''Reitwagen'']] used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle  powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design. The following year, [[Karl Benz]] produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.<ref>Ralph Stein (1967). The Automobile Book. Paul Hamlyn Ltd</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]. Today, that company is [[Daimler-Benz]].\n\n=== Atkinson cycle ===\n[[Image:Prius2004.JPG|thumb|230px|This 2004 [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid has an Atkinson-cycle engine as the petrol-electric hybrid engine]]\n[[Image:T cycle AtkinsonMiller.png|thumb|170px|The Atkinson Gas Cycle]]\n{{main|Atkinson cycle}}\n\nThe Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by [[James Atkinson (inventor)|James Atkinson]] in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of [[power density]], and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications.\n\nThe original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines.<ref name=pat367496>{{cite patent|country=US|number=367496|inventor=J. Atkinson|title=Gas Engine|gdate=1887-08-02}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unique [[crankshaft]] design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater [[thermal efficiency]] than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson's original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autos.ca/auto-tech/auto-tech-atkinson-cycle-engines-and-hybrids/ |title=Auto Tech: Atkinson Cycle engines and Hybrids |work=Autos.ca |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Diesel cycle===\n{{Main|Diesel cycle}}\n[[File:1 Audi R15.jpg|thumb|right|Audi Diesel R15 at Le Mans]]\n\nThe [[diesel engine]] is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto-cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, [[Rudolf Diesel]] wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The [[Etienne Lenoir|Lenoir]], Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on [[Coal gas|Illuminating Gas (coal gas)]]. With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.\n\nDuring initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.\n\nThe four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto-cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency.\n\n==Thermodynamic analysis==\n[[Image:diagrama pv de ciclo 4tempos.png|right|300px|thumb|The idealized four-stroke Otto cycle [[Pressure volume diagram|p-V diagram]]: the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">&nbsp;intake (A)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke is performed by an [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] expansion, followed by the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">&nbsp;compression (B)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke, performed by an [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression. Through the combustion of fuel an [[isochoric process]] is produced, followed by an adiabatic expansion, characterizing the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0001;\">&nbsp;power (C)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke. The cycle is closed by an isochoric process and an isobaric compression, characterizing the <span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">&nbsp;exhaust (D)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke.\n]]\n\nThe [[thermodynamic]] analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions<ref name=\"airstandard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.betp.net/2011/04/air-standard-assumptions/ |title=Best Place for Engineering and Technology, Air Standard Assumptions |url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.\n\nDuring normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non-compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%.\n\n==Fuel considerations==\nA problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.\n\nThe tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher [[Compression ratio]]s also means that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the [[Expansion ratio]]).\n\nThe octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.\n\nMany modern four-stroke engines employ [[gasoline direct injection]] or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.testingautos.com/car_care/four-stroke-engine.html |title= Four-stroke engine: how it works, animation| website= testingautos.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref> Employment of direct fuel injection significantly drops the peak temperature which is a function of both injection timing and quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-injection/ |title= Direct-Injection - an overview| website= sciencedirect.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDiesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold.  Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a [[glow plug]].\n\n==Design and engineering principles==\n\n=== Power output limitations ===\n[[Image:Ciclo del motore 4T.svg|right|250px|thumb|The four-stroke cycle\n<br>1=TDC\n<br>2=BDC\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">'''&nbsp;A: Intake&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">'''&nbsp;B: Compression&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0000;\">'''&nbsp;C: Power&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">'''&nbsp;D: Exhaust&nbsp;'''</span>\n]]\n\nThe maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a [[two-stroke engine]] or four-stroke design, [[volumetric efficiency]], losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and [[lubrication]]. Valves, pistons and [[connecting rod]]s suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and [[piston ring]] flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. [[Piston ring]] flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as '[[valve float]]', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10&nbsp;m/s.\n\n==== Intake/exhaust port flow ====\nThe output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air\u2013fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the [[cylinder head]]. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an [[air flow bench]], the radii of valve port turns and [[valve seat]] configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called [[cylinder head porting|porting]], and it can be done by hand or with a [[CNC]] machine.\n\n=== Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine ===\nAn internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If we could somehow recover the waste heat we can improve the engine's performance. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sprouse III|first=Charles|last2=Depcik|first2=Christopher|date=2013-03-01|title=Review of organic Rankine cycles for internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat recovery|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|volume=51|issue=1\u20132|pages=711\u2013722|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.10.017}}</ref>\n\nMany methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the [[Rankine cycle|Rankine Cycle]], [[turbocharging]] and [[Thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric generation]] can be very useful as a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] system.\n\nThough these systems are used more frequently some issues, like their low efficiency at lower heat supply rates and high pumping losses, remain a cause of concern. {{Citation needed|reason=The section is sourced to a single paper which, from the abstract, seems to be limited to the Rankine cycle. I have requested the full paper and upon review will either remove or update the template.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Supercharging ====\nOne way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a [[supercharger]], which can be powered by the engine crankshaft.\n\nSupercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.\n\n==== Turbocharging ====\nA [[turbocharger]] is a supercharger that is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, by means of a [[turbine]]. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow.\n\nWhen idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine.\n\nTurbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as [[turbo lag]]. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.\n\n=== Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio ===\nThe rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the [[connecting rod]] to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight.\n\nA \"square engine\" is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an [[oversquare]] engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.\n\n=== Valve train ===\nThe valves are typically operated by a [[camshaft]] rotating at half the speed of the [[crankshaft]]. It has a series of [[cam]]s along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A [[tappet]] between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts \u201cabove\u201d a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the [[crankcase]], in which case each cam usually contacts a [[push rod]], which contacts a [[rocker arm]] that opens a valve, or in case of a [[flathead engine]] a push rod is not necessary. The [[overhead cam]] design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.\n\n==== Valve clearance ====\nValve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, this results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each {{convert|20000|mi|km}} with a feeler gauge.\n\nMost modern production engines use  [[hydraulic lifters]] to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure.\n\n===Energy balance===\nOtto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories.<ref name=\"OtoE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecen.com/content/eee7/motoref.htm |title=Efficiencies of Internal Combustion Engines |first=Omar Campos |last=Ferreira |work=Economia & Energia |location=Brasil |language=Portuguese |date=March 1998 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed  back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the [[turbosteamer]], a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%.<ref name=\"BMWTS\">{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ |title=BMW Turbo Steamer Gets Hot and Goes |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog |date=2005-12-09 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> By contrast, a [[six-stroke engine]] may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.\n\nModern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for [[Vehicle emissions control|emission controls]] such as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and [[catalytic converter]]s that reduce [[smog]] and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an [[engine control unit]] using [[Lean-burn|lean burn techniques]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles: Standards and Technologies for Controlling Emissions |first1=Asif |last1=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of {{convert|34.9|mpgus|abbr=on|1}} compared to the current standard of {{convert|25|mpgus|abbr=on|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy|title=Fuel Economy |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|location=US|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref> As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) have to be considered.

The cylinder wall is a thin sleeve surrounding the piston head which creates a space for the combustion of fuel and the genesis of mechanical '''four-stroke''' (also '''four-cycle''') '''engine''' is an [[internal combustion]] (IC) engine in which the [[piston]] completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:\n#'''Intake''': Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston.\n#'''Compression''': This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C.  In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.\n#'''Combustion''': Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a [[spark plug]] (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.\n#'''Exhaust''': Also known as outlet. During the ''exhaust'' stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.\nThese four strokes can be remembered by the colloquial phrase, \"Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Otto cycle ===\n{{main|Otto cycle}}\n{{see also|Otto engine}}\n[[File:PSM V18 D500 An american internal combustion otto engine.jpg|thumb|left|An Otto Engine from 1880's US Manufacture]]\n\n[[Nikolaus Otto|Nikolaus August Otto]] was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]].  In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18&nbsp;litre [[\u00c9tienne Lenoir#Lenoir engine|Lenoir Engine]] produced only 2&nbsp;horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by [[Philippe le Bon|Philip Lebon]].<ref name=\"NAMuseum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |title=125 Jahre Viertaktmotor |trans-title=125 Years of the Four Stroke Engine |website=Oldtimer Club Nicolaus August Otto e.V. |location=Germany |language=German |url-status=dead |year=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507083259/http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/node/15 |archive-date=2011-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\n\nIn 1864, Otto and [[Eugen Langen]] founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" />\nThe factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to [[Deutz AG|Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG]] (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company).<ref name=\"NAMuseum\" /> In 1872, [[Gottlieb Daimler]] was technical director and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.\nBy 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.\n\nDaimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The [[Daimler Reitwagen|Daimler ''Reitwagen'']] used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle  powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design. The following year, [[Karl Benz]] produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.<ref>Ralph Stein (1967). The Automobile Book. Paul Hamlyn Ltd</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]]. Today, that company is [[Daimler-Benz]].\n\n=== Atkinson cycle ===\n[[Image:Prius2004.JPG|thumb|230px|This 2004 [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid has an Atkinson-cycle engine as the petrol-electric hybrid engine]]\n[[Image:T cycle AtkinsonMiller.png|thumb|170px|The Atkinson Gas Cycle]]\n{{main|Atkinson cycle}}\n\nThe Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by [[James Atkinson (inventor)|James Atkinson]] in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of [[power density]], and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications.\n\nThe original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines.<ref name=pat367496>{{cite patent|country=US|number=367496|inventor=J. Atkinson|title=Gas Engine|gdate=1887-08-02}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unique [[crankshaft]] design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater [[thermal efficiency]] than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson's original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autos.ca/auto-tech/auto-tech-atkinson-cycle-engines-and-hybrids/ |title=Auto Tech: Atkinson Cycle engines and Hybrids |work=Autos.ca |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Diesel cycle===\n{{Main|Diesel cycle}}\n[[File:1 Audi R15.jpg|thumb|right|Audi Diesel R15 at Le Mans]]\n\nThe [[diesel engine]] is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto-cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, [[Rudolf Diesel]] wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The [[Etienne Lenoir|Lenoir]], Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on [[Coal gas|Illuminating Gas (coal gas)]]. With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.\n\nDuring initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.\n\nThe four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto-cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency.\n\n==Thermodynamic analysis==\n[[Image:diagrama pv de ciclo 4tempos.png|right|300px|thumb|The idealized four-stroke Otto cycle [[Pressure volume diagram|p-V diagram]]: the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">&nbsp;intake (A)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke is performed by an [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] expansion, followed by the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">&nbsp;compression (B)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke, performed by an [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression. Through the combustion of fuel an [[isochoric process]] is produced, followed by an adiabatic expansion, characterizing the\n<span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0001;\">&nbsp;power (C)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke. The cycle is closed by an isochoric process and an isobaric compression, characterizing the <span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">&nbsp;exhaust (D)&nbsp;</span>\nstroke.\n]]\n\nThe [[thermodynamic]] analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions<ref name=\"airstandard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.betp.net/2011/04/air-standard-assumptions/ |title=Best Place for Engineering and Technology, Air Standard Assumptions |url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.\n\nDuring normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non-compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%.\n\n==Fuel considerations==\nA problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.\n\nThe tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher [[Compression ratio]]s also means that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the [[Expansion ratio]]).\n\nThe octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.\n\nMany modern four-stroke engines employ [[gasoline direct injection]] or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.testingautos.com/car_care/four-stroke-engine.html |title= Four-stroke engine: how it works, animation| website= testingautos.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref> Employment of direct fuel injection significantly drops the peak temperature which is a function of both injection timing and quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/direct-injection/ |title= Direct-Injection - an overview| website= sciencedirect.com|  accessdate= January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDiesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold.  Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a [[glow plug]].\n\n==Design and engineering principles==\n\n=== Power output limitations ===\n[[Image:Ciclo del motore 4T.svg|right|250px|thumb|The four-stroke cycle\n<br>1=TDC\n<br>2=BDC\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #10ff00;\">'''&nbsp;A: Intake&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ffae21;\">'''&nbsp;B: Compression&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #ff0000;\">'''&nbsp;C: Power&nbsp;'''</span>\n<br><span style=\"margin:1px; background-color: #639eff;\">'''&nbsp;D: Exhaust&nbsp;'''</span>\n]]\n\nThe maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a [[two-stroke engine]] or four-stroke design, [[volumetric efficiency]], losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and [[lubrication]]. Valves, pistons and [[connecting rod]]s suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and [[piston ring]] flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. [[Piston ring]] flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as '[[valve float]]', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10&nbsp;m/s.\n\n==== Intake/exhaust port flow ====\nThe output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air\u2013fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the [[cylinder head]]. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an [[air flow bench]], the radii of valve port turns and [[valve seat]] configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called [[cylinder head porting|porting]], and it can be done by hand or with a [[CNC]] machine.\n\n=== Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine ===\nAn internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If we could somehow recover the waste heat we can improve the engine's performance. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sprouse III|first=Charles|last2=Depcik|first2=Christopher|date=2013-03-01|title=Review of organic Rankine cycles for internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat recovery|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|volume=51|issue=1\u20132|pages=711\u2013722|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.10.017}}</ref>\n\nMany methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the [[Rankine cycle|Rankine Cycle]], [[turbocharging]] and [[Thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric generation]] can be very useful as a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] system.\n\nThough these systems are used more frequently some issues, like their low efficiency at lower heat supply rates and high pumping losses, remain a cause of concern. {{Citation needed|reason=The section is sourced to a single paper which, from the abstract, seems to be limited to the Rankine cycle. I have requested the full paper and upon review will either remove or update the template.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Supercharging ====\nOne way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a [[supercharger]], which can be powered by the engine crankshaft.\n\nSupercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.\n\n==== Turbocharging ====\nA [[turbocharger]] is a supercharger that is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, by means of a [[turbine]]. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow.\n\nWhen idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine.\n\nTurbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as [[turbo lag]]. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.\n\n=== Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio ===\nThe rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the [[connecting rod]] to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight.\n\nA \"square engine\" is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an [[oversquare]] engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.\n\n=== Valve train ===\nThe valves are typically operated by a [[camshaft]] rotating at half the speed of the [[crankshaft]]. It has a series of [[cam]]s along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A [[tappet]] between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts \u201cabove\u201d a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the [[crankcase]], in which case each cam usually contacts a [[push rod]], which contacts a [[rocker arm]] that opens a valve, or in case of a [[flathead engine]] a push rod is not necessary. The [[overhead cam]] design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.\n\n==== Valve clearance ====\nValve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, this results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each {{convert|20000|mi|km}} with a feeler gauge.\n\nMost modern production engines use  [[hydraulic lifters]] to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure.\n\n===Energy balance===\nOtto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories.<ref name=\"OtoE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecen.com/content/eee7/motoref.htm |title=Efficiencies of Internal Combustion Engines |first=Omar Campos |last=Ferreira |work=Economia & Energia |location=Brasil |language=Portuguese |date=March 1998 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed  back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the [[turbosteamer]], a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%.<ref name=\"BMWTS\">{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ |title=BMW Turbo Steamer Gets Hot and Goes |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog |date=2005-12-09 |access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> By contrast, a [[six-stroke engine]] may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.\n\nModern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for [[Vehicle emissions control|emission controls]] such as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and [[catalytic converter]]s that reduce [[smog]] and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an [[engine control unit]] using [[Lean-burn|lean burn techniques]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles: Standards and Technologies for Controlling Emissions |first1=Asif |last1=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of {{convert|34.9|mpgus|abbr=on|1}} compared to the current standard of {{convert|25|mpgus|abbr=on|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy|title=Fuel Economy |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|location=US|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref> As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) have to be considered.

Whereas Zool attacks with projectiles, Zooz is armed with a [[energy]] [[whip]] for [[close quarters combat]], along with the ability of shooting projectiles as well. In addition, each character is capable of destroying certain parts of the scenery that the other one could not, and vice versa, resulting in a slightly different route through the levels. As with the original game, the sequel features several [[minigame]]s, such as a version of ''[[Breakout clone|Breakout]]'' which involves using Zoon, the two-headed morphing pet [[dog]] of Zool and Zooz, as a paddle in order to keep the ball in play by bouncing it upwards. The progression system acts similarly to the original game, which involves the player in collecting a set number of items in order to advance into the next level. The game also features a two-player mode.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Zool 2'' takes place several months after the events occurred in ''Zool''.<ref name=\"Z2manual\"/> Krool, the main [[antagonist]] of the original game has sent his forces and Mental Block, his [[shapeshifting]] henchman to invade the Nth [[Dimension]] and seize power in order to stifle the imagination of the world, causing rampant boredom in the process. Zool, the [[Protagonist|main protagonist]] of the first game, alongside his companion Zooz and their two-headed mascot Zoon, are entrusted with the mission of restoring order to the dimension and defeat Mental Block.<ref name=\"Z2manual\"/> After traversing through multiple locations, the trio reaches the main area where Mental Block resides and they defeat him, saving the dimension as a result, with a hint at a possible further sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmuseum.com/end/jaguar/a/zool2.htm|title=Ending for Zool 2 (Atari Jaguar)|website=vgmuseum.com|accessdate=2018-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610165327/http://www.vgmuseum.com/end/jaguar/a/zool2.htm|archive-date=2016-06-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|right|''Zool 2'' on the Amiga was conceived by a new team that previously worked on ''Harlequin'' for Gremlin Graphics.]]\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n''Zool 2'' was created by a new development team at The Warp Factory, whose programming staff involved personnel that previously worked on ''[[Harlequin (video game)|Harlequin]]'' for Gremlin Graphics, with only [[Video game composer|composer]] [[Patrick Phelan (composer)|Patrick Phelan]] returing from the original ''Zool'' as George Allan, Adrian Carless and Tony Dawson did not return to work on the sequel.<ref name=\"AA45\">{{cite magazine|last=Roundell|first=Paul|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_32446|title=Work in Progress - Zool 2|magazine=[[Amiga Action]]|issue=45|publisher=[[Europress]], [[International Data Group|IDG Media]]|date=June 1993|pages=47-49|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528021217/http://amr.abime.net/review_32446|archive-date=2015-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AA47\">{{cite magazine|last=Roundell|first=Paul|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_25569|title=Work in Progress - Zool 2 (Part 3)|magazine=[[Amiga Action]]|issue=47|publisher=[[Europress]], [[International Data Group|IDG Media]]|date=August 1993|pages=16-18|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528021023/http://amr.abime.net/review_25569|archive-date=2015-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AP31\">{{cite magazine|last=Winstanley|first=Mark|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_20380|title=Things to come - Zool 2|magazine=[[Amiga Power]]|issue=31|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=November 1993|page=31|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528021312/http://amr.abime.net/review_20380|archive-date=2015-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AC68\">{{cite magazine|last=Maddock|first=Jonathan|url=https://archive.org/stream/amiga-computing-magazine-068#page/n145/mode/2up|title=On the Drawingboard - Zool 2|magazine=[[Amiga Computing]]|issue=68|publisher=[[Europress]], [[International Data Group|IDG Media]]|date=Christmas 1993|pages=146-147}}</ref> Gremlin [[marketing manager]] Nick Clarkson stated that they wanted to expand upon Zool's character and gameplay for the sequel, while [[Video game producer|producer]] Peter J.

It was written and composed by [[Andre Harris]] and [[Marsha Ambrosius]], and produced by Jackson and Harris. The track appears on Jackson's tenth studio album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' (2001), and is Jackson's final single from a studio album. The song also appeared in \"[[The Ultimate Collection (Michael Jackson album)|The Ultimate Collection]]\" (2004). \"Butterflies\" is a [[tempo|midtempo]] ballad. The single received generally positive reviews from music critics; some music reviewers described the song as being one of the best songs on ''Invincible'' while others felt that it was a \"decent track\".\n\nThe song was only released in the United States to radio airplay. It peaked at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also charting at number two and thirty-six, respectively, on alternative ''Billboard'' charts in 2001 and 2002. There was no music video released for the song.\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Butterflies\" was recorded by [[Michael Jackson]] in 2001 for his tenth studio album, ''Invincible'', which was released the same year.<ref name=\"linernotes\">''Invincible'' liner notes [[Epic Records]] (2001)</ref> The song was written by Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is one half of the London bred [[neo-soul]] act Floetry,<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> and was produced by Jackson and Harris.<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who is also a member of [[Floetry]], through John McClain, who is [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]'s senior urban executive and Jackson's manager.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> She recalled in an interview with [[LAUNCH Media|''LAUNCH'' magazine]], \"It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? Is this what you were looking for? He was so open\".<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/>\n\nWhen Ambrosius first met Jackson, it took a few minutes to calm down.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> She recalled to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, \"To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend.\"<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> Harris commented on the single, \"He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did '[[Billie Jean]]' and '[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock With You]]' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines.\"<ref name=\"theatlanitcjournal\">{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F0F007E21514E96&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=With a new album, a popular single, and in demand as a hot commodity on television, Michael Jackson proves he's still....

It was written and composed by [[Andre Harris]] and [[Marsha Ambrosius]], and produced by Jackson and Harris. The track appears on Jackson's tenth studio album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' (2001), and is Jackson's final single from a studio album. The song also appeared in \"[[The Ultimate Collection (Michael Jackson album)|The Ultimate Collection]]\" (2004). \"Butterflies\" is a [[tempo|midtempo]] ballad. The single received generally positive reviews from music critics; some music reviewers described the song as being one of the best songs on ''Invincible'' while others felt that it was a \"decent track\".\n\nThe song was only released in the United States to radio airplay. It peaked at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also charting at number two and thirty-six, respectively, on alternative ''Billboard'' charts in 2001 and 2002. There was no music video released for the song.\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Butterflies\" was recorded by [[Michael Jackson]] in 2001 for his tenth studio album, ''Invincible'', which was released the same year.<ref name=\"linernotes\">''Invincible'' liner notes [[Epic Records]] (2001)</ref> The song was written by Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is one half of the London bred [[neo-soul]] act Floetry,<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> and was produced by Jackson and Harris.<ref name=\"linernotes\"/> Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who is also a member of [[Floetry]], through John McClain, who is [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]'s senior urban executive and Jackson's manager.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> She recalled in an interview with [[LAUNCH Media|''LAUNCH'' magazine]], \"It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? Is this what you were looking for? He was so open\".<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/>\n\nWhen Ambrosius first met Jackson, it took a few minutes to calm down.<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> She recalled to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, \"To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend.\"<ref name=\"yahoomusic\"/> Harris commented on the single, \"He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did '[[Billie Jean]]' and '[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock With You]]' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines.\"<ref name=\"theatlanitcjournal\">{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F0F007E21514E96&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=With a new album, a popular single, and in demand as a hot commodity on television, Michael Jackson proves he's still....
