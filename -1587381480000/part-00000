I do not conclude from this absence of evidence that the Phoenicians did not exist, nor that nobody ever called her- or himself a Phoenician under any circumstances: Phoenician-speakers undoubtedly had a larger repertoire of self-classifications than survives in our fragmentary evidence, and it would be surprising if, for instance, they never described themselves as Phoenicians to the Greeks who invented that term; indeed, I have drawn attention to several cases where something very close to that is going on... A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|pages=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter. Such modern ideas about the ancient Phoenicians are thoroughly interwoven with ideas about the modern nation-state. That does not in itself, of course, mean that they cannot also be true.

The Amarna Letters, an Egyptian record of diplomatic exchanges dated 1411-1358 B.C. reveal that neighboring Amorites and Hittites were capturing Phoenician vassals of Egypt between 1350 and 1300 B.C. The Late Bronze Age collapse severely weakened or destroyed numerous civilization in the region, including the Egyptians and Hittites. The Phoenicians, now free from foreign domination and interference, appeared to have weathered the crisis relatively well, emerging as a distinct and organized civilization around 1230 B.C.\n\nThe first textual account of the Phoenicians during the Iron Age comes from the Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser I, in relation to his campaign against the Phoenicians between 1114 and 1076 B.C.\n\n=== High point: 1200\u2013800 BC ===\n[[Fernand Braudel]] remarked that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires.

In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\n\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. [[Byblos]] first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111.

(Samples from other areas with significant Phoenician settlements, in Libya and southern France could not be included.) This deliberately sequential sampling represented an attempt to develop a methodology that could link the documented historical expansion of a population, with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns.

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the eighth century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]; the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornish tin]] was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Champion |first=Timothy |title=The appropriation of the Phoenicians in British imperial ideology |journal=Nations and Nationalism |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013465 |doi=10.1111/1469-8219.00027 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarshish]] ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the [[Land of Israel]] by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia. It was a place where Phoenicians reportedly obtained different metals, particularly silver, during the reign of Solomon. The [[Septuagint]], the Vulgate and the Targum of Jonathan render Tarshish as Carthage, but other biblical commentators read it as [[Tartessos]] perhaps in ancient {{lang|la|Hispania}} (Iberian Peninsula).

[[Hacksilver]] objects in these Phoenician hoards display lead isotope ratios that match ores in Sardinia and Spain.{{r|ThompsonSkaggs2013}} This metallic evidence agrees with the biblical memory of a western Mediterranean Tarshish that supplied Solomon with silver via Phoenicia. Assyrian records indicate Tarshish was an island, and the poetic construction of [[Psalm 72]] points to its identity as a large island in the west \u2014 the island of Sardinia.{{r|ThompsonSkaggs2013}}\n\nThe Phoenicians established commercial outposts throughout the Mediterranean, the most strategically important being [[Carthage]] in northwest Africa, southeast of Sardinia on the peninsula of present day Tunisia. Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called [[Fenius Farsa]]. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by [[Hanno the Navigator]] explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the [[Gulf of Guinea]]; Herodotus described a Phoenician expedition sent down the [[Red Sea]] by Egyptian pharaoh [[Necho II]] ({{circa|600&nbsp;BC}}) that [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] Africa and returned through the [[Pillars of Hercules]] after three years.\n\nIn the [[2nd millennium BC|2nd millennium B.C.]], the Phoenicians had a flourishing trade with Somali city-states in the Horn of Africa, particularly [[Mosylon]], [[Opone]], [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], [[Sarapion]], [[Mundus (city)|Mundus]] and [[Tabae]].\n\n=== Phoenician ships ===\nAs a predominately maritime people, the Phoenicians were among the earliest and most influential pioneers in shipbuilding and design. Naval historian [[Richard Woodman]] described them as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the inventors of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"\n\nAs early as 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. During the Bronze Age, they developed the [[keel]], the bottom-most longitudinal structural element on a ship, which was a significant advancement over the more common [[Dugout canoe|dugout]] vessels, which were limited in size, durability, maneuverability. Pegged [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joints were developed to make Phoenician ships sturdier, and proved effective enough to serve as a standard template across the Mediterranean until late into the Roman Empire.\n\nOther key ship components, such as the [[Brail|brailed rig sail]], which allowed for greater maneuverability, and the [[crow's nest]], which provided a vital lookout point, most likely originated in the Levant. Around 700 B.C., the Phoenicians were possibly the first to introduce the [[bireme]], a large war [[galley]] that had two banks of oars staggered on either side of the vessel, allowing for significantly greater propulsion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/galley-ship|title=Galley {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Carthaginians, who descended from the Phoenicians, had become a major power in the western Mediterranean largely because of their ability to efficient mass produce ships; parts were even labeled with the Punic alphabet.<ref>Piero Bartoloni, \u201cShips and Navigation,\u201d in The Phoenicians, ed. Sabatino Moscati (New York: Abbeville, 1988), p 76.</ref>\n\nIn addition to ships, the Phoenicians developed or contributed several other maritime inventions. the [[amphora]], a type of container used for both dry and liquid gods, was an ancient Phoenician invention that became a standardized measurement of volume for close to two thousand years. The remnants of sophisticated and self-cleaning artificial harbors have been discovered in Sidon, Tyre, Atlit, and Acre.<ref>Arad Haggi, \u201cReport on Underwater Excavation at the Phoenician Harbour, Atlit, Israel,\u201d International Journal of Nautical Archeology 39 (2010): 283.</ref> The Phoenicians relied on [[celestial navigation]], and most likely discovered Polaris (the North Star), which enabled nighttime sailing and shorter open-sea routes; the Greeks subsequently called Polaris the \"Phoenician Star.\" The wind rose, a precursor to the compass rose, was apparently of Phoenician, or at least Levantine, origin. The first example of [[admiralty law]] also appears in the Levant.<ref>Shelley Wachsmann, Seagoing Ships & Seamanship in the Bronze Age Levant (College Station, TX: Texas A & M University Press, 1998), 300, 51, 323-325, 332.</ref> The Phoenicians continued to contribute to cartography into the Iron Age.<ref>Mark Woolmer, Ancient Phoenicia: An Introduction (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2011), p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: {{lang|grc-Latn|Galloi}} (tubs) and {{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}} (horses). The names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, which were tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and had horse heads on both ends. (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that the ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]], equated with the Semitic-Levantine god [[Yam (god)|Yam]].\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship was found near [[Gozo]] island in Malta. Dated 700 BC, it is one of the oldest wrecks in the Mediterranean. The vessel was about 50 feet long and contained 50 amphorae full of wine and oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seeker.com/2700-year-old-phoenician-shipwreck-discovered-1769022411.html|title=2,700-Year-Old Phoenician Shipwreck Discovered|work=Seeker|date=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tel Balawat]] gates of an Assyrian palace (ninth century B.C.) located near Nimrud portrays ships coming to honor [[Shalmaneser III]].{{sfnp|Markoe|2000}}<ref>http://www.qsov.com/UK2006/718BM.JPG</ref> In another Assyrian palace, built for [[Sargon II]] and located in northern Iraq, the [[Khorsabad]] bas-relief (7th century B.C.) shows ships transporting timber, most likely cedar, from Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web |title=Assyria: Khorsabad (Room10c) |publisher=[[British Museum]] |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/middle_east/room_10c_assyria_khorsabad.aspx }}</ref>\n\n== Important cities and colonies ==\n{{main|List of Phoenician cities}}\n\nThe Phoenicians were not a nation in the political sense, but were organized into independent city-states that shared a common language and culture. The leading city states were Sur ([[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]), Sydon ([[Sidon]]), and Jbail (modern [[Byblos]], one of the oldest sites of civilization). Numerous others existed, including Berut (modern [[Beirut]]) Ampi, Amia, Arqa, [[Baalbek]], Botrys, Sarepta and [[Tripoli]]. From the late tenth century BC, the Phoenician's expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies beyond Lebanon and throughout the Mediterranean. Canaanite deities like [[Baal]] and [['Ashtart|Astarte]] were being worshiped from Cyprus and Sicily to Spain and Portugal, most notably at Carthage (''{{lang|phn|Qart Hada\u0161t}}'') in modern Tunisia.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = \n| width = 330\n| image1 = Griechischen und ph\u00f6nizischen Kolonien.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Carthage Holdings.png\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left, map of Phoenician (in yellow) and Greek colonies around 8th to 6th century BC (with German legend).

However, by the early Iron Age (roughly 1300 B.C.) the Phoenicians had emerged as a distinct people, with their culture, economy, and daily life being heavily centered on commerce and maritime trade. Their propensity for seafaring brought them into contact with numerous other civilizations, possibly more so than any other contemporary people, leading to a uniquely cosmopolitan society that incorporated different customs, artistic styles, and faith traditions.\n\n=== Political structure ===\nDespite a shared language, culture, and religion, the Phoenicians never constituted a single, cohesive political unit, and it is unknown whether they viewed themselves as a nation in the modern sense. The Phoenicians organized themselves along city-states that were fiercely independent in both domestic and foreign affairs. Formal alliances between city-states was rare, and cooperation was generally informal, loosely aligned, and ad hoc. Unlike their Greek counterparts, warfare between Phoenician city-states was rare, although rivalries did exist and coercion was sometimes employed. The relative power and influence of city-states varied over time. Sidon was dominant between the 12th and 11th centuries B.C., and exercise some influence over its neighbors, but by the tenth century B.C., Tyre rose to become the most powerful polity.\n\nPhoenician society was highly stratified and predominantly [[Monarchy|monarchical]]. Heredity kings usually governed with absolute power and had responsibilities over civic, commercial, and religious affairs. Rulers often relied upon senior officials derived from the noble and merchant classes. The priesthood was a distinct class, though usually of royal lineage or from leading merchant families. The king was considered a representative of the gods and carried many obligations and duties with respective to religious processions and rituals. Priests were thus highly influential and often became intertwined with the royal family.\n\nUnlike their Greek and Egyptian counterparts, Phoenician kings did not commemorate their reign through sculptures or monuments. Their wealth, power, and accomplishments were usually conveyed through ornate sarcophaguses, of which the most famous is [[Ahiram sarcophagus|Ahiram]] of Byblos. The Phoenicians kept fairly meticulous records of their rulers in the form of tomb inscriptions, which are among the few primary sources still available. Historians have been able to determine a clear line of succession spanning centuries for some city-states, notably Byblos and Tyre.\n\n==== Proto-democratic government ====\nNot all Phoenician city-states were governed as absolute monarchies. The long span of Phoenician history yielded various political changes and experiments. In the sixth century B.C., Tyre adopted a system of government consisting of a pair of judges known as ''suffetes,'' each chosen from the most powerful noble families and wielding absolute power. By the seventh century B.C., many city-states had circumscribed the power of their kings, who thereafter had to share power with largely independent sailors and traders, on whom the prosperity of the city-state heavily rested. Kings increasingly required the support of different stakeholders, and there is evidence that the councils and assemblies that had previously played an advisory role had accumulated some power over the state. The Greek historian [[Arrian]] reported that senior officials were sometimes called upon to govern when the king was predisposed, and accounts from other outsiders claimed that councils were the true rulers, such that they could impose their decisions on the king during emergencies.\n\nThere is some sparse evidence, mostly from Egyptian and Assyrian diplomatic records, that certain Phoenician city-states had constitutions and republican forms of government. As early as the fourteenth century B.C., Egyptian envoys reported that assemblies \"might act on their own behalf;\" when the city-state of Irqata declared its allegiance to the pharaoh, it did so as \"Irqata and its elders\" without reference to a king.<ref name=\":1\">Stephen Stockwell, Geopolitics, History, and International Relations , Vol. 2, No. 2 (2010), pp. 123- 135</ref> Similarly, the pharaoh is addressed by \"the citizens of Tunip,\" the \u201cpeople from Gubla (Byblos),\" and \"the men of Arwad.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In the fourth century B.C., when the armies of Alexander the Great approached Tyre, they were met not by a king but by \"representatives\" of the \"the commonwealth\" or the \"community.\" In a diplomatic exchange, it was \"the people\" of Tyre who passed a decree in response.\n\nIn light of these accounts, some scholars have argued that the Phoenicians had at least experimented with proto-democratic forms of government, possibly evening influencing the development of democracy in Athens.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Stephen Stockwell 2010\">Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): 123-133.</ref>\n\n=== Law and administration ===\nAfter the king and council, the two most important political positions in virtually every Phoenician city-state were that of governor and commander of the army. Details regarding the duties of these offices are sparse, but it is known that the governor was responsible for collecting taxes, implementing decrees, supervising judges, and ensuring the administration of law and justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> As warfare was rare among the mostly mercantile Phoenicians, the commander of the army was generally responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the city-state and its hintelands.\n\nThe Phoenicians had a system of courts and judges that resolved disputes and punished crimes based on a semi-codified body of law and traditional. Laws were implemented by the state and were the responsibility of the ruler and certain designated officials. In common with other Levantine societies, laws were harsh and biased, reflecting the social stratification of society. The murder of a commoner was treated as less serious than of a nobleman, and the upper classes had the most rights; the wealthy could often escape punishment by paying a fine. Free men could represent themselves in court and had more rights than women and children, while slaves had no rights at all. Men could often deflect punishment to their wives, children, or slaves, even having them serve his sentence in his place. Lawyers eventually emerged as a profession for those who could not plead their own case.\n\nAs in neighboring societies at the time, penalties for crimes were often severe, usually reflecting the principle of reciprocity; for example, the killing of a slave would be punished by having the offender's slave killed. Imprisonment was rare, with fines, exile, punishment, and execution were main remedies.\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Phoenician language|Phoenician alphabet|Alphabet}}\n\nThe Phoenician alphabet was one of the first (consonantal) alphabets with a strict and consistent form. It is assumed that it adopted its simplified linear characters from an as-yet unattested early pictorial [[Proto-Canaanite|Semitic alphabet]] developed some centuries earlier in the southern Levant.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1996}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Millard |first=A.

The Greeks adopted the majority of these letters but changed some of them to vowels which were significant in their language, giving rise to the first true alphabet.\n\nThe [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician language]] is classified in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] subgroup of Northwest [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. Its later descendant in [[northwest Africa]] is termed [[Punic language|Punic,]] which evolved in Phoenician colonies around the western Mediterranean, beginning in the 9th century BC. Punic Phoenician was still spoken in the 5th century AD; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who grew up in [[Northwest Africa]], was familiar with the language.\n\n=== Art ===\nPhoenician art was largely centered on ornamental objects, particularly jewelry, pottery, glassware, and reliefs.<ref name=\"Phoenician Art\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Phoenician_Art/|title=Phoenician Art|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> Large sculptures were rare, although figurines were more common, and while typically crude, depicted individualized features. Phoenician art generally lacked unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries; it was highly influenced by the many cultures the Phoenicians traded and interacted with, primarily [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece and [[Assyria]]. These influences were sometimes reflected in specific categories of art; Greek inspiration was particularly pronounced in pottery, while Egyptian styles were most reflected in ivory work.<ref name=\"Phoenician Art\"/> Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the [[Nile]] and the [[Euphrates]] gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/01/05/81740354.pdf|title=Phoenician Art|work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=1879-01-05}}</ref>\n\nAn 1879 article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Phoenician art thusly:\n\n{{bquote|He entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage.

McGovern, ''A NATION OF ARTISANS,'' Archaeology, Vol. 43, No. 2 (MARCH/APRIL 1990), p. 32. www.jstor.org/stable/41765806</ref> The second century historian [[Philo of Byblos]] noted that the Phoenician god of craftsmanship, Chousor, was also the inventor of the raft and the first sailor. There are Greek accounts describing the arrival of Phoenician traders bearing \"trinkets and baubles.\"<ref name=\":42\"/> The Phoenicians appeared to have used their knowledge of foreign artistic styles to craft goods that would specifically appeal to certain trading partners, distinguishing not only different cultures but even socioeconomic classes.<ref name=\":42\"/> This is also evidenced in the broad distribution of Phoenician goods, which have been found as west as Spain and Morocco, as north as Russia and as east as Iraq. In fact, much of what is known about Phoenician art is based from excavations outside of Phoenicia proper.\n\n==== Tyrian purple ====\nThe most famed and coveted of Phoenician artistic and commercial goods were fabrics and textiles dyed with [[Tyrian purple]] (named after the major Phoenician city-state of Tyre). In fact, the name ''Phoenicia'' may have derived from the Greek root word for \"purple,\" indicating the extent to which it was the Phoenician's most sought after trading good. The dye was extracted from sea snails native to the Mediterranean, and may have been discovered by the Phoenicians as early as 1750 BC.<ref>St. Clair, Kassia (2016). ''The Secret Lives of Colour''. London: John Murray. p. 162\u2013164.</ref> According to contemporaneous accounts by neighboring civilizations, Tyrian purple was highly prized because of its resistance to weathering and sunlight, which only made it brighter.\n\nBecause the Phoenicians were the sole purveyor of the dye, and due its labor-intensive creation, Tyrian purple was expensive; it subsequently became associated with the upper classes and soon became a [[status symbol]] in several civilizations, most notably the Roman Empire. Assyrian records of tribute from the Phoenicians include \"garments of brightly colored stuff\" that most likely included Tyrian purple. While the designs, ornamentation, and embroidery used in Phoenician textiles were apparently well regarded, the techniques and specific descriptions are unknown.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\n=== Women ===\nAs was common in ancient and classical times, Phoenician women had few rights and were considered the property of their fathers or husbands. Nonetheless, compared to their counterparts in most of the Mediterranean and Western Asia, they appeared to have enjoyed some freedoms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phoenicia.org/dress.html|title=Phoenicia, Phoenician Dress, Ornaments and Social Habits|website=phoenicia.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> They took part in public events and religious processions, and depictions of banquets show them casually sitting or reclining with men, dancing, and playing music. Women could engage in trade and other business activities, often working as laborers, construction workers, farmers, weavers, and even minors. As in most civilizations at the time, the women's primary role in society was to raise children and tend to the household. Women were expected to dress far more modestly than men; female figures are almost always portrayed as draped from head to feet, with the arms sometimes covered as well. Although they rarely had political power, women took part in community affairs and had some voice in popular civic assembles.<ref>Sanford Holst, ''Phoenician Secrets,'' Santorini Books (2011), p. 44.</ref> At least one woman, Unmiashtart, is recorded to have ruled Sidon in the fifth century B.C.<ref name=\":0\" /> The two most famous Phoenician women are [[Jezebel|Jezebe]]<nowiki/>l, portrayed the Bible as the assertive princess of Sidon, and [[Dido]], the semi-legendary founder and first queen of Carthage.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Canaanite religion}}\n{{See also|Sanchuniathon}}\n\nThe religious practices and beliefs of Phoenicia were cognate generally to their neighbours in [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]], which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the [[Ancient Semitic religions|ancient Semitic world]].{{sfnp|Moscati|1957|loc=e.g., p. 40 & 113}}<ref>[[William Robertson Smith|W.

She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother [[Hadad|Baal]]. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\" (60\u20132), who adds that the Phoenician [[Philo of Byblos]] (64\u2013141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess [[Athena]]. Also, Patai at 63\u20136 identifies Anath with the biblical \"Queen of Heaven\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r\u00f4le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god. Her full name was 'Lady Asherah of the Sea'--apparently her domain proper was the sea, just as that of her husband El was heaven. She was, however, also referred to simply as Elath or Goddess.

The most we can do is ''dream the myth onwards'' and give it a modern dress. And whatever [our] explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well being. ... Hence the \"explanation\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\" ... \"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\"</blockquote></ref>\n\nA problematic theory derived from [[sociology of religion]] proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born ''Libyphoenician'' oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.<ref>Compare {{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}.</ref> A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved eventually to become supreme.<ref name=\"Abun-Nasr, 1971\"/> A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

This most likely did not come from a single instance but from a culmination of commercial exchange.{{sfnp|Moscati|1965}} This suggests a prior a relationship between the Greeks and the Phoenicians.

In both Phoenician and Greek mythologies, [[Cadmus]] is a Phoenician prince, the son of king Agenor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Herodotus credits Cadmus for bringing the Phoenician alphabet to Greece{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=112}} approximately sixteen hundred years before Herodotus' time, or around 2000 BC,{{sfn|Herodotus, The Histories|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D4 II.145.4] }} as he attested:\n{{quote|text=These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks.

He is also the legendary founder of Thebes, one of the most powerful and influential of the classical Greek city-states. Europa, a consort of Zeus and mother of [[Basileus|King]] [[Minos]] of [[Crete]], is Phoenician, and is generally described as the daughter of King Agenor and thus the sister of Cadmus. They in turn have several other siblings that in some incarnations are related to Poseidon. The integration of Phoenician figures into Greek mythology, often in a heroic or privileged position, suggests some degree of Greek affinity towards Phoenicians.\n\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \"Lord of the Sea\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \"Poseidon\u2013Neptune\" figure of Phoenician religion. This figure of \"Poseidon-Neptune\" is mentioned by authors and in various inscriptions as being very important to merchants and sailors,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ribichini |first=S. |year=1988 |chapter=Beliefs and Religious Life |editor=Sabatino Moscati |title=The Phoenicians |pp=104\u201325 |location=Milan |publisher=Gruppo Editoriale Fabbri }}</ref> but a singular name has yet to be found. There are, however, names for sea gods from individual city-states. Yamm is the god of the sea of [[Ugarit]], an ancient city-state north to Phoenicia. Yamm and Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth and often associated with Zeus, have an epic battle for power over the universe. While Yamm is the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos.<ref>Habel, N.C. 1964. ''Yahweh Versus Baal: A Conflict of Religious Cultures''. New York: Bookman Associates</ref> Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power, in some version killing him with a mace fashioned for him, while in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and states he should should stay in his own province for being defeated. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot.<ref>Ringgren, H. 1917. ''Religions of the Ancient Near East''.

While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians [[Raptio|kidnapped]] a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] from [[Argos]]. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall the Persians considered the Greeks to be their enemy.{{sfn|Herodotus, The History|loc=[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html I.1.1\u20135] }}\n\n== Ancient sources ==\n\n=== In the Bible ===\nHiram (also spelled Huran), the king of Tyre, is associated with the building of [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon's temple]]. [[Books of Kings#Contents|1 Kings 5:1]] says: \"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\" [[2 Chronicles]] 2:14 says: \"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him&nbsp;...\"\n\nIn [[Masonic]] lore, [[Hiram Abiff]] is the architect of Solomon's temple and a central figure Masonic rituals and mythology.\n\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: [[Elijah]] execrated [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], the princess from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] who became a consort of King [[Ahab]] and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\n\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \"Syro-Phoenicians\", as in the [[Gospel of Mark]]: \"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\".<ref>7:26</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[Bible]]'' itself derives from Greek ''{{lang|grc|biblion}}'', which means \"book\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of ''[[Byblos]]'', the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Bible&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. \"Bible\"]. Retrieved November 27, 2012.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nDue to the paucity of written records from the Phoenicians themselves, their civilization was long overshadowed by those of neighboring Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. Beginning in the early 1960s, new and reexamined discoveries by scholars and archaeologists have shed more light on the Phoenicians and their contributions and achievements. \nThe most widely known legacy was their development and transmission of an [[alphabet]] throughout the Mediterranean, which directly inspired the Greek alphabet that, in turn, influenced the Latin alphabet and numerous European languages thereafter. The Phoenician alphabet allowed for a simplified writing system that did not require a narrow caste of professional scribes, priests, and officials as in Egypt or Mesopotamia. It could be written on a variety of media and was easy to learn due to its fixed nature, allowing for easier communication across classes and cultures. In addition to facilitating commercial relations\u2014and thus leading to an exchange of goods and ideas that brought prosperity to different societies across the region\u2014it's been argued that the Phoenician alphabet's \"egalitarian\" nature proved pivotal to the progress of civilization as a whole.<blockquote>The alphabetical (like the numerical) system is how societies organize information. Beyond literacy and systematization, the alphabet stimulates both abstract and rational thought through the phonetic coding and decoding process. As a result, the adoption of Phoenician letters\u2014 especially in Ionia and Athens\u2014created an intellectual environment for the development of Greek, and, subsequently, Western science.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>Anthropologist Ralph Linton argues that the Phoenician's \"main role in the development of the Greek and other Mediterranean cultures was as intermediaries between Asia and Europe.\"<ref>Ralph Linton, The Tree of Culture (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1956), 341.</ref> This was aided by Phoenicia's location at the crossroads of the major civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia. One of the few civilizations to emerge from the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] relatively unscathed, the Phoenicians led the way in reopening trade routes that connected the Egyptian, Greek, and Mesopotamian civilizations. As the dominant seafarers and traders well into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians maintained an unparalleled commercial network that revitalized the region and contributed to the \"civilizational development of the Mediterranean basin.\" Historian [[Jerry H. Bentley]] argues that this Phoenician-led flourishing of maritime commerce also furthered the economic, social, and cultural integration of the Mediterranean, leading to unprecedented ties and exchanges between otherwise distinct civilizations.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans eventually emulated this Phoenician model, laying the foundation of the \"Mediterranean as a single economic, political, and cultural unit.\" [[Hans G. Niemeyer]], an expert in Iron Age Phoenicia, claims the Phoenicians \"sparked Western civilization\" through their \"transfusion of Eastern goods, technologies, and ideas that, in turn, became the foundations of Greco-Roman civilization.\" He also credits Phoenicia for the \"dissemination of urban civilization, in the propagation of technical innovations, in the distribution of new [aristocratic] lifestyle paradigms and \u2018modern\u2019 economics.\" The Phoenician mercantile system encouraged the division of labor and accumulation of wealth that allowed for state-building; the adoption of this model is credited for the development of states from Greece to Spain.<ref>Susan Sherratt and Andrew Sherratt, \u201cThe Growth of the Mediterranean Economy in the Early First Millennium BC,\u201d World Archeology 24 (1993): 367, 369.</ref>  These civilizations acknowledged the Phoenician's contributions.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition to various manufactured goods and resources, Phoenicians traders imparted the West with Mesopotamian astronomical and mathematical ideas and Egyptian architectural and artistic styles. The \"[[Orientalising period|Orientalising]]\" trend later seen in [[Greek art]] is attributed to the Phoenicians, whose own artistic tradition was an amalgamation of different cultures in the Mediterranean and Near East. The forerunner of [[Ionic order]] and [[Ashlar|ashlar masonry]], which remain staples of classical architecture throughout the West, was the Proto-Aeolic capital developed by Phoenicians. Similarly, Bronze Age Phoenicians developed [[lime mortar]] from which the Greeks created true cement and Romans produced concrete.<ref>Yigal Shiloh (1979). ''The Proto-Aeolic capital and Israelite ashlar masonry''. Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</ref>\n\nHistorian of science [[Leonid Zhmud]] observes \"Semitic borrowings\" and \"Oriental influence\" with respect to the weights, measures, and mathematical calculations utilized by the Greeks. The abacus, which emerged in the fifth century B.C. and remained in widespread use until the late 18th century, likely reached Greece from Phoenicia\n\nPhoenician city-states may have developed \"proto-democratic\" political structures, such as councils of elders and popular assemblies, that possibly inspired democratic Greek city-states such as Athens.<ref name=\":5\">Scott, John C.

Several scholars have claimed Punic / Phoenician influence in Sparta's political development.<ref name=\"Stephen Stockwell 2010\"/>\n\nAs the earliest known people to engage in expansive maritime trade and seafaring, the Phoenicians developed numerous naval and navigational innovations that were adopted by neighboring societies. The bireme, a multi-tiered oared vessel, was created some time in the eighth century B.C. and became common throughout the Mediterranean region, eventually being evolved by the Romans. As the first people to have explored beyond the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], and first to colonise the Western Mediterranean in any significant way, the Phoenicians inspired similar maritime ventures by the Greeks and Romans. Beginning the eighth century B.C., the Greek city-states of [[Euboea]] and Corinth led the movement towards colonization by learning shipbuilding, navigational techniques, and the east-west trade routes of the Phoenicians. Following contact by the Phoenicians with mainland Italy as in the tenth century B.C., the Etruscans and other Italian peoples learned the Phoenician methods of celestial navigation, weights and measures, and even finance that centuries later were received by the Romans.\n\nLong after the Phoenicians ceased to be an independent polity, their successors remained influential and aware of their Phoenician roots. [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], was possibly of Phoenician heritage.<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, vii. 3</ref> [[Roman Carthage]], an early epicenter of Christianity, produced some of the earliest and most influential Christian theologians, such as Tertullian and St. Augustine, who were of Punic / Phoenician heritage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Maronites]]\n* [[Names of the Levant]]\n* [[Phoenicianism]]\n* [[Punic language]]\n* [[Punics]]\n* [[Tarout Island]]\n* [[Theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas]]\n* [[Israelites]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aubet |first=Maria Eugenia |year=2001 |title=The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade |translator-last = Turton |translator-first = Mary |publisher=Cambridge University Pres |isbn=978-0-521-79543-2 |ref=harv }} See [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-12-17.html Review by Roger Wright], University of Liverpool.\n* {{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=George Aaron |author-link = George Aaron Barton |year=1934 |title = Semitic and Hamitic Origins.

A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|page=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter.

The Amarna Letters, an Egyptian record of diplomatic exchanges dated 1411-1358 B.C. reveal that neighboring Amorites and Hittites were capturing Phoenician vassals of Egypt between 1350 and 1300 B.C. The Late Bronze Age collapse severely weakened or destroyed numerous civilization in the region, including the Egyptians and Hittites. The Phoenicians, now free from foreign domination and interference, appeared to have weathered the crisis relatively well, emerging as a distinct and organized civilization around 1230 B.C.\n\nThe first textual account of the Phoenicians during the Iron Age comes from the Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser I, in relation to his campaign against the Phoenicians between 1114 and 1076 B.C.\n\n=== High point: 1200\u2013800 BC ===\n[[Fernand Braudel]] remarked that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111. While Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland, Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nSyria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] from 82 until 69&nbsp;BC, when he was defeated by [[Lucullus]].

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the eighth century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]; the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornish tin]] was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Champion |first=Timothy |title=The appropriation of the Phoenicians in British imperial ideology |journal=Nations and Nationalism |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013465 |doi=10.1111/1469-8219.00027 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarshish]] ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the [[Land of Israel]] by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia.

Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called [[Fenius Farsa]]. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by [[Hanno the Navigator]] explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the [[Gulf of Guinea]]; Herodotus described a Phoenician expedition sent down the [[Red Sea]] by Egyptian pharaoh [[Necho II]] ({{circa|600&nbsp;BC}}) that [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] Africa and returned through the [[Pillars of Hercules]] after three years.\n\nIn the [[2nd millennium BC|2nd millennium B.C.]], the Phoenicians had a flourishing trade with Somali city-states in the Horn of Africa, particularly [[Mosylon]], [[Opone]], [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], [[Sarapion]], [[Mundus (city)|Mundus]] and [[Tabae]]. \n\n=== Phoenician ships ===\nAs a predominately maritime people, the Phoenicians were among the earliest and most influential pioneers in shipbuilding and design. Naval historian [[Richard Woodman]] described them as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the inventors of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\" \n\nAs early as 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. During the Bronze Age, they developed the [[keel]], the bottom-most longitudinal structural element on a ship, which was a significant advancement over the more common [[Dugout canoe|dugout]] vessels, which were limited in size, durability, maneuverability. Pegged [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joints were developed to make Phoenician ships sturdier, and proved effective enough to serve as a standard template across the Mediterranean until late into the Roman Empire.\n\nOther key ship components, such as the [[Brail|brailed rig sail]], which allowed for greater maneuverability, and the [[crow's nest]], which provided a vital lookout point, most likely originated in the Levant. Around 700 B.C., the Phoenicians were possibly the first to introduce the [[bireme]], a large war [[galley]] that had two banks of oars staggered on either side of the vessel, allowing for significantly greater propulsion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/galley-ship|title=Galley {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Carthaginians, who descended from the Phoenicians, had become a major power in the western Mediterranean largely because of their ability to efficient mass produce ships; parts were even labeled with the Punic alphabet.<ref>Piero Bartoloni, \u201cShips and Navigation,\u201d in The Phoenicians, ed. Sabatino Moscati (New York: Abbeville, 1988), p 76.</ref>\n\nIn addition to ships, the Phoenicians developed or contributed several other maritime inventions. the [[amphora]], a type of container used for both dry and liquid gods, was an ancient Phoenician invention that became a standardized measurement of volume for close to two thousand years. The remnants of sophisticated and self-cleaning artificial harbors have been discovered in Sidon, Tyre, Atlit, and Acre.<ref>Arad Haggi, \u201cReport on Underwater Excavation at the Phoenician Harbour, Atlit, Israel,\u201d International Journal of Nautical Archeology 39 (2010): 283.</ref> The Phoenicians relied on [[celestial navigation]], and most likely discovered Polaris (the North Star), which enabled nighttime sailing and shorter open-sea routes; the Greeks subsequently called Polaris the \"Phoenician Star.\" The wind rose, a precursor to the compass rose, was apparently of Phoenician, or at least Levantine, origin. The first example of [[admiralty law]] also appears in the Levant.<ref>Shelley Wachsmann, Seagoing Ships & Seamanship in the Bronze Age Levant (College Station, TX: Texas A & M University Press, 1998), 300, 51, 323-325, 332.</ref> The Phoenicians continued to contribute to cartography into the Iron Age.<ref>Mark Woolmer, Ancient Phoenicia: An Introduction (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2011), p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: {{lang|grc-Latn|Galloi}} (tubs) and {{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}} (horses). The names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, which were tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and had horse heads on both ends. (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that the ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]], equated with the Semitic-Levantine god [[Yam (god)|Yam]].\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship was found near [[Gozo]] island in Malta. Dated 700 BC, it is one of the oldest wrecks in the Mediterranean.

Numerous others existed, including Berut (modern [[Beirut]]) Ampi, Amia, Arqa, [[Baalbek]], Botrys, Sarepta and [[Tripoli]]. From the late tenth century BC, the Phoenician's expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies beyond Lebanon and throughout the Mediterranean.

The first century A.D. geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] once described the Phoenicians as \"a clever race, who prospered in war and peace\" and \"excelled in writing and literature, and in other arts, in seamanship, and in ruling an empire.\"<ref name=\":0\">The Phoenicians: A Captivating Guide to the History of Phoenicia and the Impact Made by One of the Greatest Trading Civilizations of the Ancient World, ''Captivating History'' (December 16, 2019), ISBN: 9781647482053, p. 31.</ref> By contrast, their reputation as primarily traders and merchants meant they were sometimes regarded as overly materialistic, unprincipled, and rapacious.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nPhoenicians had much in common with other Canaanites, including language, religion, social customs, and a monarchical political system centered around city-states. However, by the early Iron Age (roughly 1300 B.C.) the Phoenicians had emerged as a distinct people, with their culture, economy, and daily life being heavily centered on commerce and maritime trade. Their propensity for seafaring brought them into contact with numerous other civilizations, possibly more so than any other contemporary people, leading to a uniquely cosmopolitan society that incorporated different customs, artistic styles, and faith traditions. \n\n=== Political structure ===\nDespite a shared language, culture, and religion, the Phoenicians never constituted a single, cohesive political unit, and it is unknown whether they viewed themselves as a nation in the modern sense. The Phoenicians organized themselves along city-states that were fiercely independent in both domestic and foreign affairs. Formal alliances between city-states was rare, and cooperation was generally informal, loosely aligned, and ad hoc. Unlike their Greek counterparts, warfare between Phoenician city-states was rare, although rivalries did exist and coercion was sometimes employed. The relative power and influence of city-states varied over time. Sidon was dominant between the 12th and 11th centuries B.C., and exercise some influence over its neighbors, but by the tenth century B.C., Tyre rose to become the most powerful polity. \n\nPhoenician society was highly stratified and predominantly [[Monarchy|monarchical]]. Heredity kings usually governed with absolute power and had responsibilities over civic, commercial, and religious affairs. Rulers often relied upon senior officials derived from the noble and merchant classes. The priesthood was a distinct class, though usually of royal lineage or from leading merchant families. The king was considered a representative of the gods and carried many obligations and duties with respective to religious processions and rituals. Priests were thus highly influential and often became intertwined with the royal family. \n\nUnlike their Greek and Egyptian counterparts, Phoenician kings did not commemorate their reign through sculptures or monuments. Their wealth, power, and accomplishments were usually conveyed through ornate sarcophaguses, of which the most famous is [[Ahiram sarcophagus|Ahiram]] of Byblos. The Phoenicians kept fairly meticulous records of their rulers in the form of tomb inscriptions, which are among the few primary sources still available. Historians have been able to determine a clear line of succession spanning centuries for some city-states, notably Byblos and Tyre.\n\n==== Proto-democratic government ====\nNot all Phoenician city-states were governed as absolute monarchies. The long span of Phoenician history yielded various political changes and experiments. In the sixth century B.C., Tyre adopted a system of government consisting of a pair of judges known as ''suffetes,'' each chosen from the most powerful noble families and wielding absolute power. By the seventh century B.C., many city-states had circumscribed the power of their kings, who thereafter had to share power with largely independent sailors and traders, on whom the prosperity of the city-state heavily rested. Kings increasingly required the support of different stakeholders, and there is evidence that the councils and assemblies that had previously played an advisory role had accumulated some power over the state. The Greek historian [[Arrian]] reported that senior officials were sometimes called upon to govern when the king was predisposed, and accounts from other outsiders claimed that councils were the true rulers, such that they could impose their decisions on the king during emergencies.\n\nThere is some sparse evidence, mostly from Egyptian and Assyrian diplomatic records, that certain Phoenician city-states had constitutions and republican forms of government. As early as the fourteenth century B.C., Egyptian envoys reported that assemblies \"might act on their own behalf;\" when the city-state of Irqata declared its allegiance to the pharaoh, it did so as \"Irqata and its elders\" without reference to a king.<ref name=\":1\">Stephen Stockwell, Geopolitics, History, and International Relations , Vol. 2, No. 2 (2010), pp. 123- 135</ref> Similarly, the pharaoh is addressed by \"the citizens of Tunip,\" the \u201cpeople from Gubla (Byblos),\" and \"the men of Arwad.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In the fourth century B.C., when the armies of Alexander the Great approached Tyre, they were met not by a king but by \"representatives\" of the \"the commonwealth\" or the \"community.\" In a diplomatic exchange, it was \"the people\" of Tyre who passed a decree in response.\n\nIn light of these accounts, some scholars have argued that the Phoenicians had at least experimented with proto-democratic forms of government, possibly evening influencing the development of democracy in Athens.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): 123-133.</ref>\n\n=== Law and administration ===\nAfter the king and council, the two most important political positions in virtually every Phoenician city-state were that of governor and commander of the army. Details regarding the duties of these offices are sparse, but it is known that the governor was responsible for collecting taxes, implementing decrees, supervising judges, and ensuring the administration of law and justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> As warfare was rare among the mostly mercantile Phoenicians, the commander of the army was generally responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the city-state and its hintelands.\n\nThe Phoenicians had a system of courts and judges that resolved disputes and punished crimes based on a semi-codified body of law and traditional. Laws were implemented by the state and were the responsibility of the ruler and certain designated officials. In common with other Levantine societies, laws were harsh and biased, reflecting the social stratification of society. The murder of a commoner was treated as less serious than of a nobleman, and the upper classes had the most rights; the wealthy could often escape punishment by paying a fine. Free men could represent themselves in court and had more rights than women and children, while slaves had no rights at all. Men could often deflect punishment to their wives, children, or slaves, even having them serve his sentence in his place. Lawyers eventually emerged as a profession for those who could not plead their own case.\n\nAs in neighboring societies at the time, penalties for crimes were often severe, usually reflecting the principle of reciprocity; for example, the killing of a slave would be punished by having the offender's slave killed. Imprisonment was rare, with fines, exile, punishment, and execution were main remedies.\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Phoenician language|Phoenician alphabet|Alphabet}}\n\nThe Phoenician alphabet was one of the first (consonantal) alphabets with a strict and consistent form.

There are Greek accounts describing the arrival of Phoenician traders bearing \"trinkets and baubles.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> The Phoenicians appeared to have used their knowledge of foreign artistic styles to craft goods that would specifically appeal to certain trading partners, distinguishing not only different cultures but even socioeconomic classes.<ref name=\":4\" /> This is also evidenced in the broad distribution of Phoenician goods, which have been found as west as Spain and Morocco, as north as Russia and as east as Iraq. In fact, much of what is known about Phoenician art is based from excavations outside of Phoenicia proper.\n\n==== Tyrian purple ====\nThe most famed and coveted of Phoenician artistic and commercial goods were fabrics and textiles dyed with [[Tyrian purple]] (named after the major Phoenician city-state of Tyre). In fact, the name ''Phoenicia'' may have derived from the Greek root word for \"purple,\" indicating the extent to which it was the Phoenician's most sought after trading good. The dye was extracted from sea snails native to the Mediterranean, and may have been discovered by the Phoenicians as early as 1750 BC.<ref>St. Clair, Kassia (2016). ''The Secret Lives of Colour''. London: John Murray. p. 162\u2013164.</ref> According to contemporaneous accounts by neighboring civilizations, Tyrian purple was highly prized because of its resistance to weathering and sunlight, which only made it brighter. \n\nBecause the Phoenicians were the sole purveyor of the dye, and due its labor-intensive creation, Tyrian purple was expensive; it subsequently became associated with the upper classes and soon became a [[status symbol]] in several civilizations, most notably the Roman Empire. Assyrian records of tribute from the Phoenicians include \"garments of brightly colored stuff\" that most likely included Tyrian purple. While the designs, ornamentation, and embroidery used in Phoenician textiles were apparently well regarded, the techniques and specific descriptions are unknown.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Women ===\nAs was common in ancient and classical times, Phoenician women had few rights and were considered the property of their fathers or husbands.

Women could engage in trade and other business activities, often working as laborers, construction workers, farmers, weavers, and even minors. As in most civilizations at the time, the women's primary role in society was to raise children and tend to the household. Women were expected to dress far more modestly than men; female figures are almost always portrayed as draped from head to feet, with the arms sometimes covered as well. Although they rarely had political power, women took part in community affairs and had some voice in popular civic assembles.<ref>Sanford Holst, ''Phoenician Secrets,'' Santorini Books (2011), p. 44.</ref> At least one woman, Unmiashtart, is recorded to have ruled Sidon in the fifth century B.C.<ref name=\":0\" /> The two most famous Phoenician women are [[Jezebel|Jezebe]]<nowiki/>l, portrayed the Bible as the assertive princess of Sidon, and [[Dido]], the semi-legendary founder and first queen of Carthage.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Canaanite religion}}\n{{See also|Sanchuniathon}}\n\nThe religious practices and beliefs of Phoenicia were cognate generally to their neighbours in [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]], which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the [[Ancient Semitic religions|ancient Semitic world]].{{sfnp|Moscati|1957|loc=e.g., p. 40 & 113}}<ref>[[William Robertson Smith|W.

She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother [[Hadad|Baal]]. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\" (60\u20132), who adds that the Phoenician [[Philo of Byblos]] (64\u2013141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess [[Athena]]. Also, Patai at 63\u20136 identifies Anath with the biblical \"Queen of Heaven\".

The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

The integration of Phoenician figures into Greek mythology, often in a heroic or privileged position, suggests some degree of Greek affinity towards Phoenicians.\n\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \"Lord of the Sea\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \"Poseidon\u2013Neptune\" figure of Phoenician religion.

[[Books of Kings#Contents|1 Kings 5:1]] says: \"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\" [[2 Chronicles]] 2:14 says: \"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him&nbsp;...\"\n\nIn [[Masonic]] lore, [[Hiram Abiff]] is the architect of Solomon's temple and a central figure Masonic rituals and mythology. \n\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: [[Elijah]] execrated [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], the princess from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] who became a consort of King [[Ahab]] and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\n\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \"Syro-Phoenicians\", as in the [[Gospel of Mark]]: \"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\".<ref>7:26</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[Bible]]'' itself derives from Greek ''{{lang|grc|biblion}}'', which means \"book\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of ''[[Byblos]]'', the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Bible&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v. \"Bible\"]. Retrieved November 27, 2012.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nDue to the paucity of written records from the Phoenicians themselves, their civilization was long overshadowed by those of neighboring Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. Beginning in the early 1960s, new and reexamined discoveries by scholars and archaeologists have shed more light on the Phoenicians and their contributions and achievements. \nThe most widely known legacy was their development and transmission of an [[alphabet]] throughout the Mediterranean, which directly inspired the Greek alphabet that, in turn, influenced the Latin alphabet and numerous European languages thereafter. The Phoenician alphabet allowed for a simplified writing system that did not require a narrow caste of professional scribes, priests, and officials as in Egypt or Mesopotamia. It could be written on a variety of media and was easy to learn due to its fixed nature, allowing for easier communication across classes and cultures. In addition to facilitating commercial relations\u2014and thus leading to an exchange of goods and ideas that brought prosperity to different societies across the region\u2014it's been argued that the Phoenician alphabet's \"egalitarian\" nature proved pivotal to the progress of civilization as a whole.<blockquote>The alphabetical (like the numerical) system is how societies organize information. Beyond literacy and systematization, the alphabet stimulates both abstract and rational thought through the phonetic coding and decoding process. As a result, the adoption of Phoenician letters\u2014 especially in Ionia and Athens\u2014created an intellectual environment for the development of Greek, and, subsequently, Western science.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>Anthropologist Ralph Linton argues that the Phoenician's \"main role in the development of the Greek and other Mediterranean cultures was as intermediaries between Asia and Europe.\"<ref>Ralph Linton, The Tree of Culture (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1956), 341.</ref> This was aided by Phoenicia's location at the crossroads of the major civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia. One of the few civilizations to emerge from the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] relatively unscathed, the Phoenicians led the way in reopening trade routes that connected the Egyptian, Greek, and Mesopotamian civilizations. As the dominant seafarers and traders well into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians maintained an unparalleled commercial network that revitalized the region and contributed to the \"civilizational development of the Mediterranean basin.\" Historian [[Jerry H. Bentley]] argues that this Phoenician-led flourishing of maritime commerce also furthered the economic, social, and cultural integration of the Mediterranean, leading to unprecedented ties and exchanges between otherwise distinct civilizations. \n\nThe Greeks and Romans eventually emulated this Phoenician model, laying the foundation of the \"Mediterranean as a single economic, political, and cultural unit.\" [[Hans G. Niemeyer]], an expert in Iron Age Phoenicia, claims the Phoenicians \"sparked Western civilization\" through their \"transfusion of Eastern goods, technologies, and ideas that, in turn, became the foundations of Greco-Roman civilization.\" He also credits Phoenicia for the \"dissemination of urban civilization, in the propagation of technical innovations, in the distribution of new [aristocratic] lifestyle paradigms and \u2018modern\u2019 economics.\" The Phoenician mercantile system encouraged the division of labor and accumulation of wealth that allowed for state-building; the adoption of this model is credited for the development of states from Greece to Spain.<ref>Susan Sherratt and Andrew Sherratt, \u201cThe Growth of the Mediterranean Economy in the Early First Millennium BC,\u201d World Archeology 24 (1993): 367, 369.</ref>  These civilizations acknowledged the Phoenician's contributions.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition to various manufactured goods and resources, Phoenicians traders imparted the West with Mesopotamian astronomical and mathematical ideas and Egyptian architectural and artistic styles. The \"[[Orientalising period|Orientalising]]\" trend later seen in [[Greek art]] is attributed to the Phoenicians, whose own artistic tradition was an amalgamation of different cultures in the Mediterranean and Near East. The forerunner of [[Ionic order]] and [[Ashlar|ashlar masonry]], which remain staples of classical architecture throughout the West, was the Proto-Aeolic capital developed by Phoenicians. Similarly, Bronze Age Phoenicians developed [[lime mortar]] from which the Greeks created true cement and Romans produced concrete.<ref>Yigal Shiloh (1979). ''The Proto-Aeolic capital and Israelite ashlar masonry''. Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</ref>\n\nHistorian of science [[Leonid Zhmud]] observes \"Semitic borrowings\" and \"Oriental influence\" with respect to the weights, measures, and mathematical calculations utilized by the Greeks. The abacus, which emerged in the fifth century B.C. and remained in widespread use until the late 18th century, likely reached Greece from Phoenicia\n\nPhoenician city-states may have developed \"proto-democratic\" political structures, such as councils of elders and popular assemblies, that possibly inspired democratic Greek city-states such as Athens.<ref name=\":5\">Scott, John C. (2018) ''The Phoenicians and the Formation of the Western World'', Comparative Civilizations Review: Vol. 78\u00a0: No. 78 , Article 4. <nowiki>https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/ccr/vol78/iss78/4</nowiki></ref> The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle also found similarities between Spartan and Carthaginian constitutions. Several scholars have claimed Punic / Phoenician influence in Sparta's political development.<ref>Stephen Stockwell, \u201cBefore Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\u201d Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): 123-133.</ref>\n\nAs the earliest known people to engage in expansive maritime trade and seafaring, the Phoenicians developed numerous naval and navigational innovations that were adopted by neighboring societies. The bireme, a multi-tiered oared vessel, was created some time in the eighth century B.C. and became common throughout the Mediterranean region, eventually being evolved by the Romans. As the first people to have explored beyond the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], and first to colonise the Western Mediterranean in any significant way, the Phoenicians inspired similar maritime ventures by the Greeks and Romans. Beginning the eighth century B.C., the Greek city-states of [[Euboea]] and Corinth led the movement towards colonization by learning shipbuilding, navigational techniques, and the east-west trade routes of the Phoenicians. Following contact by the Phoenicians with mainland Italy as in the tenth century B.C., the Etruscans and other Italian peoples learned the Phoenician methods of celestial navigation, weights and measures, and even finance that centuries later were received by the Romans.\n\nLong after the Phoenicians ceased to be an independent polity, their successors remained influential and aware of their Phoenician roots. [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], was possibly of Phoenician heritage.<ref>Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, vii. 3</ref> [[Roman Carthage]], an early epicenter of Christianity, produced some of the earliest and most influential Christian theologians, such as Tertullian and St. Augustine, who were of Punic / Phoenician heritage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Maronites]]\n* [[Names of the Levant]]\n* [[Phoenicianism]]\n* [[Punic language]]\n* [[Punics]]\n* [[Tarout Island]]\n* [[Theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas]]\n* [[Israelites]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aubet |first=Maria Eugenia |year=2001 |title=The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade |translator-last = Turton |translator-first = Mary |publisher=Cambridge University Pres |isbn=978-0-521-79543-2 |ref=harv }} See [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-12-17.html Review by Roger Wright], University of Liverpool.\n* {{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=George Aaron |author-link = George Aaron Barton |year=1934 |title = Semitic and Hamitic Origins.

In all government records, Lisu are Yobin, and sometimes used alternately. Lisu is one of the minority tribes of Arunachal Pradesh of India. They live mainly in Vijoynagar Circle in 11 villages. Gandhigram (or Shidi in Lisu) is the largest village. Lisus are found in Miao town and Injan village of Kharsang Circle [[Changlang District]]. The Lisu traditionally lived in the Yunnan Province of China and northern Myanmar. There are about 5,000 Lisu people in India.\n\n===Government discovering Lisu===\nOn 7 May 1961, the 7th Assam Rifles expedition team led by Major Sumer Singh entered the Noa-dihing river valley and reached the largest village in the valley, Shidi (now called Gandhigram). They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and were further told by the villagers that they were the first party to have visited the area since World War II. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that this virgin land was Indian territory and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then the international border was not clearly demarcated. In 1972, the Demarcation of International Border with Burma was done, with the help of Lisu guides having a full knowledge of the region. During demarcation, cement International Border Pillars (IBP) were erected at regular intervals.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nInitially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the [[McMahon Line|Topographical Survey of British India]] as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the [[Hkakabo Razi]] (alt. {{convert|5881|m|abbr=on}}; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a \"combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests\".<ref>[[:File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg]]</ref> Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar's diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, \"there was no trace of man\" either Lisu or any other tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.528129|title=Forgotten Frontier(1945)|last=Tyson Geoffrey|date=17 August 2018|website=Archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> The border negotiations with China that [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War|led]] to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the [[North-East Frontier Agency|North East region]], defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to built the air strip at Vijoynagar.

The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from [[North Lakhimpur|Lakhimpur, Assam]] (the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943. Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Burma. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh.

In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.\n\nExcept for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as \"prisoners of geography\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2620/stories/20091009262006400.htm|title=Prisoners of geography|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nLisu were evicted from their villages in 1964 under the command of A.S. Guarya, the late Governor General of Arunachal Pradesh. He settled Indian ex-servicemen in their villages. Those villages still retain their original names. The Lisu were chased out of their villages down to Gandhigram villages and other areas. These villages suffered from floods and lost much of their rice paddies and had to find new ground.\n\nIn fact, [[Namdapha]] was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as \"encroachers\" as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbaindia.org/uploaded/Biodiversityindia/Legal/15.%20Wildlife%20(Protection)%20Act,%201972.pdf|title=THE WILDLIFE (PROTECTION) ACT, 1972 (No. 53 of 1972)|date=9 September 1972|website=Nbaindia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> Between 1976 and 1981, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through [[Namdapha National Park]] but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides.

Each family clan has its own name or surname. The largest families among the tribal clans are Putao Laemae pha (who speak some [[a sub-language of Bai languages|Bai]]), Bya pha, Tung pha, Ngwa Pha(Ngwazah), Naw pha (some of them are descended from [[Anung or Khingphang]] patriclans), Seu pha, Southern Laemae pha or Tsao jia pha (also known as a decedent of Yi tribe people), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in primitive times. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty, most Hua Lisu people had become a people that lived in villages high in the mountains or in mountain valleys. However, those who still lived in the Paoshan plains, standing on the side of the [[Qing Dynasty]], fought against the Kingdom of Ming. The Lisu [[knife ladder]] climbing festival was first held as a memorial event of victory over Ming in 1644 CE. The Lisu people adopted their own traditional dance so called \"che-ngoh-che\" along with the Lisu [[guitar]] which has no bars on the [[fretboard]] from Han Chinese. They also used a musical instrument called [[fulu jewlew]] possibly invented by Yi tribe people. It is a kind of [[flute]] that has about six or seven small [[bamboo]] tubes tied up together to a dried-hollow-[[gourd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nSongs and dances differ according to the occasion. Weddings, homecomings, harvests, and other ceremonial events all have their corresponding music and dances.\n\nLisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking.<ref name=\"Dessaint 1972\"/>  Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\"/>\n\nLisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables.  However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival.  This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the [[opium]] poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability.  This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative [[heroin]], except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of [[arthritis]].<ref>Durrenberger 1976</ref>\n\nThe Lisu practiced [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of [[horticulture]]. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies,<ref>Fox 2000</ref><ref>Fox et al. 1995</ref> enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.<ref>McCaskill and Kempe 1997</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best-known subgroup of the Lisu is the Flowery Lisu in Thailand, due to hill tribe tourism.  Lisu women are notable for their brightly colored dress.  They wear a multi-colored knee-length tunics of red, blue, or green with a wide black belt and blue or black pants. Sleeve shoulders and cuffs are decorated with a dense applique of narrow horizontal bands of blue, red and yellow. Men wear baggy pants, usually in bright colors but normally wear a more Western-type of shirt or top.\n\nAround 2002, as cellular phone signals reached deeper and deeper into the valleys of northern Thailand, the Lisu embraced the technology in unanticipated fashion: the Lisu purchased unlimited calling plans and started to sing and improvise to each other over mobile connections. Lisu people who still adhere to animistic beliefs sing the traditional chants of the story tellers, adding their own improvisations.\n\nThe Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-people.com|title=Amazing People \u2013 doco stories & palces|website=Amazing-people.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Christianity===\n{{further|Lisu Church}}\nBeginning in the early 20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to [[Christianity]].

It is logged that by the effort of Morse family and missionaries, many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before [[World War II]], the Lisu tribes who live in Yunnan, China and Ah-Jhar river valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ.

And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.<ref>Fish, David 23.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, the missionaries learned the situation of Lisu culture, so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching [[hymns]], sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists.

The Lisu form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by China. In Burma (Myanmar), the Lisu are recognized as one of 135 ethnic groups and an estimated population of 600,000. Lisu live in northern Myanmar; [[Kachin State]] ([[Putao]], [[Myitkyina]], [[Tanai Township|Danai]], [[Waingmaw]], [[Bhamo]]), Shan state, ([[Momeik]]), ([[Namhsan]], [[Lashio]], [[Hopang]], and [[Kokang]]) and southern [[Shan State]] ([[Namsang]], [[Loilem]], [[Mongton]]) and, Sagaing Division ([[Katha Township|Katha]] and [[Hkamti Township|Khamti]]), [[Mandalay Division]] ([[Mogok]] and [[Pyin Oo Lwin]]). Approximately 55,000 live in [[Thailand]], where they are one of the six main [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribes]]. They mainly inhabit remote mountainous areas.\n\nThe Lisu tribe consists of more than 58 different clans. Each family clan has its own name or surname. The biggest family clans well known among the tribe clans are Laemae pha, Bya pha, Thorne pha, Ngwa Pha, Naw pha(Ngwazah), Seu pha, Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in the primitive time. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.<ref>Hill Tribes, Lonely Planet, have a map.

In all government records, Lisu are Yobin, and sometimes used alternately. Lisu is one of the minority tribes of Arunachal Pradesh of India. They live mainly in Vijoynagar Circle in 11 villages. Gandhigram (or Shidi in Lisu) is the largest village. Lisus are found in Miao town and Injan village of Kharsang Circle [[Changlang District]]. The Lisu traditionally lived in the Yunnan Province of China and northern Myanmar. There are about 5,000 Lisu people in India.\n\n===Government discovering Lisu===\nOn 7 May 1961, the 7th Assam Rifles expedition team led by Major Sumer Singh entered the Noa-dihing river valley and reached the largest village in the valley, Shidi (now called Gandhigram). They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and were further told by the villagers that they were the first party to have visited the area since World War II. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that this virgin land was Indian territory and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then the international border was not clearly demarcated. In 1972, the Demarcation of International Border with Burma was done, with the help of Lisu guides having a full knowledge of the region. During demarcation, cement International Border Pillars (IBP) were erected at regular intervals.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nInitially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the [[McMahon Line|Topographical Survey of British India]] as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the [[Hkakabo Razi]] (alt. {{convert|5881|m|abbr=on}}; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a \"combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests\".<ref>[[:File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg]]</ref> Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar's diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, \"there was no trace of man\" either Lisu or any other tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.528129|title=Forgotten Frontier(1945)|last=Tyson Geoffrey|date=17 August 2018|website=Archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> The border negotiations with China that [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War|led]] to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the [[North-East Frontier Agency|North East region]], defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to built the air strip at Vijoynagar. In 1969\u201370, 200 families were settled in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arunachalgovernor.gov.in/pr/pr030410.htm|title=The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh :: Governor visits remote Vijoynagar|website=Arunachalgovernor.gov.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> In 2010, the population was estimated at 5500 including Gorkhali Jawan(Ex-Assam Rifles Pensioners and Lisus/Yobin.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Via Myanmar-Ledo Road===\nSome groups of Lisus took the then [[Ledo Road]]. Some of them worked as coal miners under British. (One certificate that originally belonged to one Aphu Lisu is a British coal miner's certificate from 1918, preserved by the Lisu). The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from [[North Lakhimpur|Lakhimpur, Assam]] (the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943. Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Burma. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh. While most have lost their mother tongue, some have preserved the language and culture almost intact.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://changlang.nic.in/changlang.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512100140/http://www.changlang.nic.in/changlang.html#people/ |archive-date=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies|author=John McCoy, Timothy Light|publisher=BRILL|pages=915\u20136|year=1986|isbn=90-04-07850-9}}</ref>\n\n===Indian/Lisu issues===\nIn the early 1980s, the Lisu people living in India did not have Indian citizenship as they were considered refugees from Burma ([[Myanmar]]). In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.\n\nExcept for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as \"prisoners of geography\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2620/stories/20091009262006400.htm|title=Prisoners of geography|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nLisu were evicted from their villages in 1964 under the command of A.S. Guarya, the late Governor General of Arunachal Pradesh. He settled Indian ex-servicemen in their villages. Those villages still retain their original names. The Lisu were chased out of their villages down to Gandhigram villages and other areas. These villages suffered from floods and lost much of their rice paddies and had to find new ground.\n\nIn fact, [[Namdapha]] was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as \"encroachers\" as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbaindia.org/uploaded/Biodiversityindia/Legal/15.%20Wildlife%20(Protection)%20Act,%201972.pdf|title=THE WILDLIFE (PROTECTION) ACT, 1972 (No. 53 of 1972)|date=9 September 1972|website=Nbaindia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> Between 1976 and 1981, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through [[Namdapha National Park]] but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides.

Each family clan has its own name or surname. The largest families among the tribal clans are Putao Laemae pha (who speak some [[a sub-language of Bai languages|Bai]]), Bya pha, Tung pha, Ngwa Pha(Ngwazah), Naw pha (some of them are descended from [[Anung or Khingphang]] patriclans), Seu pha, Southern Laemae pha or Tsao jia pha (also known as a decedent of Yi tribe people), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in primitive times. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty, most Hua Lisu people had become a people that lived in villages high in the mountains or in mountain valleys. However, those who still lived in the Paoshan plains, standing on the side of the [[Qing Dynasty]], fought against the Kingdom of Ming. The Lisu [[knife ladder]] climbing festival was first held as a memorial event of victory over Ming in 1644 CE. The Lisu people adopted their own traditional dance so called \"che-ngoh-che\" along with the Lisu [[guitar]] which has no bars on the [[fretboard]] from Han Chinese. They also used a musical instrument called [[fulu jewlew]] possibly invented by Yi tribe people. It is a kind of [[flute]] that has about six or seven small [[bamboo]] tubes tied up together to a dried-hollow-[[gourd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nSongs and dances differ according to the occasion. Weddings, homecomings, harvests, and other ceremonial events all have their corresponding music and dances.\n\nLisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking.<ref name=\"Dessaint 1972\"/>  Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\"/>\n\nLisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables.  However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival.  This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the [[opium]] poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability.  This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative [[heroin]], except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of [[arthritis]].<ref>Durrenberger 1976</ref>\n\nThe Lisu practiced [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of [[horticulture]]. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies,<ref>Fox 2000</ref><ref>Fox et al. 1995</ref> enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.<ref>McCaskill and Kempe 1997</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best-known subgroup of the Lisu is the Flowery Lisu in Thailand, due to hill tribe tourism.  Lisu women are notable for their brightly colored dress.  They wear a multi-colored knee-length tunics of red, blue, or green with a wide black belt and blue or black pants. Sleeve shoulders and cuffs are decorated with a dense applique of narrow horizontal bands of blue, red and yellow. Men wear baggy pants, usually in bright colors but normally wear a more Western-type of shirt or top.\n\nAround 2002, as cellular phone signals reached deeper and deeper into the valleys of northern Thailand, the Lisu embraced the technology in unanticipated fashion: the Lisu purchased unlimited calling plans and started to sing and improvise to each other over mobile connections. Lisu people who still adhere to animistic beliefs sing the traditional chants of the story tellers, adding their own improvisations.\n\nThe Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.<ref name=\"Hutheesing 1990\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-people.com|title=Amazing People \u2013 doco stories & palces|website=Amazing-people.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Christianity===\n{{further|Lisu Church}}\nBeginning in the early 20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to [[Christianity]]. Missionaries such as [[James O. Fraser]], Allyn Cooke and [[Isobel Kuhn]] and her husband, John, of the [[China Inland Mission]] (now [[OMF International]]), were active with the Lisu of Yunnan.<ref>{{cite web | title=Yunnan Province of China Government Web | url= http://www.eng.yn.gov.cn/yunnanEnglish/145529160029175808/20050623/378813.html|website=Eng.yn.gov.cn | accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> Among the missionaries, James Outram Fraser (1880\u20131938) was the first missionary to reach the Lisu people in China. Another missionary who evangelized Lisu people in Myanmar was Thara Saw Ba Thaw (1889\u20131968). It is recorded that James Fraser and Saw Ba Thaw together created the [[Fraser alphabet|Lisu alphabet]] in 1914.<ref>The History of Church of Christ in Myanmar, (75 Jubilee Press, 2008), 11.</ref> There were many other missionaries who brought Christianity to Lisu people. David Fish researches,\n\n{{quote|There were over a hundred missionaries those who committed their life for spreading the Gospel among the Lisu people. They came from different denominations and mission; China Inland Mission, Disciples of Christ (Church of Christ), Assembly of God, Pentecostal Churches, and so on. The Lisu people accepted those missionaries and their teaching the Gospel so that they converted into Christianity quickly to be followers of Christ.<ref>David Fish, ''The Lisus and Church of Christ in Myanmar,'' (M.A a research paper, Eastern Bible Institute, Hmawbi, Yangon 2005), 11.</ref>}}\n\nIn addition, the first missionaries in China and Myanmar were Russell Morse and his wife, Gertrude Erma Howe, whom she became Gertrude Morse after marriage with Russell Morse. The Missionaries of Christian Churches or Church of Christ in Myanmar were Morse families.<ref>Dr. Joshua Leme, ''A Church History in Yangon,'' 2012, p. 4.</ref> In their chronology of mission record, Morse family started their mission in China in 1926 and due to political unrest, they traveled to Burma (Myanmar) and began teaching among Lisu tribe in 1930.<ref>Eugene Morse, ''Exodus To A Hidden Valley'' (Ohio: William Collins World Press, 1974), 6e.</ref>\n\nThe Lisu people's convert to Christianity was relatively fast. It is logged that by the effort of Morse family and missionaries, many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before [[World War II]], the Lisu tribes who live in Yunnan, China and Ah-Jhar river valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ.

The missionaries created Lisu literature (the written language). With the help of missionaries, the development had occurred for many years. The researcher's father, U Li Ye Jar testified that within 50 years, the development of the Lisu will be at a high speed. Concerning the work of missionaries, David Fish studied,\n\n{{quote|J. Rusell Morse brought many kinds of fruit such as Washington, Orange, Ruby, King-Orange, and Grapefruit. Nowadays, this fruit-raising had spread from Putao to other parts of Myanmar and become an important national asset. He also trained the people the art of carpentry and the construction of buildings. And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.<ref>Fish, David 23.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, the missionaries learned the situation of Lisu culture, so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching [[hymns]], sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing their agriculture.\n\nThe Chinese government's Religious Affairs Bureau has proposed considering Christianity as the official religion of the Lisu.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Covell | first = Ralph|date=Spring 2008 | title = To Every Tribe | journal = Christian History & Biography | issue = 98 | pages = 27\u201328 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to OMF International estimates, as of 2008, there are now more than 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Burma. Only the Lisu of Thailand have remained unchanged by Christian influences. Christianity is now gradually becoming the dominant religion among the Lisu people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lisu of China | work= OMF International | url= http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/people_groups/lisu_of_china | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref>OMF International (2007), p. 1-2</ref>\n\n===Animism/shamanism/ancestor worship===\nBefore Christianity was introduced to Lisu people, they were animists.

The main Lisu festival corresponds to [[Chinese New Year]] and is celebrated with music, feasting and drinking, as are weddings; people wear large amounts of silver jewelry and wear their best clothes at these times as a means of displaying their success in the previous agricultural year. In each traditional village there is a [[sacred grove]] at the top of the village, where the sky spirit or, in China, the Old Grandfather Spirit, are propitiated with [[Sacrificial|offerings]]; each house has an ancestor [[altar]] at the back of the house.<ref>Durrenberger 1989</ref><ref>Bradley (1999), p. 89</ref><ref>Klein-Hutheesing 1990</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{further|Lisu language}}\nLinguistically, the Lisu belong to the [[Yi language|Yi]] or Nuosu branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.<ref>Bradley 2008</ref>\n\nThere are two scripts in use and the Chinese Department of Minorities publishes literature in both. The oldest and most widely used one is the [[Fraser alphabet]] developed about 1920 by [[James O. Fraser]] and the ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] evangelist Ba Thaw. The second script was developed by the Chinese government and is based on [[pinyin]].\n\nFraser's script for the Lisu language was used to prepare the first published works in Lisu which were a [[catechism]], portions of [[Bible|scripture]], and eventually, with much help from his colleagues, a complete [[New Testament]] in 1936. In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognized the Fraser alphabet as the official script of the Lisu language.<ref>{{cite web | title=Omniglot writing systems & languages of the world | work= Fraser alphabet| url= http://www.omniglot.com/writing/fraser.htm | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>\n\nOnly a small portion of Lisu are actually able to read or write the script,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} with most learning to read and write the local language (Chinese, Thai, Burmese) through primary education.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Art of Not Being Governed]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = David | last = Bradley | authorlink =  |date=November 1999 | title = Hill Tribes Phrasebook | publisher = Lonely Planet  | location = | isbn = 0-86442-635-6}}\n* {{cite book | first = David | last = Bradley | year = 2008 | title = Southern Lisu Dictionary | publisher = STEDT | isbn = 978-0-944613-43-6}}\n* Bradley, David, 1997.

As a private firm, ''InfoWars'' and its affiliated companies (\"a web of limited-liability companies\") are not required to make public financial statements, with the result observers can only estimate its revenue and profits.<ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/>\n\nPrior to 2013, Jones focused on building a \"media empire\".<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Seth |title=Alex Jones\u2019s Media Empire Is a Machine Built to Sell Snake-Oil Diet Supplements |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/how-does-alex-jones-make-money.html |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 4, 2017}}</ref> By 2013,  Alex Seitz-Wald of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' estimated that Jones was earning as much as [[USD|US$]]10 million a year between subscriptions, web and radio advertising, and sales of DVDs, T-shirts, and other merchandise.<ref name=\"salon\">{{cite web |last1=Sietz-Wald |first1=Alex |title=Alex Jones: Conspiracy Inc. |url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/02/alex_jones_conspiracy_inc/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=May 2, 2013}}</ref> That year, Jones changed his business model to incorporate selling proprietary dietary supplements, including one that promised to \"supercharge\" cognitive functions.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nUnlike most talk radio shows, ''InfoWars'' itself does not directly generate income. It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>  Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nThe diet supplement products sold on ''InfoWars'' are \"largely produced by Dr. Edward F.

It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>  Virtually all money is made by selling Jones' dietary supplements to viewers and listeners.<ref name=\"nym-brown-4-5-17\"/>\n\nThe diet supplement products sold on ''InfoWars'' are \"largely produced by Dr. Edward F.

In another part of the city, a deal is being made between a Westerner and an assassin. After the deal goes sour, the assassin kills the Westerner while the duo of Asprin (Mang Hoi) and Strepsil (John Shum) enter to pickpocket the Westerner and steal his passport. Unknown to all of them, the Westerner had secret [[microform|microfilm]] that contained details of a group of criminals involved in illegal activities, most notably the crooked businessman Mr. Tin. Inspector Ng arrives later and is heartbroken to discover that the dead man was Richard Nornen, with whom she was romantically involved.\n\nAfter authorities find out that Nornen had been working undercover and that the microfilm is missing, the Scottish investigator Carrie Morris (Cynthia Rothrock) is brought in to assist Ng in recovering it. The microfilm is in the possession of some petty thieves, whilst the police are looking for it to prove the guilt of Mr. Tin and his accomplices, who naturally want it destroyed. Meanwhile, Asprin and Strepsil return the passport to Panadol. Panadol sells the passport to a criminal who attempts to leave the country with it, but is thwarted by Morris, who halts him at the airport. Ng allows the criminal to leave but not on the plane, allowing both Morris and Ng to track down the source of the phony passport to Panadol. With Panadol in custody, he inadvertently mentions Asprin and Strepsil as accomplices.\n\nMr. Tin has the most to lose from the microfilm and sends three thugs to Asprin and Strepsil in order to get it from them. Strepsil admits defeat to them and gives over the microfilm. Ng and Morris then attempt to arrest Mr. Tin for possession of the item, but find that the microfilm in his possession is another one of Panadol's fakes and are unable to arrest him. Tin's thugs then manage to find Panadol but beat him so severely that he dies, while Asperin and Strepsil were going to sell the real microfilm for thousands of dollars. When Strepsil finds that Mr. Tin has the microfilm, Asperin and Strepsil, with the two police officers Morris and Ng closely following, arrive at Tin's house for a final showdown. During the battle, the microfilm is destroyed and Ng and Morris are about to be arrested for trespassing. Strepsil, who had just learned of Panadol's death, becomes enraged and grabs a police officer's gun and shoots Tin, who was about to go free because of the destruction of the evidence.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Shum]] as Strepsil\n*[[Michelle Yeoh]] as Senior Inspector Ng (as Michelle Khan)\n*[[Mang Hoi]] as Asprin\n*[[Cynthia Rothrock]] as Senior Inspector Carrie Morris\n*[[Tsui Hark]] as Panadol\n*[[Sammo Hung]] as Sifu\n*[[Richard Ng]] as Weak Heart\n*[[David Chiang]] as Sifu's roommate\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Policeman\n*[[Billy Lau]] as Parking Inspector\n*[[Dick Wei]] as Willie\n*[[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] as Henry Tin\n*[[Chung Fat]] as Big Moustache\n*[[Fruit Chan]] as Fruit\n*[[Chin Ka-lok]] as Henry's thug\n*[[Hsiao Ho]] as Henry's thug\n*[[Corey Yuen]] as Policeman\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| image1=Cynthia Rothrock 2018 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| alt1=Cynthia Rothrock in 2018\n| caption1=Cynthia Rothrock in 2018\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 *481/ 720) round 0}}\n\n| image2=Michelle Yeoh Cannes.jpg\n| alt2=Michelle Yeoh in 2007\n| caption2=Michelle Yeoh in 2007\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 *455 / 595) round 0}}\n\n| footer=''Yes, Madam'' was the debut film for [[Cynthia Rothrock]] and the first starring role in a feature film for [[Michelle Yeoh]].\n| footer_align=left\n}}\nWhile working a martial arts demonstration team, the magazine ''[[Inside Kung Fu]]'' contacted [[Cynthia Rothrock]]'s team stating that D & B Film was looking for a new male lead to play a [[Bruce Lee]]-esque character in a film.<ref name=\"Schubart145\">Schubart, 2007. p.145</ref> Despite looking for a male lead the team has a few women on their team and decided to bring them to demonstrate their skills as well.

In another part of the city, a deal is being made between a Westerner and an assassin. After the deal goes sour, the assassin kills the Westerner while the duo of Asprin (Mang Hoi) and Strepsil (John Shum) enter to pickpocket the Westerner and steal his passport. Unknown to all of them, the Westerner had secret [[microform|microfilm]] that contained details of a group of criminals involved in illegal activities, most notably the crooked businessman Mr. Tin. Inspector Ng arrives later and is heartbroken to discover that the dead man was Richard Nornen, with whom she was romantically involved.\n\nAfter authorities find out that Nornen had been working undercover and that the microfilm is missing, the Scottish investigator Carrie Morris (Cynthia Rothrock) is brought in to assist Ng in recovering it. The microfilm is in the possession of some petty thieves, whilst the police are looking for it to prove the guilt of Mr. Tin and his accomplices, who naturally want it destroyed. Meanwhile, Asprin and Strepsil return the passport to Panadol. Panadol sells the passport to a criminal who attempts to leave the country with it, but is thwarted by Morris, who halts him at the airport. Ng allows the criminal to leave but not on the plane, allowing both Morris and Ng to track down the source of the phony passport to Panadol. With Panadol in custody, he inadvertently mentions Asprin and Strepsil as accomplices.\n\nMr. Tin has the most to lose from the microfilm and sends three thugs to Asprin and Strepsil in order to get it from them. Strepsil admits defeat to them and gives over the microfilm. Ng and Morris then attempt to arrest Mr. Tin for possession of the item, but find that the microfilm in his possession is another one of Panadol's fakes and are unable to arrest him. Tin's thugs then manage to find Panadol but beat him so severely that he dies, while Asperin and Strepsil were going to sell the real microfilm for thousands of dollars. When Strepsil finds that Mr. Tin has the microfilm, Asperin and Strepsil, with the two police officers Morris and Ng closely following, arrive at Tin's house for a final showdown. During the battle, the microfilm is destroyed and Ng and Morris are about to be arrested for trespassing. Strepsil, who had just learned of Panadol's death, becomes enraged and grabs a police officer's gun and shoots Tin, who was about to go free because of the destruction of the evidence.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Shum]] as Strepsil\n*[[Michelle Yeoh]] as Senior Inspector Ng (as Michelle Khan)\n*[[Mang Hoi]] as Asprin\n*[[Cynthia Rothrock]] as Senior Inspector Carrie Morris\n*[[Tsui Hark]] as Panadol\n*[[Sammo Hung]] as Sifu\n*[[Richard Ng]] as Weak Heart\n*[[David Chiang]] as Sifu's roommate\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Policeman\n*[[Billy Lau]] as Parking Inspector\n*[[Dick Wei]] as Willie\n*[[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] as Henry Tin\n*[[Chung Fat]] as Big Moustache\n*[[Fruit Chan]] as Fruit\n*[[Chin Ka-lok]] as Henry's thug\n*[[Hsiao Ho]] as Henry's thug\n*[[Corey Yuen]] as Policeman\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| image1=Cynthia Rothrock 2018 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| alt1=Cynthia Rothrock in 2018\n| caption1=Cynthia Rothrock in 2018\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 *481/ 720) round 0}}\n\n| image2=Michelle Yeoh Cannes.jpg\n| alt2=Michelle Yeoh in 2007\n| caption2=Michelle Yeoh in 2007\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 *455 / 595) round 0}}\n\n| footer=''Yes, Madam'' was the debut film for [[Cynthia Rothrock]] and the first starring role in a feature film for [[Michelle Yeoh]].\n| footer_align=left\n}}\nWhile working a martial arts demonstration team, the magazine ''[[Inside Kung Fu]]'' contacted [[Cynthia Rothrock]]'s team stating that D & B Film was looking for a new male lead to play a [[Bruce Lee]]-esque character in a film.<ref name=\"Schubart145\">Schubart, 2007. p.145</ref> Despite looking for a male lead the team has a few women on their team and decided to bring them to demonstrate their skills as well.
