S. Ravikumar]] and written by [[Crazy Mohan]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]] in the title role, while [[Jayaram]], [[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]] and [[Jyothika]] did the supporting roles. The film's music was composed by [[A. R. Rahman]]. The film's cinematography and editing was handled by Priyan and K. Thanigachalam respectively.\n\nThe film revolves around a senior psychiatrist who is jealous of his junior doctor Kailash getting all attention sends Thenali Soman, a disturbed Sri Lankan Tamil to prove his methods a failure. Kailash who is annoyed by the presence of Thenali tries various ways to throw him out of home, the rest of the film shows whether he succeeds or not.\n\nThe film opened in 26 October 2000 to positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success at the Tamil Nadu box-office. The film won three [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], including a [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize|Special Jury]] award for Jayaram's performance as Dr. Kailash. The story of the film was inspired by the <abbr>1991</abbr> American film ''[[What About Bob?]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThenali Soman is a [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil]] refugee who has come to [[Chennai]] for psychiatric treatment. This is because of numerous [[phobia]]s he has developed due to the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Panchabhootham and his assistant, the doctors treating Thenali, are jealous of a relatively junior doctor Kailash getting all the media attention. They send Thenali over to him, believing his failure to cure Thenali of his phobias will derail his success. Soon after their first appointment, Kailash heads to his home in [[Kodaikanal]] on a vacation with his wife Jalaja and his two children Arjun and Aishwarya. Kailash tells Thenali to wait until after the vacation before his therapy can begin, but Panchabhootham asks for Thenali to go meet Kailash while on vacation.\n\nRajinikanth played a supporting role.\n\nThenali reaches Kailash's Kodaikanal home. He falls in love with Janaki, Kailash's younger sister, which is vehemently opposed by the latter. The whole film is about how Kailash goes mad with Thenali's antics and even begins to suspect that his wife has an affair with Thenali, as she has a soft corner for the latter. He even tries to kill Thenali by tying him to a tree with a [[time bomb]]. Thenali, thinking it is a fake bomb used only to relieve him from his fears, removes it and puts it in Kailash's house where it explodes. Seeing this, Kailash suffers a paralytic attack. Thenali later marries Janaki.\n\nWhile Thenali, Kailash, and family are at a picnic, Thenali's long-lost wife shows up and reunites with him. Enraged, Kailash jumps out of his wheelchair and berates Thenali for ruining Janaki's life, but soon realises this was all a set-up by Thenali to cure Kailash's paralysis through [[Shock therapy (psychiatry)|shock treatment]], which succeeded; the woman was actually actress [[Meena (actress)|Meena]], who Thenali hired to pose as his wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Thenali Soman\n* [[Jayaram]] as Kailash\n* [[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]] as Jalaja\n* [[Jyothika]] as Janaki\n* [[Delhi Ganesh]] as Dr. Panchabhootham\n* [[Charle]] as Guide Kanthaswamy\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Dr. Panchabhootham's assistant\n* [[Madhan Bob]] as \"Diamond\" Babu\n* Master Suraj as Arjun, Kailash's son\n* Baby Taj Nisha as Aishwarya, Kailash's daughter\n* [[Crane Manohar]] as Servant\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Raj TV Reporter\n* Bayilvan Ranganathan as Inspector\n* [[Meena Durairaj|Meena]] as Meena (cameo)\n* [[C.

Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009. And in December, 2009, Mexican Marines killed Arturo Beltran Leyva after he\u2019d barricaded himself into an apartment in an upscale neighborhood in Cuernavaca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozlibre.com/noticias/ampliar/29927/arturo-beltran-leyva-resucita-en-sus-fotos-mas-sangrientas|title=Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva resucita en sus fotos m\u00e1s sangrientas|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 was even worse for the BLO.

Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009.

That year, the Royals selected Gordon with the second overall pick in the [[2005 MLB Draft]]. Gordon made his major league debut in 2007 as a [[third baseman]], but had an inconsistent beginning to his career.  In 2010, the Royals demoted Gordon to the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] for a substantial period of time, and moved Gordon from third base to [[outfielder|the outfield]].  He returned to the Royals later that season as a full-time outfielder, and his play improved substantially.  A member of the Royals' [[2015 World Series]] championship team, Gordon signed a four-year [[free agent]] contract that offseason to remain with the team. Gordon has won seven [[Gold Glove Award]]s, four [[Fielding Bible Award]]s, and a [[Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award]], all after the move to the outfield.\n\n==Early life==\nGordon was born on February 10, 1984, to a family heavily involved in baseball.

In 2010, the Royals demoted Gordon to the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] for a substantial period of time, and moved Gordon from third base to [[outfielder|the outfield]].  He returned to the Royals later that season as a full-time outfielder, and his play improved substantially.  A member of the Royals' [[2015 World Series]] championship team, Gordon signed a four-year [[free agent]] contract that offseason to remain with the team.
