The books revolve around the adventures of the skeleton detective, Skulduggery Pleasant, his proteg\u00e9, Valkyrie Cain, along with other friends. The central [[story arc]] concerns Valkyrie's struggle to stop evil forces threatening the world and her internal struggle to resist the darkness within.\n\nSince the release of the first novel in 2007, ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]'', the series has been praised by both readers and critics. The following novels were released each year afterward, with the exception of the fourth and fifth novels, ''Dark Days'' and ''Mortal Coil'', which were both released in 2010. Landy was initially contracted to write three books, with any further books depending on how well the first trilogy sold. The success of the first novels ensured that the deal was extended first to six books and in 2011, HarperCollins signed the deal for the final trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/harpercollins-extends-landy-deal.html|title=HarperCollins extends Landy deal|publisher=The Bookseller|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Derek Landy announced via a video blog that although the ''Skulduggery Pleasant'' series was complete, the series as a whole was still set to continue with a sequel series, the first book of which was released on 1 June 2017, titled ''Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dereklandy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/new-book-announcement.html|title=Derek Landy Blogs Under Duress: New Book Announcement|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Untitled-Skulduggery-Pleasant-Book-10-Derek-Landy/0008169020/ref=as_li_ss_tl|title=Resurrection (Skulduggery Pleasant, Book 10)|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>  On 6 April 2020, ''Seasons of War'', the first book of the second (and final) trilogy in the second series, was released.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall=5 |title=40 |airdate=20 |altdate=20 |aux4=15 |airdateT=Publication date |altdateT=Counts |aux4T=ISBN |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|c=#93B8C4|p=First series|nopart=y}}\n{{Book list\n | book_number   = 1\n | title         = [[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]\n | publish_date  = 3 April 2007\n | aux1          = 67,393 words<ref name=\"PageCounts\">{{cite tweet |user=DerekLandy |author=Derek Landy |number=1007252922076422144 |title=I don't know the page counts, because to all depends on how big the font size is when the books are printed, but I do keep track of word counts.

Pleasant''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)}}\n\nTwelve-year-old Stephanie Edgley is tired of her boring and miserable life. But when a mysterious man breaks into her recently inherited uncle's house and tries to kill her, she is saved by a funny, arrogant, fireball-throwing, 400-year-old detective that goes by the name of Skulduggery Pleasant, who just so happens to be a walking, talking skeleton, and she is pulled with him to a secret world of danger, murder and magic. Later in the book, taking the new name of Valkyrie Cain, Stephanie partners up with Skulduggery to solve her uncle's murder, meeting all types of people along the way, to prevent the devious Nefarian Serpine from obtaining the Sceptre of Ancients, a mystical weapon that can slay gods. The Sceptre is a powerful weapon which can be used to defeat and overcome the world and bring back the Faceless Ones.\n\n===''Playing with Fire''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Playing with Fire}}\nBaron Vengeous, one of Mevolent's Three Generals, has escaped from prison, and he has big plans for the Grotesquery, a dark creature created from the remains of some of the most deadly creatures to ever walk the earth. Most worryingly of all, it had the torso of a Faceless One, one of the dark gods that ruled the earth eons ago, and Baron plans to use this to bring back the rest of the Faceless Ones, so they may resume their reign of tyranny and torture, and to help him with this endeavour he has an army of vampires at his disposal. This will be Skulduggery and Valkyrie's toughest battle yet.\n\n===''The Faceless Ones''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Faceless Ones}}\nAs a number of teleporters are mysteriously murdered Valkyrie and Skulduggery learn that it is quickly linked to a fanatical cult named the Diablerie, who worship horrific Dark gods known as the Faceless Ones, as they attempt to open a portal with the goal of returning the Faceless Ones to the world. With the assistance of a cocky young teleporter, Fletcher Renn, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have very little time to track down a mysterious man named Batu, stop the Diablerie, and prevent the Faceless ones from returning to earth, because if they don't, the world will burn. This one will have deadly consequences.\n\n===''Dark Days''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Dark Days}}\nFollowing the events of ''The Faceless Ones'', Valkyrie has tracked down Skulduggery's original skull, with which she can open another portal to the home dimension of the Faceless Ones and rescue Skulduggery. However, things do not go exactly as planned as Skulduggery has become unhinged thanks to his experiences with the Faceless Ones, but it is quickly revealed that they have much bigger problems to worry about: The Revengers Club, a group of criminals and murderers (and Scapegrace), who are out for revenge against those who wronged them in the way they know best: mass murder. And if that wasn't enough to deal with, sensitives all around the globe are having visions of a new threat, one that will bring the world to its knees: Darquesse.\n\n===''Mortal Coil''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Mortal Coil}}\nBetween the shocking revelation that her true name is Darquesse, a near deathly being that Sensitives have had terrifying apocalyptic visions of, in which she turns the world into a charred lifeless husk, an outbreak of at least 2000 vicious, soul possessing shadows known as Remnants who turn their hosts into murdering psychopaths with no remorse, and a prophecy which may make her the Death Bringer, a messiah to the necromancers who they believe will be their salvation, Valkyrie Cain has a lot to worry about. And this time, she doesn't come out completely victorious.\n\n===''Death Bringer''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Death Bringer}}\nThe Death Bringer has finally arrived, and she has brought with her an eagerness to end the world as we know it, and initiate the Passage, a secretive ritual which necromancers refuse to explain to the rest of the magical community, only that it will 'tear down the barriers between life and death'. But when the horrific truth behind the Passage is revealed, Valkyrie and Skulduggery are caught up in a hectic race against time to save half of the world's population from an untimely death, a race that will have both Skulduggery and Valkyrie facing their inner demons.\n\n===''Kingdom of the Wicked''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Kingdom of the Wicked}}\nMortals all throughout the world are inexplicably obtaining magical powers, and the trail seems to lead to Argeddion, a pacifistic, almost god like being, who, with the knowledge of his true name, hopes to bring magic to the masses, and lift the world into a new era of enlightenment and peace. The only problem with his seemingly idyllic plan: many of his test subjects are running wild, drunk on their newfound power, and are slaughtering innocent people and on the verge of exposing magic to the world. All of this poses a credible challenge to Skulduggery and Valkyrie. They also have the Supreme Council to deal with, an allied group of sanctuaries trying to convince the Irish to hand over control after the recent series of catastrophes. To make things worse, Valkyrie starts having uncontrollable trans-dimensional jaunts to a world controlled by sorcerers, where mortals live in terror and Mevolent still lives.\n\n===''Last Stand of Dead Men''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Last Stand of Dead Men}}\nThe war between sanctuaries of the magical world that everyone has been expecting has finally come, with the Supreme Council making a desperate grab for the complete control of the cradle of magic, sparking a brutal war that will turn friend into enemy, and ally to foe. But even as the Dead Men make their final stand for their country and their freedom, there is another war raging, inside Valkyrie Cain herself, and it is much more important. Because if she loses, Darquesse will rise, the world will burn, and everyone she knows and loves will perish.\n\n===''The Dying of the Light''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Dying of the Light}}\nThe final book of the first series. The War of the Sanctuaries has been won, but it was not without its casualties. Rogue supercharged sorcerers from the battle of Roarhaven are running loose. Following Valkyrie's becoming of Darquesse, Skulduggery Pleasant must use any and all means to track down and stop Darquesse and hopefully free Valkyrie before she turns the world into a charred, lifeless cinder. And so he draws together a team of soldiers, monster hunters, killers, criminals, and Valkyrie's own murderous and sentient reflection.\n\n==Second series novels==\n\n===''Resurrection''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Resurrection}}\nA lot has changed. Roarhaven is now a magical city, where sorcerers can live openly. Valkyrie Cain has been out of action for years, recovering from the war against her alter-ego Darquesse, which nearly destroyed her and everyone else. Some things never change, though: bad people still want to do bad things, and Skulduggery Pleasant is still there to stop them. When Skulduggery learns of a plot to resurrect a terrifying evil, he persuades Valkyrie to join him for just 24 hours. But they need someone else on their team, someone inconspicuous, someone who can go undercover: Omen Darkly, a student at the new Corrival Academy, a school for the magically gifted.\n\n===''Midnight''===\n\nValkyrie has struggled to keep her family safe ever since she became a sorcerer, while she battled alongside Skulduggery and returned victorious every time. However, a killer kidnaps Alice, her little sister, to force Valkyrie into a final battle. Valkyrie is joined by Skulduggery and Omen Darkly, to find Alice within twelve hours, before it's too late.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/l/derek-landy/midnight.htm|title=Synopsis of Midnight|work=FantasticFiction.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Bedlam''===\n\nReeling from the aftermath of Alice's kidnapping, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have their hands full with new violent visions of the future, while Valkyrie works tirelessly to find her sister's soul, conspiracies in the American government, and tracking down old enemies while facing newer, greater threats than ever. With the King of the Darklands on the rise, and the Anti-sanctuary moving into their endgame, it will take Valkyrie, Skulduggery, the Darkly brothers, and all the allies they can muster to face what lies in store. If new secrets and revelations don't tear them apart first.\n\n===''Seasons of War''===\nWar is coming. To avert catastrophe, Skulduggery and Valkyrie are sent on a secret mission that takes them away from everything they know, to a forsaken land of magic and grim, unrelenting terror. It is here that Valkyrie will have to fight the hardest \u2014 not only against the enemies who want her dead, but also against her own self-destructive impulses. It's only by crawling through darkness that she'll be able to once again stand in the light... Set from spring to summer, Seasons of War takes place over 7 months, and in another dimension. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith, Dexter, Saracen and Nefarian Serpine from Dimension X find that Mevolent's dimension is overrun by zombie like people who have been infected by a disease and are called Draugar.\n\n''Seasons of War'' released on 2 April 2020, and is be the first novel in the final trilogy of the second series.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\">{{cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/seasons-of-war/derek-landy/9780008386238|website=Waterstones|title=Seasons of War by Derek Landy}}</ref><ref name=\"Seasons of War\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1189890476767371264|title=Derek Landy on Twitter: \"#Skulduggery13|first=Derek|last=Landy|date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1198171319952650241|title=Nope!

There's nothing worthy about it, and it's all the better for that. And, I might add, it's self-contained. Landy may well revisit these characters \u2013 I sincerely hope he does \u2013 but it's a pleasingly rounded tale, which is refreshing in these days of endless open-ended books of never-ending series.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/childrenandteens/0,,2051807,00.html|title=Review at The Guardian | location=London | first=Philip|last=Ardagh|date=7 April 2007}}</ref>\n* Nathan Nicholls ([[Whitby Gazette]]):\n: ''There is no expense spared by Landy in this book and I would have to say that everyone who could be bothered to read it, would definitely be drawn into it and certainly enjoy it.

The books revolve around the adventures of the skeleton detective, Skulduggery Pleasant, his proteg\u00e9, Valkyrie Cain, along with other friends. The central [[story arc]] concerns Valkyrie's struggle to stop evil forces threatening the world and her internal struggle to resist the darkness within.\n\nSince the release of the first novel in 2007, ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]'', the series has been praised by both readers and critics. The following novels were released each year afterward, with the exception of the fourth and fifth novels, ''Dark Days'' and ''Mortal Coil'', which were both released in 2010. Landy was initially contracted to write three books, with any further books depending on how well the first trilogy sold. The success of the first novels ensured that the deal was extended first to six books and in 2011, HarperCollins signed the deal for the final trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/harpercollins-extends-landy-deal.html|title=HarperCollins extends Landy deal|publisher=The Bookseller|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Derek Landy announced via a video blog that although the ''Skulduggery Pleasant'' series was complete, the series as a whole was still set to continue with a sequel series, the first book of which was released on 1 June 2017, titled ''Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dereklandy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/new-book-announcement.html|title=Derek Landy Blogs Under Duress: New Book Announcement|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Untitled-Skulduggery-Pleasant-Book-10-Derek-Landy/0008169020/ref=as_li_ss_tl|title=Resurrection (Skulduggery Pleasant, Book 10)|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>  On 6 April 2020, ''Seasons of War'', the first book of the second (and final) trilogy in the second series, was released.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones />\n\n==Summary==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall=5 |title=40 |airdate=20 |altdate=20 |aux4=15 |airdateT=Publication date |altdateT=Counts |aux4T=ISBN |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|c=#93B8C4|p=First series|nopart=y}}\n{{Book list\n | book_number   = 1\n | title         = [[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]\n | publish_date  = 3 April 2007\n | aux1          = 67,393 words<ref name=\"PageCounts\">{{cite tweet |user=DerekLandy |author=Derek Landy |number=1007252922076422144 |title=I don't know the page counts, because to all depends on how big the font size is when the books are printed, but I do keep track of word counts.

But when a mysterious man breaks into her recently inherited uncle's house and tries to kill her, she is saved by a funny, arrogant, fireball-throwing, 400-year-old detective that goes by the name of Skulduggery Pleasant, who just so happens to be a walking, talking skeleton, and she is pulled with him to a secret world of danger, murder and magic. Later in the book, taking the new name of Valkyrie Cain, Stephanie partners up with Skulduggery to solve her uncle's murder, meeting all types of people along the way, to prevent the devious Nefarian Serpine from obtaining the Sceptre of Ancients, a mystical weapon that can slay gods. The Sceptre is a powerful weapon which can be used to defeat and overcome the world and bring back the Faceless Ones.\n\n===''Playing with Fire''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Playing with Fire}}\nBaron Vengeous, one of Mevolent's Three Generals, has escaped from prison, and he has big plans for the Grotesquery, a dark creature created from the remains of some of the most deadly creatures to ever walk the earth. Most worryingly of all, it had the torso of a Faceless One, one of the dark gods that ruled the earth eons ago, and Baron plans to use this to bring back the rest of the Faceless Ones, so they may resume their reign of tyranny and torture, and to help him with this endeavour he has an army of vampires at his disposal. This will be Skulduggery and Valkyrie's toughest battle yet.\n\n===''The Faceless Ones''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Faceless Ones}}\nAs a number of teleporters are mysteriously murdered Valkyrie and Skulduggery learn that it is quickly linked to a fanatical cult named the Diablerie, who worship horrific Dark gods known as the Faceless Ones, as they attempt to open a portal with the goal of returning the Faceless Ones to the world. With the assistance of a cocky young teleporter, Fletcher Renn, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have very little time to track down a mysterious man named Batu, stop the Diablerie, and prevent the Faceless ones from returning to earth, because if they don't, the world will burn. This one will have deadly consequences.\n\n===''Dark Days''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Dark Days}}\nFollowing the events of ''The Faceless Ones'', Valkyrie has tracked down Skulduggery's original skull, with which she can open another portal to the home dimension of the Faceless Ones and rescue Skulduggery. However, things do not go exactly as planned as Skulduggery has become unhinged thanks to his experiences with the Faceless Ones, but it is quickly revealed that they have much bigger problems to worry about: The Revengers Club, a group of criminals and murderers (and Scapegrace), who are out for revenge against those who wronged them in the way they know best: mass murder. And if that wasn't enough to deal with, sensitives all around the globe are having visions of a new threat, one that will bring the world to its knees: Darquesse.\n\n===''Mortal Coil''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Mortal Coil}}\nBetween the shocking revelation that her true name is Darquesse, a near deathly being that Sensitives have had terrifying apocalyptic visions of, in which she turns the world into a charred lifeless husk, an outbreak of at least 2000 vicious, soul possessing shadows known as Remnants who turn their hosts into murdering psychopaths with no remorse, and a prophecy which may make her the Death Bringer, a messiah to the necromancers who they believe will be their salvation, Valkyrie Cain has a lot to worry about. And this time, she doesn't come out completely victorious.\n\n===''Death Bringer''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Death Bringer}}\nThe Death Bringer has finally arrived, and she has brought with her an eagerness to end the world as we know it, and initiate the Passage, a secretive ritual which necromancers refuse to explain to the rest of the magical community, only that it will 'tear down the barriers between life and death'. But when the horrific truth behind the Passage is revealed, Valkyrie and Skulduggery are caught up in a hectic race against time to save half of the world's population from an untimely death, a race that will have both Skulduggery and Valkyrie facing their inner demons.\n\n===''Kingdom of the Wicked''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Kingdom of the Wicked}}\nMortals all throughout the world are inexplicably obtaining magical powers, and the trail seems to lead to Argeddion, a pacifistic, almost god like being, who, with the knowledge of his true name, hopes to bring magic to the masses, and lift the world into a new era of enlightenment and peace. The only problem with his seemingly idyllic plan: many of his test subjects are running wild, drunk on their newfound power, and are slaughtering innocent people and on the verge of exposing magic to the world. All of this poses a credible challenge to Skulduggery and Valkyrie. They also have the Supreme Council to deal with, an allied group of sanctuaries trying to convince the Irish to hand over control after the recent series of catastrophes. To make things worse, Valkyrie starts having uncontrollable trans-dimensional jaunts to a world controlled by sorcerers, where mortals live in terror and Mevolent still lives.\n\n===''Last Stand of Dead Men''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Last Stand of Dead Men}}\nThe war between sanctuaries of the magical world that everyone has been expecting has finally come, with the Supreme Council making a desperate grab for the complete control of the cradle of magic, sparking a brutal war that will turn friend into enemy, and ally to foe. But even as the Dead Men make their final stand for their country and their freedom, there is another war raging, inside Valkyrie Cain herself, and it is much more important. Because if she loses, Darquesse will rise, the world will burn, and everyone she knows and loves will perish.\n\n===''The Dying of the Light''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Dying of the Light}}\nThe final book of the first series. The War of the Sanctuaries has been won, but it was not without its casualties. Rogue supercharged sorcerers from the battle of Roarhaven are running loose. Following Valkyrie's becoming of Darquesse, Skulduggery Pleasant must use any and all means to track down and stop Darquesse and hopefully free Valkyrie before she turns the world into a charred, lifeless cinder. And so he draws together a team of soldiers, monster hunters, killers, criminals, and Valkyrie's own murderous and sentient reflection.\n\n==Second series novels==\n\n===''Resurrection''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Resurrection}}\nA lot has changed. Roarhaven is now a magical city, where sorcerers can live openly. Valkyrie Cain has been out of action for years, recovering from the war against her alter-ego Darquesse, which nearly destroyed her and everyone else. Some things never change, though: bad people still want to do bad things, and Skulduggery Pleasant is still there to stop them. When Skulduggery learns of a plot to resurrect a terrifying evil, he persuades Valkyrie to join him for just 24 hours. But they need someone else on their team, someone inconspicuous, someone who can go undercover: Omen Darkly, a student at the new Corrival Academy, a school for the magically gifted.\n\n===''Midnight''===\n\nValkyrie has struggled to keep her family safe ever since she became a sorcerer, while she battled alongside Skulduggery and returned victorious every time. However, a killer kidnaps Alice, her little sister, to force Valkyrie into a final battle. Valkyrie is joined by Skulduggery and Omen Darkly, to find Alice within twelve hours, before it's too late.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/l/derek-landy/midnight.htm|title=Synopsis of Midnight|work=FantasticFiction.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Bedlam''===\n\nReeling from the aftermath of Alice's kidnapping, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have their hands full with new violent visions of the future, while Valkyrie works tirelessly to find her sister's soul, conspiracies in the American government, and tracking down old enemies while facing newer, greater threats than ever. With the King of the Darklands on the rise, and the Anti-sanctuary moving into their endgame, it will take Valkyrie, Skulduggery, the Darkly brothers, and all the allies they can muster to face what lies in store. If new secrets and revelations don't tear them apart first.\n\n===''Seasons of War''===\nWar is coming. To avert catastrophe, Skulduggery and Valkyrie are sent on a secret mission that takes them away from everything they know, to a forsaken land of magic and grim, unrelenting terror. It is here that Valkyrie will have to fight the hardest \u2014 not only against the enemies who want her dead, but also against her own self-destructive impulses. It's only by crawling through darkness that she'll be able to once again stand in the light... Set from spring to summer, Seasons of War takes place over 7 months, and in another dimension. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith, Dexter, Saracen and Nefarian Serpine from Dimension X find that Mevolent's dimension is overrun by zombie like people who have been infected by a disease and are called Draugar. \n\n''Seasons of War'' released on 2 April 2020, and is be the first novel in the final trilogy of the second series.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\">{{cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/seasons-of-war/derek-landy/9780008386238|website=Waterstones|title=Seasons of War by Derek Landy}}</ref><ref name=\"Seasons of War\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1189890476767371264|title=Derek Landy on Twitter: \"#Skulduggery13|first=Derek|last=Landy|date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1198171319952650241|title=Nope!

Many critics praised [[Derek Landy]]'s way of writing due to his large gallery of [[List of characters in Skulduggery Pleasant|characters]].\n* Phillip Ardagh ([[The Guardian]]):\n: ''It's exciting, pacy, nicely handled and it's fun. There's nothing worthy about it, and it's all the better for that. And, I might add, it's self-contained. Landy may well revisit these characters \u2013 I sincerely hope he does \u2013 but it's a pleasingly rounded tale, which is refreshing in these days of endless open-ended books of never-ending series.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/childrenandteens/0,,2051807,00.html|title=Review at The Guardian | location=London | first=Philip|last=Ardagh|date=7 April 2007}}</ref>\n* Nathan Nicholls ([[Whitby Gazette]]):\n: ''There is no expense spared by Landy in this book and I would have to say that everyone who could be bothered to read it, would definitely be drawn into it and certainly enjoy it.

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spin-offs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''.

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spin-offs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household.

Similar to ''[[Cave Kids]]'', the show focuses on the lives of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, who are joined by Dino for many adventures in the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amidi |first1=Amid |title=Boomerang Announces 2 New Streaming Series: \u2018Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!\u2019 and \u2018Scooby-Doo And Guess Who?\u2019 |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/internet-television/boomerang-announces-2-new-streaming-series-yabba-dabba-dinosaurs-and-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-158604.html |accessdate=16 March 2020 |work=Cartoon Brew |date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies.
