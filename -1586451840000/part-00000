Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people.

The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player.

In order to keep the library open, they would rotate services during the days of the week, each service offered on a particular day of the week.  The library ended up closing to the public after donating all of its inventory to the local high school to help them meet their requirements to the students.  In 1954, the Business and Professional Women's Club assisted the Women's Club to re-establish the public library, and it is thriving today.\n\n*[http://www.cityofmaryesther.com/186/Library Mary Esther Public Library]\nThe Mary Esther Public Library was first proposed in 1974 and was approved, taking up only a space of 585 square feet.

In 2004, the library was expanded and it thrives today serving the citizens of Mary Esther, FL and Okaloosa County.\n\n*[https://cityofniceville.org/169/Library Niceville Library]\nThe Niceville Library became a part of the library cooperative in 1997 in Okaloosa County.
