Jackson Sr., was a [[stevedore]] (dockworker) and a barber who later became a Baptist minister. He fathered five other children besides Mahalia: Wilmon (older) and then Yvonne, Edna, Pearl and Johnny Jr. (by his marriage shortly after Halie's birth). Her father's sister, Jeanette Jackson-Burnett, and her husband, Josie, were vaudeville entertainers.

She was the main attraction in the first gospel music showcase at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1957, which was organized by Joe Bostic and recorded by the [[Voice of America]] and performed again in 1958 (''Newport 1958''). She was also present at the opening night of Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] in December 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-25/news/0711230245_1_folk-music-ballads-sang|title=Studs recalls how 1 man's dream became a reality|first=Studs|last=Terkel|authorlink=Studs Terkel|date=November 25, 2007|accessdate=November 23, 2010|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> In 1961, she sang at [[John F.

By this time, she had also become a familiar face to British television viewers as a result of short films of her performing that were occasionally shown.\n\nAt the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963, Jackson sang in front of 250,000 people \"[[How I Got Over]]\" and \"I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned\".<ref name=obit/> [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech there.

In 1970, she performed for Liberian President [[William Tubman]].\n\nJackson's last album was ''What The World Needs Now'' (1969). The next year, in 1970, she and [[Louis Armstrong]] performed \"[[Just a Closer Walk with Thee]]\" and \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]\" together. She ended her career in 1971 with a concert in [[Germany]], and when she returned to the U.S., made one of her final television appearances on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. She devoted much of her time and energy to helping others. She established the Mahalia Jackson Scholarship Foundation for young people who wanted to attend college. For her efforts in helping international understanding, she received the Silver Dove Award. Chicago remained her home until the end of her life. She opened a beauty parlor and a florist shop with her earnings, while also investing in real estate ($100,000 a year at her peak).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905760,00.html |title=Moving On Up |work=Time |date=February 7, 1972 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, she guest-starred on episode 56 of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', singing \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\", followed by [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Gordon Robinson]] (played by [[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]]) finding hidden E's.\n\n===Civil rights movement===\nJackson played an important role during the [[civil rights movement]]. In August 1956, she met [[Ralph Abernathy]] and Martin Luther King, Jr., at the National Baptist Convention.<ref name=\"MJ MLK Stanford\" /><ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\">{{cite book|last=Kramer|first=Barbara|title=Mahalia Jackson: The Voice of Gospel and Civil Rights|year=2003|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, New Jersey|isbn=0766021157}}</ref> A few months later, both King and Abernathy contacted her about coming to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to sing at a rally to raise money for the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|bus boycott]]. They also hoped she would inspire the people who were getting discouraged with the boycott.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nDespite death threats, Jackson agreed to sing in Montgomery. Her concert was on December 6, 1956. By then, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that bus segregation was unconstitutional. In Montgomery, the ruling was not yet put into effect, so the bus boycott continued. At this concert she sang \"[[I've Heard of a City Called Heaven]]\", \"[[Move On Up a Little Higher]]\" and \"[[Silent Night]]\". There was a good turnout at the concert and they were happy with the amount of money raised. However, when she returned to the Abernathy's home, it had been bombed. The boycott finally ended on December 21, 1956, when federal injunctions were served, forcing Montgomery to comply with the court ruling.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nAlthough Jackson was internationally known and had moved up to the northern states, she still encountered racial prejudice. One account of this was when she tried to buy a house in Chicago. Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nKing and Abernathy continued to protest segregation. In 1957, they founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The first major event sponsored by the SCLC was the [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]] in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1957, the third anniversary of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" /> From this point forward, Jackson appeared often with King, singing before his speeches and for SCLC fundraisers. In a 1962 SCLC press release, he wrote she had \"appeared on numerous programs that helped the struggle in the South, but now she has indicated that she wants to be involved on a regular basis\".<ref name=\"MJ MLK Stanford\" /> [[Jesse Jackson]] said when King called on her, she never refused, traveling with him to the deepest parts of the segregated South.<ref name=\"NPR MJ\">{{cite web|last=Glinton|first=Sonari|title=Mahalia Jackson: Voice Of The Civil Rights Movement|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123498527|work=[[50 great voices|50 Great Voices]]|publisher=NPR|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963, Jackson performed \"I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned\", before King  gave his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech.

Among her surviving relatives are her great-nephews, former NBA basketball player [[Danny Granger]] and soul artist [[Scotty Granger]].\n\nJackson's estate was reported at more than four million dollars. Some reporters estimated record royalties, television and movie residuals, and various investments made it worth more. The bulk of the estate was left to a number of relatives, many of whom cared for her during her early years. Among principal heirs were relatives including her half-brother, John Jackson, and aunt, Hannah Robinson. Neither of her ex-husbands, Isaac Hockenhull (1936\u20131941) nor Sigmund Galloway (1964\u20131967), was mentioned in her will.<ref>''Ebony'', April 1972.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\nJackson's music was played widely on gospel and [[Christian radio station]]s, such as [[Family Radio]].

A New History of Black Gospel Music'', New York: Continuum (2004), p. 220. {{ISBN|0-8264-1436-2}}.</ref> She was a close friend of [[Doris Akers]], one of the most prolific gospel composers of the 20th century. In 1958, they cowrote the hit \"Lord, Don't Move the Mountain\". Mahalia also sang many of Akers' own compositions such as \"God Is So Good to Me\", \"God Spoke to Me One Day\", \"Trouble\", \"Lead On, Lord Jesus\" and \"He's a Light Unto My Pathway\", helping Akers to secure her position as the leading female Gospel composer of that time. In addition to her singing career, she mentored the legendary soul singer [[Aretha Franklin]]. Jackson was also good friends with [[Dorothy Norwood]] and fellow Chicago-based gospel singer [[Albertina Walker]], and she discovered a young [[Della Reese]]. On the 20th anniversary of her death, [[Smithsonian Folkways]] Recording commemorated her with the album ''I Sing Because I'm Happy'', which includes interviews about her childhood conducted by [[Jules Scherwin]].\n\n''[[American Idol]]'' winner and [[Grammy Award]]-winning R&B singer [[Fantasia Barrino]] has been cast to play Jackson in a biographical film about her life.

In August 1956, she met [[Ralph Abernathy]] and Martin Luther King, Jr., at the National Baptist Convention.<ref name=\"MJ MLK Stanford\" /><ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\">{{cite book|last=Kramer|first=Barbara|title=Mahalia Jackson: The Voice of Gospel and Civil Rights|year=2003|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, New Jersey|isbn=0766021157}}</ref> A few months later, both King and Abernathy contacted her about coming to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to sing at a rally to raise money for the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|bus boycott]]. They also hoped she would inspire the people who were getting discouraged with the boycott.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nDespite death threats, Jackson agreed to sing in Montgomery. Her concert was on December 6, 1956. By then, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that bus segregation was unconstitutional. In Montgomery, the ruling was not yet put into effect, so the bus boycott continued. At this concert she sang \"[[I've Heard of a City Called Heaven]]\", \"[[Move On Up a Little Higher]]\" and \"[[Silent Night]]\". There was a good turnout at the concert and they were happy with the amount of money raised. However, when she returned to the Abernathy's home, it had been bombed. The boycott finally ended on December 21, 1956, when federal injunctions were served, forcing Montgomery to comply with the court ruling.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nAlthough Jackson was internationally known and had moved up to the northern states, she still encountered racial prejudice. One account of this was when she tried to buy a house in Chicago. Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" />\n\nKing and Abernathy continued to protest segregation. In 1957, they founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The first major event sponsored by the SCLC was the [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]] in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1957, the third anniversary of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision.<ref name=\"MJ Gospel and Civil Rights\" /> From this point forward, Jackson appeared often with King, singing before his speeches and for SCLC fundraisers. In a 1962 SCLC press release, he wrote she had \"appeared on numerous programs that helped the struggle in the South, but now she has indicated that she wants to be involved on a regular basis\".<ref name=\"MJ MLK Stanford\" /> [[Jesse Jackson]] said when King called on her, she never refused, traveling with him to the deepest parts of the segregated South.<ref name=\"NPR MJ\">{{cite web|last=Glinton|first=Sonari|title=Mahalia Jackson: Voice Of The Civil Rights Movement|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123498527|work=[[50 great voices|50 Great Voices]]|publisher=NPR|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963, Jackson performed \"I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned\", before King  gave his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech.

Among her surviving relatives are her great-nephews, former NBA basketball player [[Danny Granger]] and soul artist [[Scotty Granger]].\n\nJackson's estate was reported at more than four million dollars. Some reporters estimated record royalties, television and movie residuals, and various investments made it worth more. The bulk of the estate was left to a number of relatives, many of whom cared for her during her early years. Among principal heirs were relatives including her half-brother, John Jackson, and aunt, Hannah Robinson. Neither of her ex-husbands, Isaac Hockenhull (1936\u20131941) nor Sigmund Galloway (1964\u20131967), was mentioned in her will.<ref>''Ebony'', April 1972.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\nJackson's music was played widely on gospel and [[Christian radio station]]s, such as [[Family Radio]].

A New History of Black Gospel Music'', New York: Continuum (2004), p. 220. {{ISBN|0-8264-1436-2}}.</ref> She was a close friend of [[Doris Akers]], one of the most prolific gospel composers of the 20th century. In 1958, they cowrote the hit \"Lord, Don't Move the Mountain\". Mahalia also sang many of Akers' own compositions such as \"God Is So Good to Me\", \"God Spoke to Me One Day\", \"Trouble\", \"Lead On, Lord Jesus\" and \"He's a Light Unto My Pathway\", helping Akers to secure her position as the leading female Gospel composer of that time. In addition to her singing career, she mentored the legendary soul singer [[Aretha Franklin]]. Jackson was also good friends with [[Dorothy Norwood]] and fellow Chicago-based gospel singer [[Albertina Walker]], and she discovered a young [[Della Reese]]. On the 20th anniversary of her death, [[Smithsonian Folkways]] Recording commemorated her with the album ''I Sing Because I'm Happy'', which includes interviews about her childhood conducted by [[Jules Scherwin]].\n\n''[[American Idol]]'' winner and [[Grammy Award]]-winning R&B singer [[Fantasia Barrino]] has been cast to play Jackson in a biographical film about her life.

The [[Stepped Stone Structure]] and [[Large Stone Structure]] in [[Jerusalem]] show that Jerusalem was at least somewhat populated in King David's time, and lends at least ''some'' credence to the biblical claim that Jerusalem was originally a Canaanite fortress, however, Jerusalem seems to have been barely developed until long after David's death, making it hard to believe it could have been the empiric capital described in the Bible.

Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the majority position, as described by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on \"certain historical kernels\", and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah.\n\n==Kings of Israel and Judah==\n{{Main|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n{{Kings of Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|500px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nAccording to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head. In David's case, this was done by the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].\n\nInitially, David was king over the [[Tribe of Judah]] only and ruled from [[Hebron]], but after seven and a half years, the other [[Israelite]] tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], chose him to be their king as well.<ref>Mandel, David. ''Who's Who in the Jewish Bible''. Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community. They were close to the government, and some served as advisers and tax collectors/finance ministers. \n\nThese families had special rights in Narbonne, Barcelona, the [[Knights Templar]] and Castile. They possessed real estate and received the title \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\" and\u00a0 ''de la Kblriih'' (''De la Cavalleria'').

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 \"And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile.

Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the majority position, as described by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on \"certain historical kernels\", and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah.\n\n==Kings of Israel and Judah==\n{{Main|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n{{Kings of Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|500px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nAccording to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head. In David's case, this was done by the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].\n\nInitially, David was king over the [[Tribe of Judah]] only and ruled from [[Hebron]], but after seven and a half years, the other [[Israelite]] tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], chose him to be their king as well.<ref>Mandel, David. ''Who's Who in the Jewish Bible''. Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community. They were close to the government, and some served as advisers and tax collectors/finance ministers. \n\nThese families had special rights in Narbonne, Barcelona, the [[Knights Templar]] and Castile. They possessed real estate and received the title \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\" and\u00a0 ''de la Kblriih'' (''De la Cavalleria'').

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 \"And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile.

After some years on the job, he started his studies of fine arts in 1984 at [[Berlin University of the Arts|UDK]] Berlin. In 1991, he graduated with his master in the class of [[Georg Baselitz]]. For many years he lived and worked in Berlin as an artist. \n\nHaving been attracted by [[Culture of Africa|African culture]] and art, he traveled to Ethiopia for the first time in 2007. Mertens stayed in Addis Ababa to work, and lives there to this day. He started teaching at the Addis Ababa University, Ale School of Fine Arts and Design (ASFAD), in 2010, where he founded a new class for [[lithography]]. \n\nIn 2013, he established a partnership between the Ale School of fine Arts and Design and the Hochschule f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste in [[Dresden]], Germany. He now coordinates the exchange program between both academies.\n\nIn his early career, Klaus Mertens attributed to figurative art by a series of large woodcuts he called \u201cWoodcut Tattoos\u201d. This work celebrated the human body; appearing as grand, austere images, playing with patterns, and giving the surface an occult and strong expression. \n\nHis handy \u201cSocial Prints\u201d are graphics showing poetic, sensitive images like landscapes and portraits combining elements of pop art and traditional woodcarving. When he moved to Ethiopia, Mertens artwork expanded to sculpturing, photography and design. There, he transferred his kind of work with ornaments and patterns \u2013 known for his woodcut prints \u2013 into the third dimension. Using materials of a lower aesthetic value like plastic bags, branches, bones or animal skulls, he created emblematic pieces of art like the ''Fashion Racks'' (2008), ''Jungle Fighter'' (2009), ''Knitted Egg'' (2014), ''True to Nature'' (2015), ''Global Suit'' (2015), ''Hypoxylon Addis'' (2015). \n\nIt was for this reason that one of his exhibitions in Addis Ababa, at the Asni Gallery in 2012, was called: ''Big Pretenders, Trophies and a Drunken Donkey''. Mertens\u2018 work reflects the human behavior of wasting nature or hunting for trophies practiced all over the African Continent. That this kind of power counts more than knowledge, spirit and science provokes Mertens\u2018 reflections in his art. Deconstructing perceptions, materials and meanings are part of his work. \n\nSince 2010, Klaus Mertens has created sculptures that can be used as furniture as well. Working with this kind of design, Mertens can be seen in the tradition of artists like [[Richard Artschwager]] or Ron Aaron. His stool design received a prize in [[Vienna]] in 2010 by Habari and branded ato klaus. The stool is now distributed worldwide. Other \"furniture objects\u201c are the ''ato goethe'' collection constructed from recycled floor wood of the German institution in Addis. Also, he has created what are called ''ato goma'', objects shaped from woven rubber stripes of car tires.\n\n==Selected exhibitions==\nSolo shows:\n* 2016 Lela Gallery, Addis Ababa\n* 2015 Alliance Ethio Francaise, Addis Ababa\n* 2012 Asni Gallery,  Addis Ababa\n* 2011 Alliance Ethio Francaise, Addis Ababa\n* 2010 German House, Addis Abeba\n* 2009 Commerzbank Representative Office, Addis Abeba\n* 2008 Showroom, Addis Ababa.

This allowed residents to commute to work in Baltimore. Commuter traffic exploded in the 1890s with the construction of [[electric trolley|electric streetcar]] lines and fancy housing developments. Catonsville had become one of the first commuter suburbs in the United States. Baltimore had tried to annex Catonsville, although their attempts have all been failures.<ref name=digital/><ref name=ushistory/> Their last attempt was in 1918.\n\nHomes of all sizes were constructed rapidly until the 1950s, when much of land around the Frederick Turnpike had been converted into housing. A new and modern business district opened along the newly built Baltimore National Pike, north from the Frederick Turnpike.\n\nCatonsville was briefly made famous during the 1968 protest by the \"[[Catonsville Nine]]\", during which draft records were burned by Catholic anti-war activists.\n\nIn 2002, the Maryland legislature issued a proclamation declaring Catonsville to be \"Music City, Maryland\", because of the concentration of musical retail stores, venues and educational facilities in the area.
