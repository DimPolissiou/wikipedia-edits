This collaboration led to the founding of the remix team Audio Assembly (with Billy Waters and John Michael DiSpirito) who have produced for artists such as [[Taylor Dayne]] and Eddie X ft. Niki Harris. Joel also worked with John Michael DiSpirito under the name Hell & Keller, who have produced widely circulated bootlegs of songs by [[The Human League]], [[Willow Smith]], and others.<ref name=\"djbuddybeaverhausen.blogspot.com\"/> Beginning in 2012, Joel joined forces with international DJ/producer/record executive Jerome Farley.

His officially released remix work includes many songs that have achieved [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Billboard Club]] charting status, including [[Barbra Streisand]] - Don't Lie To Me (from [[Walls (Barbra Streisand album)|Walls]]) (#8)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/dance-club-play-songs|title=Dance Songs: Top Dance Music Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>,  [[Whitney Houston]] - \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\" (#1), [[Tony Moran]] ft.

[[Scarlett Santana]] - \"Rain\" (#8).\n\nJoel has worked with [[Junior Vasquez]] on a number of projects, including Junior's remix of the lead single from [[Whitney Houston]]'s final album, \"[[I Didn't Know My Own Strength (Whitney Houston song)]],\" Whitney's \"[[Million Dollar Bill]],\" \"X (Factory Reset Mix),\" the 2018 revival of \"[[If Madonna Calls]] (Brutally Proud Mix),\" and many others.\n\nJoel began creating \"bedroom bootleg\" mixes in 1997 after discovering an interest in DJ'ing.<ref name=\"djbuddybeaverhausen.blogspot.com\">Dj Buddy Beaverhausen's Q&A with Producer Joel Dickinson [http://djbuddybeaverhausen.blogspot.com/2012/02/dj-buddy-beaverhausens-q-with-dj-joel.html \"Dj Buddy Beaverhausen's Q&A with Producer Joel Dickinson\"], ''Dj Buddy Beaverhausen's Q&A with Producer Joel Dickinson'', accessed February 23, 2012.</ref> In 1998, he began his first DJ residency at Trikkx in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], where he played many of his earliest remixes and edits. He followed this residency with stints at The Saloon in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] in 2002 and various other clubs and special events in the Twin Cities metro area, throughout the Midwest, and beyond.\n\nIn 2001, he began producing under the alias, ''Thee Werq'n B!tches''. Under this name, Joel perhaps became best known for his remixes of gay camp classics. Some of these included: [[Liza Minnelli]] - \"[[Cabaret (Cabaret song)|Cabaret (song)]]\",<ref name=\"Liza Minnelli - Cabaret (Thee Werq'n B!tches Mix)\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1csOE2WvBc |title=Liza Minnelli - Cabaret (Thee Werq'n B!tches Mix) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> [[Dolly Parton]] - \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)]]\",<ref name=\"Dolly Parton - 9 To 5 (Thee Werq'n B!tches Mix)\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov09j8509wI |title=Thee Werq'n B!tches Feat Dolly Parton 9 to 5 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> [[Bette Davis]] - \"I've Written A Letter To Daddy\" (from [[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

Many of these have become sensations in their own right. This was never more evident than when Joel received the highly coveted award of \"Gayest Thing on the Internet\" for his remix and subsequent video for Thee Werq'n B!tches ft. [[Faye Dunaway]] - \"No Wire Hangers!\" by [[VH1]]'s Best Week Ever in 2008.<ref>VH1 [http://www.bestweekever.tv/2008-02-26/gayest-thing-on-the-internet-mommie-dearest-remixes/ \"Gayest Thing on the Internet\"], ''VH1 Best Week Ever'', February 26, 2008, accessed July 1, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, he began a very fruitful collaboration with John Michael DiSpirito and Billy Waters, two DJs and producers from NYC. This collaboration led to the founding of the remix team Audio Assembly (with Billy Waters and John Michael DiSpirito) who have produced for artists such as [[Taylor Dayne]] and Eddie X ft. Niki Harris. Joel also worked with John Michael DiSpirito under the name Hell & Keller, who have produced widely circulated bootlegs of songs by [[The Human League]], [[Willow Smith]], and others.<ref name=\"djbuddybeaverhausen.blogspot.com\"/> Beginning in 2012, Joel joined forces with international DJ/producer/record executive Jerome Farley. This partnership has produced productions for [[Tony Moran]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[Jessica Sutta]], and many others.\n\nJoel is an alumnus of [[Dowling Catholic High School]] and the [[University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Remixes===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

At the time, the label went through several CEO's and eventually shut down their urban music division from 1996-1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Chuck|title=Hip hop has really got the house jumpin'|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-hiphopphilips24june2497,0,5819169.story?page=1|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 24, 1997}}</ref>  When the record label got a new president in former [[Arista Records]] executive Roy Lott, he revived Capitol's long-struggling urban music division. Spencer acknowledged the changes within Capitol in the liner notes of ''Tracie''. She stated: ''\"I have seen a lot of changes occur at the tower, but that's just the way life goes. I have nothing but love and respect for my record company. Change is good\"''.<ref>Tracie Spencer - Tracie.

It was her first album in nine years on Capitol Records. The primary reason for the length of time between her studio albums was due to Capitol's constant changes. At the time, the label went through several CEO's and eventually shut down their urban music division from 1996-1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Chuck|title=Hip hop has really got the house jumpin'|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-hiphopphilips24june2497,0,5819169.story?page=1|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 24, 1997}}</ref>  When the record label got a new president in former [[Arista Records]] executive Roy Lott, he revived Capitol's long-struggling urban music division. Spencer acknowledged the changes within Capitol in the liner notes of ''Tracie''. She stated: ''\"I have seen a lot of changes occur at the tower, but that's just the way life goes. I have nothing but love and respect for my record company. Change is good\"''.<ref>Tracie Spencer - Tracie. (CD liner notes) Capitol Records 7243 8 34287 2 8</ref>\n\nAlthough this is Spencer's first album in over a decade, this was not her first recording of new material. She recorded a couple of songs for the soundtracks of two films from the late 90's. She sang \"I'll Be There For You\" for the 1997 [[Nickelodeon]] film ''[[Good Burger]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Burger (1997) - Soundtracks - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119215/soundtrack|work=tracklisting|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref> as well as the [[DJ Quik]] produced \"The Rain\" for the 1998 [[Maya Angelou]] directed film ''[[Down in the Delta]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunao Ikeda|first=Jaime|title=Down In The Delta - Original Soundtrack|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/down-in-the-delta-mw0000045731|work=soundtrack album|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref> She worked with the Danish R&B production team Soulshock & Karlin for all but one song on ''Tracie'', with [[Dallas Austin]] protege Arnold Hennings providing his lone contribution \"Love To You\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Tracie|title=Tracie|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tracie-Spencer-Tracie/release/3377021|work=studio album|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref> Two singles were released from the album in 1999 with \"[[It's All About You (Not About Me)]]\" and \"[[Still in My Heart]]\", aided by music videos directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and [[Kevin Bray (director)|Kevin Bray]], respectively.
