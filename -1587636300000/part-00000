Throughout history, examples of authoritarian capitalism include [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]'s and [[Jorge Ubico]]'s respective reigns in [[Guatemala]], [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u20131990)|reign in Chile]], [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] in [[Indonesia]] and the [[People's Action Party]]'s early administration in [[Singapore]].<ref name=\":1\"/> During [[World War I]], the ideological divide between authoritarian and liberal regimes was significantly less pronounced as both were aligned to [[Capitalism|capitalist economic models]]. Moreover, the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] have been described as possessing [[Inverted totalitarianism|totalitarian capitalist]] economic systems, acting as examples of the early developments of authoritarian capitalism.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2007-07-01/return-authoritarian-great-powers|title=The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers|last=Gat|first=Azar|date=1 July 2007|work=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the end of World War II, various authoritarian capitalism regimes emerged, developed and transitioned into a liberal capitalist model through East Asia, Southern Europe and Latin America. It has been argued that the change of these early regimes was predominately due to the dominance of liberal capitalist countries such as the [[United States]] as opposed to a natural transition, suggesting that modern authoritarian capitalist regimes may further develop the system.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\n=== Recent prominence ===\n[[File:Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant ground-breaking ceremony 07.jpg|left|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], both prominent recent figures for authoritarian capitalism]]\nWhile having been a relatively unknown system due to the failure of authoritarianism within the [[First World]] during the [[Cold War]], with the transition of authoritarian countries such as [[China]] and [[Russia]] to capitalist economic models, authoritarian capitalism has recently rose into prominence.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/opinion/14iht-edgat.1.6137311.html|title=The return of Authoritarian Capitalists|last=Gat|first=Azar|date=14 June 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref> While it was initially thought that changing to a capitalist model would lead to the formation of a [[liberal democracy]] within authoritarian countries, the continued persistence of an authoritarian capitalist models has led to this view decreasing in popularity.<ref name=\":3\"/> Furthermore, some have argued that by utilising capitalist economic models authoritarian governments have improved the stability of their regimes through improving the quality of life of their citizenship.<ref name=\":1\"/> Highlighting this appeal, [[Robert Kagan]] stated: \"There's no question that China is an attractive model for autocrats who would like to be able to pursue economic growth without losing control of the levers of power\".<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\nMoreover, authoritarian capitalist regimes have experienced notable growth in their economic production, with the [[International Monetary Fund]] stating that authoritarian capitalist countries experienced an average 6.28% [[Economic growth|GDP growth rate]] compared to the 2.62% of liberal capitalist countries. In addition, many have argued the inability of liberal capitalism, with the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] and the slow response of the United States government, to quickly respond to crisis compared to more authoritarian systems has been bought into prominence. In fact, many argue that authoritarian capitalism and liberal capitalism have or will compete on the global stage.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":11\">{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-west-is-blind-to-the-appeal-of-chinas-model-of-authoritarian-capitalism-2015-7?IR=T|title=The West is blind to the appeal of China's model of authoritarian capitalism|date=19 July 2015|work=Business Insider|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2009/06/western-vs-authoritarian-capitalism/|title=Western Vs.

The prominent utilization of [[State-owned enterprise|state owned corporations]] and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s within authoritarian capitalist regimes demonstrates such a tendency, with Russia decreasing its private ownership of oil from 90% to 50% while transitioning to a more authoritarian model under the leadership of [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nIt has also been noted by individuals such as Richard W. Carney that authoritarian regimes have a strong tendency to utilise their economies as a method to increase their influence heavily investing in their economies through state owned enterprises. Carney describes the intervention of authoritarian states occurring through means he describes as extra-shareholder tactics, including regulations, government contracts and protectionist policies alongside the state engaging in [[shareholder activism]]. Moreover, he focuses on the use of state owned funds to engage in take-overs of key assets in other countries such as [[Khazanah Nasional]]'s takeover of [[Parkway Pantai]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite book|title=Authoritarian Capitalism|last=Carney|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=9781108186797}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences ===\nWithin countries that practice authoritarian capitalism, state capitalism is generally also present to some extent and vice versa. As such, there is a widespread confusion between the terms with them at times being treated as [[synonym]]ous by individuals such as former Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]].<ref name=\":12\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/politics/kevin-rudd-authoritarian-capitalism.html|title=The Rise of Authoritarian Capitalism|last=Rudd|first=Kevin|date=16 September 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref> However, there remains a fundamental difference with state capitalism being a system in which government owned entities engage in for-profit activities while authoritarian capitalism is a system where an authoritarian regime co-exists with, or at least attempts to adopt aspects of, a [[market economy]], highlighted in countries such as Hungary by the [[Transnational Institute]].<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/en/article/hungarys-regime-is-proof-that-capitalism-can-be-deeply-authoritarian|title=Hungary's regime is proof that capitalism can be deeply authoritarian|last=Scheiring|first=G\u00e1bor|date=23 April 2018|publisher=Transnational Institute|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n=== China ===\n{{further|Economy of China}}\nIt is generally agreed that [[China]] is an authoritarian regime, with the [[Fraser Institute]] ranking them 136th for personal freedom<ref name=\":4\"/> and the [[Human Rights Watch|Human Right Watch]]'s 2018 report describing a \"broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" within China due to the treatment of [[List of Chinese dissidents|activists]], restrictions to [[freedom of information]], [[Political freedom|political expression]], [[religious freedom]] and [[minority rights]] as their core reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018|title=World Report 2018 - Status of Human Rights Around the World|date=13 December 2017|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref> Moreover, while recognising the limited scope and reducing pace of capitalism within China, with [[The Heritage Foundation]] ranking them 110th for economic freedom in 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/international-economies/commentary/2018-index-economic-freedom|title=2018 |work=[[Index of Economic Freedom]]|date=2 February 2018|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref> Michael Witt argues that China broadly displays capitalist traits with a significant number of companies either being private or shared between private and public owners alongside a strong [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial presence]] despite a continued predominance of indirect state control.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|date=December 2013|title=China: Authoritarian Capitalism|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Asian Business Systems|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199654925.001.0001|isbn=9780199654925|last1=Witt|first1=Michael A.|last2=Redding|first2=Gordon}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=What kind of indirect state control?|date=December 2018}}\n\nAs with most authoritarian capitalist regimes, there is a contention on viability of the continued viability of the model within China, with some reporters including Joseph Kurlantzick and Yuen Yuen Ang stating that China is unable to fully utilise the entrepreneurial elements needed to drive future growth due to its authoritarian practices, continued attempts to maintain authority will harm innovation.

These reforms have been described as involving both obtaining the support of businesses through low corporate tax rates alongside preventing opposition from entities such as trade unions or low income workers through the use of authoritarian measures.<ref name=\":10\"/>\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{further|Economy of Russia}}\n[[File:Putin and Yeltsin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Putin and [[Boris Yeltsin]], both prominent figures of the development of authoritarian capitalism in [[Russia]]]]\nGat Azar describes [[Russia]] along with China as a prominent example of a modern authoritarian capitalist nation, describing the nation as becoming increasingly authoritarian while maintaining a predominately capitalist economic model.<ref name=\":1\"/> [[Aaron Friedberg|Aaron L. Friedberg]] simplifies the evolution of the Russian model in the following statement: \"The Russian system has also evolved from communist totalitarianism to a form of nationalist authoritarian capitalism that appears for the moment at least to be relatively stable\". Friedberg also describes the [[1996 Russian presidential election|1996 presidential election]] as the point where authoritarian capitalism began forming within Russia, depicting an increasingly powerful majority party backed by media controlled by [[Russian oligarch|oligarchies]] and lead by [[Boris Yeltsin]] and later [[Vladimir Putin]]. From 1999 under Putin, Friedberg describes the Russian regime as solidifying its power through a re-obtaining state control of natural resources, obtaining control of media and limiting dissidence through measures such as restricting [[non-governmental organization]] operations.<ref name=\":14\"/>\n\n=== Singapore ===\n{{further|Economy of Singapore}}\n[[File:Lee Kuan Yew.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], a major figure in the development of [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economic model]]]]\n[[Singapore]] is considered by agencies such as the [[Human Rights Watch]] as a highly repressive regime.

As such, most experts seem to have agreed that the authoritarian capitalist model is unstable and will eventually transition into that of [[liberal capitalism]], with Daniel W. Drezner stating: \"The conventional wisdom in comparative politics is that as societies get richer [...] they also start demanding more [[political accountability]]\".<ref name=\":0\"/> In opposition, some argue that the increased wealth of capitalist regimes allows authoritarian regimes to more adequately utilise [[technology]] to assist in maintaining their regimes.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite news|url=https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/the-challenge-from-authoritarian-capitalism-to-liberal-democracy|title=The Challenge from Authoritarian Capitalism to Liberal Democracy|work=China-US Focus|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism ===\nIt is widely believed that through pursuing capitalist economic models a country is able to increase the [[quality of life]] of its citizens through higher levels of [[economic growth]]. This increase in quality of life is viewed as inherently detrimental to the continuation of an authoritarian regime. It is widely believed that individuals will increasingly seek to reduce restrictions upon their [[human rights]] as their quality of life and access to communication resources increase.<ref name=\":0\"/> As such, it is commonly thought by experts that the increasing implementation of capitalism will inevitably lead to citizens revolting against authoritarian governments.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn addition, it is also widely thought that the restrictions to freedom of expression found in authoritarian regimes is harmful to the ability of citizens to [[Innovation|innovate]] and engage in [[entrepreneurship]],<ref name=\":7\"/> leading to a reduction in the economic growth of the country. As some experts have claimed that authoritarian capitalist regimes primarily obtain their [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] through their ability to deliver economic growth,<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> this inherent restriction upon it would eventually lead to the collapse of the regime.\n\nMoreover, authoritarian capitalist regimes are viewed as having to face civil disobedience towards their authoritarian characteristics, exhibited by countries such as China experiencing 87,000 instances of [[Protest|mass unrest]] in 2005.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Defense ===\nIt has been argued that authoritarian capitalism is a potential competitor with liberal capitalism, with the recent success of authoritarian capitalist regimes such as China being used as the core of their argument.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":8\"/> It has been further stated that through utilizing elements of capitalism, regimes may more effectively employ modern technologies to suppress [[Dissident|dissidence]] towards government such as the [[Great Firewall]] utilized within China.<ref name=\":8\"/> In addition, individuals such as [[Niv Horesh]] argue that authoritarian capitalist model offered by China is a viable alternative to liberal capitalism, with more effective decision making processes.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":13\">{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anderscorr/2016/03/16/the-tipping-point-of-chinas-authoritarian-capitalism/#9e7fd3c3fca8|title=The Tipping Point Of China's Authoritarian Capitalism|last=Corr|first=Anders|date=16 March 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, it is argued by others that capitalist [[free-market]] policies lead to an increase in authoritarian policies such as those pursued by [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name=\":11\"/> The core of this argument lies in the view that citizens will support whichever regime provides material comforts which increasing [[economic inequality]] and [[automation]] in liberal capitalist nations undermine. Moreover, challenges to liberal capitalism from an inability to adequately cope with advances of technology have also been raised, summarised in the statement by former Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]: \"Democracies, like corporations, can now be hacked\".<ref name=\":12\"/> Alongside technological challenges, a seeming failure to address structural issues such as [[gerrymandering]] have also been raised.<ref name=\":12\"/> In addition, the expansion of China has been described as a compelling argument for the success of its authoritarian capitalist regime.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n[[Aaron Friedberg]] of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation has also noted that authoritarian capitalist nations have utilised an exploitation of the [[Western world]], the reshaping of the international order and exclusion of international actors in an attempt to establish their systems of governance.

In addition, many have argued the inability of liberal capitalism, with the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] and the slow response of the United States government, to quickly respond to crisis compared to more authoritarian systems has been bought into prominence.

The prominent utilization of [[State-owned enterprise|state owned corporations]] and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s within authoritarian capitalist regimes demonstrates such a tendency, with Russia decreasing its private ownership of oil from 90% to 50% while transitioning to a more authoritarian model under the leadership of [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nIt has also been noted by individuals such as Richard W. Carney that authoritarian regimes have a strong tendency to utilise their economies as a method to increase their influence heavily investing in their economies through state owned enterprises. Carney describes the intervention of authoritarian states occurring through means he describes as extra-shareholder tactics, including regulations, government contracts and protectionist policies alongside the state engaging in [[shareholder activism]].

His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This \"[[return to order]]\" is characteristic of much post-[[World War I]] art, and can be compared with the [[neoclassicism]] of Picasso and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] as well as the return to traditionalism of [[Andr\u00e9 Derain|Derain]].\nMatisse's [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[odalisque]] paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.<ref>Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981). ''Paris in the Third Reich: A History of the German Occupation, 1940\u20131944''. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref> He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary. Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/> Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity\u2014an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.<ref>{{Citation | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Cut-outs\">{{Citation| last =MoMA | title =Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs| pages =| year = 2014| url =http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1469| accessdate =19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the paper cut-out was Matisse's major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the ''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', an opera composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"The Cut-outs\" /> [[Albert C. Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chapel and museum===\n\nIn 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]], which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, [[chasubles]], and tabernacle door\u2014all planned using the cut-out method\u2014had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.<ref>{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 9] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 }}</ref><br />\n\nThis project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite him being an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henri Matisse: Modernist Against the Grain|year=2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035123|author=Catherine Bock-Weiss|page=147|quote=Natural enough, since he was surrounded by priests and nuns during his later illnesses and while working on the Venice Chapel, even though he remained a convinced atheist.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/arts/design/29jacques.html ''Sister Jacques-Marie Influence for Matisse's Rosary Chapel, Dies'', NY Times, 29 September 2005] Retrieved 27 July 2010</ref> They had met again in [[Vence]] and started the collaboration, a story related in her 1992 book ''Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence'' and in the 2003 documentary \"A Model for Matisse\".<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/030630_matisse.html French Professor Directs \"Model for Matisse\"], Carnegie Mellon Today, 30 June 2003.

In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al.

Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\n\nIn 1907, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=Britannica>{{Britannica|369401}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangier]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name=\"The Moroccans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588|title=Henri Matisse.

One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]]s, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] with her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein, and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings.

His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This \"[[return to order]]\" is characteristic of much post-[[World War I]] art, and can be compared with the [[neoclassicism]] of Picasso and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] as well as the return to traditionalism of [[Andr\u00e9 Derain|Derain]].\nMatisse's [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[odalisque]] paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.<ref>Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981). ''Paris in the Third Reich: A History of the German Occupation, 1940\u20131944''. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref> He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary. Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/> Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity\u2014an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.<ref>{{Citation | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Cut-outs\">{{Citation| last =MoMA | title =Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs| pages =| year = 2014| url =http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1469| accessdate =19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the paper cut-out was Matisse's major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the ''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', an opera composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"The Cut-outs\" /> [[Albert C. Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><br />\n\n===Chapel and museum===\n\nIn 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]], which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, [[chasubles]], and tabernacle door\u2014all planned using the cut-out method\u2014had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.<ref>{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 9] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/9 }}</ref><br />\n\nThis project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite him being an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henri Matisse: Modernist Against the Grain|year=2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035123|author=Catherine Bock-Weiss|page=147|quote=Natural enough, since he was surrounded by priests and nuns during his later illnesses and while working on the Venice Chapel, even though he remained a convinced atheist.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/arts/design/29jacques.html ''Sister Jacques-Marie Influence for Matisse's Rosary Chapel, Dies'', NY Times, 29 September 2005] Retrieved 27 July 2010</ref> They had met again in [[Vence]] and started the collaboration, a story related in her 1992 book ''Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence'' and in the 2003 documentary \"A Model for Matisse\".<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/030630_matisse.html French Professor Directs \"Model for Matisse\"], Carnegie Mellon Today, 30 June 2003.

In their excitement, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her cryokinetic magic. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, call for the aid of the colony of hidden folk, led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. Elsa asks for Grand Pabbie to remove her magic, but Grand Pabbie says that it is a part of her, and he gives her a vision of her future, frightening Elsa, who believes that her magic will cause death. The King isolates the sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna when Anna seeks her out (\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"). Elsa's fear of her powers grow, and the King and Queen are powerless to help. The parents die at sea during a storm while both princesses are still young.\n\nTen years later, as Elsa turns twenty-one, she is being crowned queen of Arendelle. Anna is excited for the castle's gates to open (\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\") and meets the handsome Prince Hans (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\"). Elsa is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her, while wishing to be able to reconnect with Anna (\"Dangerous to Dream\"). Elsa's coronation goes smoothly, and she initiates her first contact with Anna in years. They enjoy the coronation together, with Anna talking the Duke of Weselton out of dancing with the newly crowned Queen. However, Elsa leaves Anna after her younger sister asks about keeping the gates open. Anna falls in love with Hans (\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"), who quickly proposes marriage to her, and the two share a kiss. The couple asks for Elsa's blessing, who objects because the two have only known each other for a day.  After intense questioning from Anna about shutting her out from her life, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the castle to the North Mountain without realizing that her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna goes in search of Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom during her absence. Up in the mountain, ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven (\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\") find the ill-equipped Anna, still in her coronation dress. Kristoff gives her a set of winter clothes, and she leaves her dress behind. Kristoff and Anna disagree about love while crossing a bridge (\"What Do You Know About Love\"), with Anna saving Kristoff from falling off the bridge. Anna and Kristoff then encounter a newly created Olaf, who offers to guide them to Elsa, and sings about his love for summer (\"[[In Summer]]\"). A soldier arrives in Arendelle with Anna's dress from the mountain, and Hans fears for Anna's safety. He assembles a search party (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise)), with the Duke sending two of his men with secret orders to kill Elsa. Meanwhile, on the North Mountain, Elsa throws off her cloak, builds an ice castle with her powers, and transforms her coronation dress into a sparkly ice gown (\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna to meet the owner, Oaken (\"Hygge\"). Anna enjoys the sauna together with its many other patrons. Kristoff convinces Oaken and his patrons to aid their journey, which enables them to get provisions, and Anna gets a winter dress.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes angry and frustrated, saying that she cannot fix it, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart (\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)). Elsa then kicks Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf out while wondering what to do (\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise)). Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the hidden folk, his adoptive family, who recognize Anna as the princess and think she's Kristoff's fianc\u00e9e (\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"). Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss, at the sacrifice of his own hidden love for her (\"Kristoff Lullaby\").\n\nBack in the ice castle, Elsa considers whether she is a monster and wonders how can she end the storm, not sure whether the storm would end or grow worse if she were to die (\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\"). She resolves to stay alive to end the storm, but Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, capturing Elsa. Back at the castle, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2)). Hans locks Anna in a room to die, as Anna reflects on her mistakes while still holding on to the idea of love (\"True Love\"). Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.\n\nOutside the castle, Hans publicly charges Elsa with treason and sentences her to death. Elsa escapes her chains and flees outside as a blizzard grows (\"Colder by the Minute\"). Kristoff and Anna struggle to find each other. Hans confronts Elsa, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna finally finds Kristoff but spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans.

In their excitement, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her cryokinetic magic. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, call for the aid of the colony of hidden folk, led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. Elsa asks for Grand Pabbie to remove her magic, but Grand Pabbie says that it is a part of her, and he gives her a vision of her future, frightening Elsa, who believes that her magic will cause death. The King isolates the sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna when Anna seeks her out (\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"). Elsa's fear of her powers grow, and the King and Queen are powerless to help. The parents die at sea during a storm while both princesses are still young.\n\nTen years later, as Elsa turns twenty-one, she is being crowned queen of Arendelle. Anna is excited for the castle's gates to open (\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\") and meets the handsome Prince Hans (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\"). Elsa is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her, while wishing to be able to reconnect with Anna (\"Dangerous to Dream\"). Elsa's coronation goes smoothly, and she initiates her first contact with Anna in years. They enjoy the coronation together, with Anna talking the Duke of Weselton out of dancing with the newly crowned Queen. However, Elsa leaves Anna after her younger sister asks about keeping the gates open. Anna falls in love with Hans (\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"), who quickly proposes marriage to her, and the two share a kiss. The couple asks for Elsa's blessing, who objects because the two have only known each other for a day.  After intense questioning from Anna about shutting her out from her life, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the castle to the North Mountain without realizing that her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna goes in search of Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom during her absence. Up in the mountain, ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven (\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\") find the ill-equipped Anna, still in her coronation dress. Kristoff gives her a set of winter clothes, and she leaves her dress behind. Kristoff and Anna disagree about love while crossing a bridge (\"What Do You Know About Love\"), with Anna saving Kristoff from falling off the bridge. Anna and Kristoff then encounter a newly created Olaf, who offers to guide them to Elsa, and sings about his love for summer (\"[[In Summer]]\"). A soldier arrives in Arendelle with Anna's dress from the mountain, and Hans fears for Anna's safety. He assembles a search party (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise)), with the Duke sending two of his men with secret orders to kill Elsa. Meanwhile, on the North Mountain, Elsa throws off her cloak, builds an ice castle with her powers, and transforms her coronation dress into a sparkly ice gown (\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna to meet the owner, Oaken (\"Hygge\"). Anna enjoys the sauna together with its many other patrons. Kristoff convinces Oaken and his patrons to aid their journey, which enables them to get provisions, and Anna gets a winter dress.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes angry and frustrated, saying that she cannot fix it, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart (\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)). Elsa then kicks Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf out while wondering what to do (\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise)). Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the hidden folk, his adoptive family, who recognize Anna as the princess and think she's Kristoff's fianc\u00e9e (\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"). Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss, at the sacrifice of his own hidden love for her (\"Kristoff Lullaby\").\n\nBack in the ice castle, Elsa considers whether she is a monster and wonders how can she end the storm, not sure whether the storm would end or grow worse if she were to die (\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\"). She resolves to stay alive to end the storm, but Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, capturing Elsa. Back at the castle, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2)). Hans locks Anna in a room to die, as Anna reflects on her mistakes while still holding on to the idea of love (\"True Love\"). Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.\n\nOutside the castle, Hans publicly charges Elsa with treason and sentences her to death. Elsa escapes her chains and flees outside as a blizzard grows (\"Colder by the Minute\"). Kristoff and Anna struggle to find each other. Hans confronts Elsa, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna finally finds Kristoff but spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa mourns her sister, who thaws out, her sacrifice constituting \"an act of true love\". Realizing that her magic is controlled by love, Elsa ends the winter (\"Vuelie (Love Thaws)\"). Anna punches Hans, and she and Kristoff become a couple. Elsa and Anna reunite without fear for the first time, as the departed King and Queen, young Elsa and young Anna appear in the background, signaling the healing of the sisters' painful past (Finale).\n\n==Musical numbers==\nAll songs by [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]] unless otherwise noted.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*\"Vuelie\"\u2020\u2021 \u2013 Company (music and lyrics by [[Christophe Beck]] and [[Frode Fjellheim]]) \n*\"Let the Sun Shine On\" \u2013 Young Anna, Young Elsa, King, Queen and Townspeople\n*\"A Little Bit of You\" \u2013 Young Elsa and Young Anna\n*\"Hidden Folk\" \u2013 Queen, Pabbie, Young Elsa, King and Company\n*\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Young Anna, Anna and Elsa\n*\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna, Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" \u2013 Hans\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" \u2013 Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Hans\n*\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"What Do You Know About Love?\" \u2013 Anna and Kristoff\n*\"[[In Summer]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Olaf\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise) \u2013 Hans, Weselton and Townspeople\n*\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Elsa\n{{col-2}}\n;Act II\n*\"Hygge\" \u2013 Oaken, Kristoff, Anna, Olaf, Family and Friends\n*\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Elsa\n*\"I Can't Lose You \u2013 Anna and Elsa (song added February 2020)\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise) \u2013 Elsa\n*\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Bulda, Pabbie, Olaf and Hidden Folk\n*\"Kristoff Lullaby\" \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\" \u2013 Elsa, Hans and Men\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2) \u2013 Hans and Anna\n*\"True Love\" \u2013 Anna\n*\"Colder by the Minute\" \u2013 Anna, Kristoff, Elsa, Hans and Townspeople\n*\"Finale\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n\u2020 Featured in the [[Frozen (2013 film)|2013 film]].\n\u2021 \"Vuelie\" written by [[Frode Fjellheim]] and [[Christophe Beck]]\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! \"width=15%;\" | Character\n! \"width:30%;\" | Original Broadway cast<br/><small>(2018)</small>\n! \"width:30%;\" | US tour cast<br/><small>(2019)</small><ref>[https://tourstoyou.org/2019/09/23/casting-news-frozen-announces-full-touring-cast \"Casting News: ''Frozen'' Announces Full Touring Cast\"], ToursToYou.org, September 23, 2019</ref>\n|-\n!

However, the specific title \"Pharaoh\" was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the rule of [[Merneptah]] in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]], c. 1200 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers, there was an [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary]] used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a [[Horus name]], a [[Prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|Sedge and Bee]] (''nswt-bjtj'') name and a Two Ladies (''nbtj'') name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.\n\nEgypt was continually governed, at least in part, by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years, until it was conquered by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in the late 8th century BC, whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest, Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]], whose rulers also adopted the title of \"Pharaoh\". The last native pharaoh of Egypt was [[Nectanebo II]], who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time.\n\nAchaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, after which it was ruled by the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] Pharaohs of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Dynasty]]. Their rule, and the independence of Egypt, came to an end when Egypt became a province of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in 30 BC. [[Augustus]] and subsequent [[Roman emperor]]s were [[Roman pharaoh|styled as Pharaoh]] when in Egypt until the reign of [[Maximinus Daia]] in 314 AD.\n\nThe dates given in this '''list of pharaohs''' are approximate. They are based primarily on the [[conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt]], mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt//|title=Digital Egypt for Universities|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> database developed by the [[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]], but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately.{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Ancient Egyptian king lists ==\nModern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records, including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories, such as [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptiaca'', as well as archaeological evidence.

He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years, longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting [[famine]].\n\nThe kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties, who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty, tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years, they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. Some time after these events, a rival line based at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united [[Upper Egypt]]. Around 2055 BC, [[Mentuhotep II]], the son and successor of pharaoh [[Intef III]] defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands, thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.\n\n===Seventh and Eighth Dynasties (combined)===\n{{Main|Seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Seventh and Eighth Dynasties]] ruled for approximately 20\u201345 years (possibly 2181 to 2160 BC). They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] over a possibly divided Egypt and, in any case, holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved.\nThe list below is based on the [[Abydos King List]] dating to the reign of [[Seti I]] and taken from [[J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath]]'s ''Handbuch der \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigsnamen''<ref name=\"beck\">[[J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath]]: ''Handbuch der \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigsnamen'', M\u00fcnchner \u00e4gyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : P. von Zabern, 1999, {{ISBN|3-8053-2591-6}}, [http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4xjd6j4qed3c9vl available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222200801/http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4xjd6j4qed3c9vl |date=2015-12-22 }}</ref> as well as from [[Kim Ryholt]]'s latest reconstruction of the [[Turin King List|Turin canon]], another king list dating to the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Ramesside Era]].<ref name=\"ryholt2000\">[[Kim Ryholt]]: \"The Late Old Kingdom in the Turin King-list and the Identity of Nitocris\", Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00e4gyptische, 127, 2000, p. 99</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

He may be an ephemeral king, or a name variant of a king of the 12th or 13th Dynasty.\n\n==Second Intermediate Period==\n{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\nThe [[Second Intermediate Period]] (1802\u20131550 BC) is a period of disarray between the end of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], and the start of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. It is best known as when the [[Hyksos]], whose reign comprised the [[Fifteenth dynasty of Egypt|Fifteenth Dynasty]], made their appearance in Egypt.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] was much weaker than the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the provincial ruling family in [[Xois]], located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite [[Fourteenth dynasty of Egypt|Fourteenth Dynasty]].\n\nThe Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of [[Sobekhotep IV]], and around 1720 BC took control of the town of [[Avaris]] (the modern [[Tell el-Dab'a]]/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by [[Salitis]] the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], thereby terminating the 13th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter.\n\nSubsequently, as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]]. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and finally Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.\n\n===Thirteenth Dynasty===\n{{Main|Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] (following the [[Turin King List]]) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho. This table should be contrasted with [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt#Known|Known kings of the 13th Dynasty]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"20%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"45%\" | Comments\n! width=\"20%\" | Dates\n|-\n| [[Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep]] I\n| <center>[[File:Sekhemrekhutawy Sobekhotep Amenemhat.jpg|100px]]</center>\n| Founded the 13th Dynasty.

However, the specific title \"Pharaoh\" was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the rule of [[Merneptah]] in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]], c. 1200 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers, there was an [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary]] used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a [[Horus name]], a [[Prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|Sedge and Bee]] (''nswt-bjtj'') name and a Two Ladies (''nbtj'') name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.\n\nEgypt was continually governed, at least in part, by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years, until it was conquered by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] in the late 8th century BC, whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest, Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]], whose rulers also adopted the title of \"Pharaoh\". The last native pharaoh of Egypt was [[Nectanebo II]], who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time.\n\nAchaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, after which it was ruled by the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] Pharaohs of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Dynasty]]. Their rule, and the independence of Egypt, came to an end when Egypt became a province of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in 30 BC. [[Augustus]] and subsequent [[Roman emperor]]s were [[Roman pharaoh|styled as Pharaoh]] when in Egypt until the reign of [[Maximinus Daia]] in 314 AD.\n\nThe dates given in this '''list of pharaohs''' are approximate. They are based primarily on the [[conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt]], mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt//|title=Digital Egypt for Universities|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> database developed by the [[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]], but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately.{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Ancient Egyptian king lists ==\nModern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records, including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories, such as [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptiaca'', as well as archaeological evidence.

He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years, longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting [[famine]].\n\nThe kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties, who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty, tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years, they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. Some time after these events, a rival line based at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united [[Upper Egypt]]. Around 2055 BC, [[Mentuhotep II]], the son and successor of pharaoh [[Intef III]] defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands, thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.\n\n===Seventh and Eighth Dynasties (combined)===\n{{Main|Seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Seventh and Eighth Dynasties]] ruled for approximately 20\u201345 years (possibly 2181 to 2160 BC). They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] over a possibly divided Egypt and, in any case, holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved.\nThe list below is based on the [[Abydos King List]] dating to the reign of [[Seti I]] and taken from [[J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath]]'s ''Handbuch der \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigsnamen''<ref name=\"beck\">[[J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath]]: ''Handbuch der \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigsnamen'', M\u00fcnchner \u00e4gyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : P. von Zabern, 1999, {{ISBN|3-8053-2591-6}}, [http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4xjd6j4qed3c9vl available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222200801/http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4xjd6j4qed3c9vl |date=2015-12-22 }}</ref> as well as from [[Kim Ryholt]]'s latest reconstruction of the [[Turin King List|Turin canon]], another king list dating to the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Ramesside Era]].<ref name=\"ryholt2000\">[[Kim Ryholt]]: \"The Late Old Kingdom in the Turin King-list and the Identity of Nitocris\", Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00e4gyptische, 127, 2000, p. 99</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

He may be an ephemeral king, or a name variant of a king of the 12th or 13th Dynasty.\n\n==Second Intermediate Period==\n{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\nThe [[Second Intermediate Period]] (1802\u20131550 BC) is a period of disarray between the end of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], and the start of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. It is best known as when the [[Hyksos]], whose reign comprised the [[Fifteenth dynasty of Egypt|Fifteenth Dynasty]], made their appearance in Egypt.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] was much weaker than the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the provincial ruling family in [[Xois]], located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite [[Fourteenth dynasty of Egypt|Fourteenth Dynasty]].\n\nThe Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of [[Sobekhotep IV]], and around 1720 BC took control of the town of [[Avaris]] (the modern [[Tell el-Dab'a]]/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by [[Salitis]] the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], thereby terminating the 13th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter.\n\nSubsequently, as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]]. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and finally Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.\n\n===Thirteenth Dynasty===\n{{Main|Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] (following the [[Turin King List]]) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho. This table should be contrasted with [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt#Known|Known kings of the 13th Dynasty]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"20%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"45%\" | Comments\n! width=\"20%\" | Dates\n|-\n| [[Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep]] I\n| <center>[[File:Sekhemrekhutawy Sobekhotep Amenemhat.jpg|100px]]</center>\n| Founded the 13th Dynasty.

Many variants of the Spitfire were built, using several wing configurations, and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; nearly [[List of surviving Supermarine Spitfires|60 remain airworthy]], and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world.\n\nThe Spitfire was designed as a short-range, high-performance [[interceptor aircraft]] by [[R. J. Mitchell]], chief designer at [[Supermarine]] Aviation Works, which operated as a subsidiary of [[Vickers-Armstrong]] from 1928. Mitchell pushed the Spitfire's distinctive [[elliptical wing]] with cutting-edge sunken rivets (designed by [[Beverley Shenstone]])<ref>Bjorkman, James, \"[https://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2015/03/spitfire.html Supermarine Spitfire - Classic RAF Fighter],\" Filminspector.com, Retrieved 20 January 2019</ref> to have the thinnest possible cross-section, helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters, including the [[Hawker Hurricane]]. Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937, whereupon his colleague [[Joseph Smith (aircraft designer)|Joseph Smith]] took over as chief designer, overseeing the Spitfire's development throughout [[Supermarine Spitfire variants: specifications, performance and armament|its multitude of variants]].\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Britain]], from July to October 1940, the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against [[Nazi Germany]]'s air force, the [[Luftwaffe]]. However, Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire's higher performance. During the battle, Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters&mdash;mainly [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E|Messerschmitt Bf 109E]]-series aircraft, which were a close match for them.\n\nAfter the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of [[RAF Fighter Command]], and saw action in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European]], [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]], and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asian]] theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber, and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The [[Supermarine Seafire|Seafire]] was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire that served in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original [[airframe]] was designed to be powered by a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine producing 1,030&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (768&nbsp;kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] engines producing up to 2,340&nbsp;hp (1,745&nbsp;kW). As a result, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.\n\n==Development and production==\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1931 the Air Ministry released [[List Of Air Ministry Specifications|specification F7/30]], calling for a modern fighter capable of a flying speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. R. J. Mitchell designed the [[Supermarine Type 224]] to fill this role. The 224 was an open-cockpit monoplane with bulky gull-wings and a large, fixed, spatted [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] powered by the {{convert|600|hp|adj=on}}, [[Evaporative cooling (engine)|evaporatively cooled]] [[Rolls-Royce Goshawk]] engine.<ref>Ethell 1997, p. 6.</ref> It made its first flight in February 1934.<ref name=\"Andrews Supermarine, p. 206\">Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 206.</ref> Of the seven designs tendered to F7/30, the [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane was accepted for service.<ref name=\"document p. 16\">Price 1977, p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe Type 224 was a big disappointment to Mitchell and his design team, who immediately embarked on a series of \"cleaned-up\" designs, using their experience with the [[Schneider Trophy]] seaplanes as a starting point.<ref name=\"document p. 16\" /> This led to the Type 300, with retractable undercarriage and a wingspan reduced by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This design was submitted to the Air Ministry in July 1934, but was not accepted.<ref>Price 1982, p. 16.</ref> It then went through a series of changes, including the incorporation of an enclosed cockpit, oxygen-breathing apparatus, smaller and thinner wings, and the newly developed, more powerful Rolls-Royce [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|PV-XII]] V-12 engine, later named the \"Merlin\". In November 1934 Mitchell, with the backing of Supermarine's owner [[Vickers-Armstrong]], started detailed design work on this refined version of the Type 300.<ref>Price 1982, p. 17.</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 1934, the Air Ministry issued contract ''AM 361140/34'', providing \u00a310,000 for the construction of Mitchell's improved Type 300, design.<ref name=\"document p. 20\">Price 1977, p. 20.</ref> On 3 January 1935, they formalised the contract with a new specification, F10/35, written around the aircraft.<ref>Price 1999, pp. 16, 17.</ref> In April 1935, the armament was changed from two .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Vickers machine gun]]s in each wing to four .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Brownings]],<ref name=\"document p. 32\">Price 1977, p. 32.</ref> following a recommendation by Squadron Leader [[Ralph Sorley]] of the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry.<ref name=\"Glancey 2006, pp. 37\u201338\">Glancey 2006, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 1936,<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 27.</ref><ref group=nb>For many years, considerable debate occurred over the date of the first flight being 5 or 6 March.

Supermarine was a small company, already busy building [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] and [[Supermarine Stranraer|Stranraer]] flying boats, and Vickers was busy building [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] bombers.\n\nThe initial solution was to subcontract the work.<ref name=\"Price p. 61\" /> Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents.<ref name=autogenerated1>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 45.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that its production be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that production problems could be overcome, and a further order was placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938.

Once the trim was satisfactory, I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850&nbsp;rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature&nbsp;... If all appeared satisfactory, I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000&nbsp;rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at {{convert|460|mph|0|abbr=on}} IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.\nThe production test was usually quite a brisk affair; the initial circuit lasted less than ten minutes and the main flight took between twenty and thirty minutes. Then the aircraft received a final once-over by our ground mechanics, any faults were rectified and the Spitfire was ready for collection.\nI loved the Spitfire in all of her many versions. But I have to admit that the later marks, although they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less.

The French [[Dewoitine D.520]]<ref>Danel and Cuny 1966, pp. 225\u2013244.</ref> and the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of [[monocoque]] construction, and the availability of new, high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, and low-drag, all-metal wings. These advances had been introduced on civil airliners years before, but were slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMitchell's design aims were to create a well-balanced, high-performance fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting the power of the Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly.<ref name=\"Price 2002, p. 20\">Price 2002, p. 20.</ref> At the time, with [[Entente Cordiale|France as an ally]], and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain. German bombers would have to fly to the UK over the [[North Sea]], and Germany did not have any single-engine fighters with the range to accompany them. To carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to allow the Spitfire to climb quickly to intercept enemy bombers.<ref name=Bodie20>Bodie 1991, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe Spitfire's airframe was complex. The streamlined, [[semi-monocoque]], [[duralumin|duralumin-skinned]] fuselage featured a number of compound, vertical curves built up from a skeleton of 19 [[former]]s, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame five, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and its accessories. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead, and in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage [[longeron]]s to the rest of the airframe.<ref>Deere 2010, pp. 152\u2013153, 170.</ref> Behind the bulkhead were five U-shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the 11th frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating were attached, and ended at the 19th, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames was oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several [[lightening holes]] to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the [[Flight control surfaces|rudder]] post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, pp. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nA combination of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons attached to the frames helped form a light, but rigid structure to which sheets of [[alclad]] stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20, and 18 [[Sheet metal|gauge]] in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 616.</ref><!--Website no longer operating as free site--There was ample room for the camera equipment and additional fuel tanks which were to be fitted during the Spitfire's operational service life.<ref>[http://www.spitfirerestoration.com/ Spitfire construction].

From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 171.</ref> In some areas, such as at the rear of the wing and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of [[spruce]] bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers.<ref>Deere 2010, pp. 170\u2013172.</ref> At first, the ailerons, elevators, and rudder were fabric-covered, but combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, pp. 57\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Elliptical wing design===\n\nIn 1934, Mitchell and the design staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two conflicting requirements; the wing needed to be thin to avoid creating too much [[drag (physics)|drag]], but it had to be thick enough to house the retractable undercarriage, armament, and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of [[lift-induced drag|induced drag]]. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] position, aligned with the main spar, preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the [[Heinkel He 70]], which first flew in 1932, but as [[Beverley Shenstone]], the [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] on Mitchell's team, explained: \"Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section to that of the Heinkel. In any case, it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose.\"<ref name=\"document pp. 33\u201334\">Price 1977, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Glancey notes that Rolls-Royce saw the potential of the He 70 as a flying test-bed for prototype engines, sending a team to Germany to buy one of the aircraft direct from Heinkel.

As the wing thinned out along its span, the tubes were progressively cut away in a similar fashion to a [[leaf spring]]; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar.<ref name=\"Price 2002, p. 19.\">Price 2002, p. 19.</ref> The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar, and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure.

In early marks of the Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI), the single flap was operated manually using a lever to the left of the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mk IX]], the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing, a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit.

The trailing edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the [[Angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] decreasing from +2\u00b0 at its root to -\u00bd\u00b0 at its tip.<ref name=\"Andrews super, p. 216\">Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 216.</ref> This caused the wing roots to [[stall (aerodynamic)|stall]] before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise have resulted in a wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly it to the limits of its performance.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 78</ref> This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224, and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 4.</ref> The complex wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, caused some major delays in the production of the Spitfire at first. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.<ref>McKinstry 2007, pp. 79, 133.</ref>\n\nAll the main flight controls were originally metal structures with fabric covering.{{#tag:ref|The fabric used for aircraft control surfaces had to be as light and as strong as possible: [[Irish linen]] was often used, or Grade A cotton.

Air combat was also felt to take place at relatively low speeds and high-speed manoeuvring would be physically impossible. Flight tests showed the fabric covering of the ailerons \"ballooned\" at high speeds, adversely affecting the aerodynamics. Replacing the fabric covering with light alloy dramatically improved the ailerons at high speed.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 260.</ref><ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 88.</ref> During the Battle of Britain, pilots found the Spitfire's ailerons were far too heavy at high speeds, severely restricting lateral manoeuvres such as rolls and high-speed turns, which were still a feature of air-to-air combat.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 110.</ref>\n\n[[File:Spitfire VII Langley USA.jpg|thumb|left|Spitfire HF Mk VII: The shape of the ellipse was altered by the extended \"pointed\" wing tips used by the high-altitude Mk VIs, VIIs, and early Mk VIIIs.]]\nThe Spitfire had detachable wing tips which were secured by two mounting points at the end of each main wing assembly. When the Spitfire took on a role as a high-altitude fighter (Marks VI and VII and some early Mk VIIIs), the standard wing tips were replaced by extended, \"pointed\" tips which increased the wingspan from {{convert|36|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Price 1982, p. 147.</ref> The other wing-tip variation, used by several Spitfire variants, was the \"clipped\" wing; the standard wing tips were replaced by wooden fairings which reduced the span by {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Price 1982, p. 144.</ref> The wing tips used spruce formers for most of the internal structure with a light alloy skin attached using brass screws.<ref>Deere 2010, p. 173.</ref>\n\nThe light alloy [[Flap (aircraft)|split flaps]] at the trailing edge of the wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel.<ref>Air Publications 1972, p. 5.</ref> Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85\u00b0). Flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.{{#tag:ref|On the ground, the flaps were normally lowered only for inspection or for maintenance. Pilots who forgot to raise the flaps after landing often found themselves paying a fine.|group=nb}}<ref>Tanner 1981, p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe ellipse also served as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and tailplane assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical, and later, horizontal tail surfaces to compensate for the altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series, which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.<ref>Dibbs and Holmes 1997, p. 190.</ref><ref>Tanner 1976, p. Section 1, Fig. 1.</ref>\n\n===Improved late wing designs===\nAs the Spitfire gained more power and was able to manoeuvre at higher speeds, the possibility that pilots would encounter [[Control reversal|aileron reversal]] increased, and the Supermarine design team set about redesigning the wings to counter this. The original wing design had a ''theoretical'' aileron reversal speed of {{convert|580|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Quill 1983, p. 272.\">Quill 1983, p. 272.</ref> which was somewhat lower than that of some contemporary fighters. The Royal Aircraft Establishment noted that, at {{convert|400|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]], roughly 65% of aileron effectiveness was lost due to wing twist.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1947/naca-report-868.pdf \"NACA Report on lateral control research, p. 131.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226115623/http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1947/naca-report-868.pdf |date=26 February 2009 }} ''naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk.''.

This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply \"bunt\" into a high-power dive to escape an attack, leaving the Spitfire behind, as its fuel was forced out of the [[carburettor]] by [[g-force|negative \"g\"]]. RAF fighter pilots soon learned to \"half-roll\" their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 205.</ref> Sir [[Stanley Hooker]] explained the carburettor was adopted because it \"increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine\".<ref name=\"McKinstry 2007, p. 206.\">McKinstry 2007, p. 206.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Early, Merlin-powered Spitfires were not the only aircraft to suffer from this problem, as other prewar aeroplanes also used carburettors containing a float chamber. In 1942, the United States acquired a flyable, Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], known as the ''[[Akutan Zero]]''. Test flying showed this aircraft also suffered engine cut-outs, due to the float-type carburettor of its ''[[Nakajima Sakae]]'' engine. The Americans devised tactics to counter the Zero in combat that took advantage of this and other results of testing the aircraft.<ref>Rearden (1995), p.73</ref>\n.|group=nb}}\n\nIn March 1941, a metal disc with a hole was fitted in the fuel line, restricting fuel flow to the maximum the engine could consume. While it did not cure the problem of the initial [[fuel starvation]] in a dive, it did reduce the more serious problem of the carburettor being flooded with fuel by the fuel pumps under negative \"g\". Invented by [[Beatrice Shilling|Beatrice \"Tilly\" Shilling]], it became known as \"[[Miss Shilling's orifice]]\". Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin series, with [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]]-manufactured [[pressure carburettor]]s, designed to allow fuel to flow during all flight attitudes, introduced in 1942.<ref name=\"McKinstry 2007, p. 206.\" />\n\n===Armament===\n\n[[File:Spitfire (At Wright-Patterson).jpg|thumb|Spitfire at the National Museum of the United States Air Force]]\n\nDue to a shortage of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later.<ref name=\"Williams p. 93\">Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 93.</ref> Early tests showed that, while the guns worked perfectly on the ground and at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns, because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented [[Cooking off|overheating]] of the [[cordite]] used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 16, 93-94\">Williams and Gustin 2003, pp. 16, 93\u201394.</ref> Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts from the rear of the wing-mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were [[Aircraft dope|doped]] over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt, and moisture until they were fired.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\">Williams and Gustin 2003, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nThe decision on the arming of the Spitfire (and the Hurricane) is told in Captain C. H. Keith's book ''I Hold my Aim''. Keith held various appointments with the RAF dealing with designing, development and technical policy of armament equipment. He organised a conference, with Air Commodore Tedder in the chair, on 19 July 1934. He says \"I think it can be reasonably contended that the deliberations of that conference made possible, if not certain, of the winning of the Battle of Britain, almost exactly six years later\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRUZAAAAIAAJ|title=I Hold My Aim|last=Keith|first=Claude Hilton|publisher=G. Allen and Unwin Limited|year=1946|isbn=|location=|page=78|pages=}}</ref> At that meeting, scientific officer [[Frederick William Hill|Captain F. W. \"Gunner\" Hill]] presented charts based on his calculations showing that future fighters must carry no less than eight machine-guns, each of which must be capable of firing 1,000 shots a minute. Hill's assistant in making his calculations had been his teenage daughter.<ref name=\"Keith C.H. p. 128\">Keith 1946, p. 128.</ref>\n\nEven if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20&nbsp;mm was urgently needed.<ref name=\"Williams p. 95\">Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 95.</ref> A variant on the Spitfire design with four 20&nbsp;mm [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon cannon]] had been tendered to specification F37/35, but the order for prototypes had gone to the [[Westland Whirlwind (fighter)|Westland Whirlwind]] in January 1939.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 35, 50.</ref>\n\nIn June 1939, a Spitfire was fitted with a drum-fed [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#British production|Hispano]] in each wing, an installation that required large blisters on the wing to cover the 60-round drum. The cannon suffered frequent stoppages, mostly because the guns were mounted on their sides to fit as much of the magazine as possible within the wing. In January 1940, P/O George Proudman flew this prototype in combat, but the starboard gun stopped after firing a single round, while the port gun fired 30 rounds before seizing.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\" /> If one cannon seized, the recoil of the other threw the aircraft off aim.\n\nNevertheless, 30 more cannon-armed Spitfires were ordered for operational trials, and they were soon known as the Mk IB, to distinguish them from the Browning-armed Mk IA; they were delivered to No. 19 Squadron beginning in June 1940. The Hispanos were found to be so unreliable that the squadron requested an exchange of its aircraft with the older Browning-armed aircraft of an operational training unit. By August, Supermarine had perfected a more reliable installation with an improved feed mechanism and four .303s in the outer wing panels. The modified fighters were then delivered to 19 Squadron.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\" />\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Service operations===\n{{Main|Supermarine Spitfire operational history}}\n[[File:SpitI19a.jpg|thumb|''K9795'', the 9th production Mk I, with [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] in 1938]]\nThe operational history of the Spitfire with the RAF began with the first Mk Is ''K9789'', which entered service with [[No. XIX Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] at [[Duxford Aerodrome|RAF Duxford]] on 4 August 1938.<ref name=\"Price p. 67\" />{{#tag:ref|This aircraft survived the war, only to be scrapped in 1945.

For example, the Spitfire became the first high-speed [[Reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] aircraft to be operated by the RAF. Sometimes unarmed, they flew at high, medium, and low altitudes, often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the [[Axis powers]] and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war.\n\nIn 1941 and 1942, PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the ''[[Freya radar|Freya]]'' and [[W\u00fcrzburg radar|''W\u00fcrzburg'' radar]] systems, and in 1943, helped confirm that the Germans were building the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] ''[[Vergeltungswaffen]]'' (\"vengeance weapons\") rockets by photographing [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the [[Baltic Sea]] coast of Germany.<ref>Vader 1969, p. 153.</ref>\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the Spitfire blunted the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|heavy attacks on Malta]] by the [[Regia Aeronautica]] and Luftwaffe, and from early 1943, helped pave the way for the Allied invasions of [[Sicily]] and Italy.

These covered the Spitfire in development from the Merlin to [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]] engines, the high-speed photo-reconnaissance variants and the different wing configurations. More Spitfire Mk Vs were built than any other type, with 6,487 built, followed by the 5,656 Mk IXs.<ref name=\"Air International 1985\" /> Different wings, featuring a variety of weapons, were fitted to most marks; the A wing used eight .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, the B wing had four .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns and two 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano cannon]], and the C, or universal, wing could mount either four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon or two 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) and four .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns.

Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations on the use of the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire.<ref>Brown 1978, p. 181.</ref> Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations.<ref name=\"Glancey p. 108\">Glancey 2006, p. 108.</ref> Early Seafire marks had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.<ref>Brown 1978, p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe Seafire II was able to outperform the [[Mitsubishi Zero|A6M5 Zero]] at low altitudes when the two types were tested against each other during wartime mock combat exercises.<ref name=\"Price WoF pt2, p. 40\">Price ''Wings of Fame'' 1999, p. 40.</ref> However, contemporary Allied carrier fighters such as the [[F6F Hellcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] were considerably more robust and so more practical for carrier operations.<ref name=\"Price WoF pt 2, p. 36\">Price ''Wings of Fame'' 1999, p. 36.</ref> Performance was greatly increased when later versions of the Seafire were fitted with the Griffon engines.

At the time, British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|action against Indonesia over Malaya]] and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang, a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19.<ref name=\"Green p. 91\">Green 2007, p. 91.</ref> The first airframe (PM631) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial.

It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook, and after a short time was participating in the trials. At the end of the trials, RAF pilots found that [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature, and decided that the twin ADEN {{convert|30|mm|0|abbr=on}} cannons were the only weapons suited to the task, which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire, and the Lightning's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire. It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire, and circle behind it to perform a hit-and-run attack, contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time.<ref>McKinstry 2007, pp. 379\u201380.</ref><ref name=\"Price p. 158\">Price 1991, p. 158.</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n{{See also|List of Supermarine Spitfire operators}}\n[[File:Spitfires of the No 352 (Y) Squadron RAF, aka Balkan Air Force (18 August 1944).jpg|thumb|right|Spitfires Mk Vc (Trop) of [[No. 352 Squadron RAF|352 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF]] ([[Balkan Air Force]]) before first mission on 18 August 1944, from [[Canne]] airfield, Italy]]\n\n[[File:Supermarine 509 Spitfire T9C AN1067997.jpg|thumb|Spitfire T9 in 2005, civil registered as G-CCCA, painted in the markings of the [[Irish Air Corps]]]]\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{ARG}} (two, ex-civilian, test only)\n* {{AUS}}<ref>http://www.adf-serials.com.au/2a58.htm</ref><ref>http://www.adf-serials.com.au/spitfire.htm</ref>\n* {{BEL}}\n* {{flag|Burma|1948}}\n* {{flag|Canada|1921}}\n* {{CZS}}\n* {{DNK}}\n* {{flag|Egypt|1922}}\n* {{FRA}}\n* {{flag|Free France}}\n* {{flag|Greece|old}}\n* {{flag|Hong Kong|1959}}\n* {{flag|India}}\n* {{flagicon|British Raj}} [[Indian Empire]]\n* {{IDN}}\n* {{IRL}}\n* {{ISR}}\n|\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* {{flag|Italy}} (Italian Republic)\n* {{NLD}}\n* {{NZL}}\n* {{NOR}}\n* {{PAK}}\n* {{POL}}\n* {{POR}}\n* {{flag|Rhodesia}}\n* {{flag|South Africa|1928}}\n* {{USSR}}\n* {{SWE}}\n* {{flag|Syria|1932}}\n* {{THA}}\n* {{TUR}}\n* {{UK}}\n* {{flag|United States|1912}}\n* {{YUG}}\n|}\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n{{Main|List of surviving Supermarine Spitfires}}\n[[File:Spitfire AR614 Paul Allen Collection.jpg|thumb|[[Lynn Garrison]] Spitfire AR614 now in Paul Allen Collection]]\n\nThere are 54 Spitfires and a few Seafires in airworthy condition worldwide, although many air museums have examples on static display, for example, Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R-2/Trop.

Many variants of the Spitfire were built, using several wing configurations, and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; nearly [[List of surviving Supermarine Spitfires|60 remain airworthy]], and many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world.\n\nThe Spitfire was designed as a short-range, high-performance [[interceptor aircraft]] by [[R. J. Mitchell]], chief designer at [[Supermarine]] Aviation Works, which operated as a subsidiary of [[Vickers-Armstrong]] from 1928. Mitchell pushed the Spitfire's distinctive [[elliptical wing]] with cutting-edge sunken rivets (designed by [[Beverley Shenstone]])<ref>Bjorkman, James, \"[https://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2015/03/spitfire.html Supermarine Spitfire - Classic RAF Fighter],\" Filminspector.com, Retrieved 20 January 2019</ref> to have the thinnest possible cross-section, helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters, including the [[Hawker Hurricane]]. Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937, whereupon his colleague [[Joseph Smith (aircraft designer)|Joseph Smith]] took over as chief designer, overseeing the Spitfire's development throughout [[Supermarine Spitfire variants: specifications, performance and armament|its multitude of variants]].\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Britain]], from July to October 1940, the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against [[Nazi Germany]]'s air force, the [[Luftwaffe]]. However, Spitfire units had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire's higher performance. During the battle, Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fighters&mdash;mainly [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E|Messerschmitt Bf 109E]]-series aircraft, which were a close match for them.\n\nAfter the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of [[RAF Fighter Command]], and saw action in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European]], [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]], and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asian]] theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber, and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The [[Supermarine Seafire|Seafire]] was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire that served in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original [[airframe]] was designed to be powered by a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine producing 1,030&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (768&nbsp;kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] engines producing up to 2,340&nbsp;hp (1,745&nbsp;kW). As a result, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.\n\n==Development and production==\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1931 the Air Ministry released [[List Of Air Ministry Specifications|specification F7/30]], calling for a modern fighter capable of a flying speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. R. J. Mitchell designed the [[Supermarine Type 224]] to fill this role. The 224 was an open-cockpit monoplane with bulky gull-wings and a large, fixed, spatted [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] powered by the {{convert|600|hp|adj=on}}, [[Evaporative cooling (engine)|evaporatively cooled]] [[Rolls-Royce Goshawk]] engine.<ref>Ethell 1997, p. 6.</ref> It made its first flight in February 1934.<ref name=\"Andrews Supermarine, p. 206\">Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 206.</ref> Of the seven designs tendered to F7/30, the [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane was accepted for service.<ref name=\"document p. 16\">Price 1977, p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe Type 224 was a big disappointment to Mitchell and his design team, who immediately embarked on a series of \"cleaned-up\" designs, using their experience with the [[Schneider Trophy]] seaplanes as a starting point.<ref name=\"document p. 16\" /> This led to the Type 300, with retractable undercarriage and a wingspan reduced by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This design was submitted to the Air Ministry in July 1934, but was not accepted.<ref>Price 1982, p. 16.</ref> It then went through a series of changes, including the incorporation of an enclosed cockpit, oxygen-breathing apparatus, smaller and thinner wings, and the newly developed, more powerful Rolls-Royce [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|PV-XII]] V-12 engine, later named the \"Merlin\". In November 1934 Mitchell, with the backing of Supermarine's owner [[Vickers-Armstrong]], started detailed design work on this refined version of the Type 300.<ref>Price 1982, p. 17.</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 1934, the Air Ministry issued contract ''AM 361140/34'', providing \u00a310,000 for the construction of Mitchell's improved Type 300, design.<ref name=\"document p. 20\">Price 1977, p. 20.</ref> On 3 January 1935, they formalised the contract with a new specification, F10/35, written around the aircraft.<ref>Price 1999, pp. 16, 17.</ref> In April 1935, the armament was changed from two .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Vickers machine gun]]s in each wing to four .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Brownings]],<ref name=\"document p. 32\">Price 1977, p. 32.</ref> following a recommendation by Squadron Leader [[Ralph Sorley]] of the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry.<ref name=\"Glancey 2006, pp. 37\u201338\">Glancey 2006, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 1936,<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 27.</ref><ref group=nb>For many years, considerable debate occurred over the date of the first flight being 5 or 6 March.

Although full-scale production was supposed to begin immediately, numerous problems could not be overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, ''K9787'', did not roll off the [[Woolston, Hampshire|Woolston]], Southampton assembly line until mid-1938.<ref name=\"Ethell p. 12\">Ethel 1997, p. 12.</ref>\n\nIn February 1936 the director of Vickers-Armstrong, Sir Robert MacLean guaranteed production of five aircraft a week, beginning 15 months after an order was placed. On 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 aircraft, at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,395,000.<ref name=\"Price p. 61\">Price 1982, p. 61.</ref> Full-scale production of the Spitfire began at Supermarine's facility in Woolston, but the order clearly could not be completed in the 15 months promised. Supermarine was a small company, already busy building [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] and [[Supermarine Stranraer|Stranraer]] flying boats, and Vickers was busy building [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] bombers.\n\nThe initial solution was to subcontract the work.<ref name=\"Price p. 61\" /> Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents.<ref name=autogenerated1>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 45.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that its production be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that production problems could be overcome, and a further order was placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L, and N prefix serial numbers.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe first production Spitfire came off the assembly line in mid-1938<ref name=\"Ethell p. 12\" /> and was flown by Jeffrey Quill on 15 May 1938, almost 24 months after the initial order.<ref>Price 1982, p. 65.</ref> The final cost of the first 310 aircraft, after delays and increased programme costs, came to \u00a31,870,242 or \u00a31,533 more per aircraft than originally estimated.<ref name=\"Price p. 67\">Price 1982, p. 67.</ref> A production aircraft cost about \u00a39,500.

Once the trim was satisfactory, I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850&nbsp;rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature&nbsp;... If all appeared satisfactory, I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000&nbsp;rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at {{convert|460|mph|0|abbr=on}} IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.\nThe production test was usually quite a brisk affair; the initial circuit lasted less than ten minutes and the main flight took between twenty and thirty minutes. Then the aircraft received a final once-over by our ground mechanics, any faults were rectified and the Spitfire was ready for collection.\nI loved the Spitfire in all of her many versions. But I have to admit that the later marks, although they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less.

The French [[Dewoitine D.520]]<ref>Danel and Cuny 1966, pp. 225\u2013244.</ref> and the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of [[monocoque]] construction, and the availability of new, high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, and low-drag, all-metal wings. These advances had been introduced on civil airliners years before, but were slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMitchell's design aims were to create a well-balanced, high-performance fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting the power of the Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly.<ref name=\"Price 2002, p. 20\">Price 2002, p. 20.</ref> At the time, with [[Entente Cordiale|France as an ally]], and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain. German bombers would have to fly to the UK over the [[North Sea]], and Germany did not have any single-engine fighters with the range to accompany them. To carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to allow the Spitfire to climb quickly to intercept enemy bombers.<ref name=Bodie20>Bodie 1991, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe Spitfire's airframe was complex. The streamlined, [[semi-monocoque]], [[duralumin|duralumin-skinned]] fuselage featured a number of compound, vertical curves built up from a skeleton of 19 [[former]]s, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame five, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and its accessories. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead, and in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage [[longeron]]s to the rest of the airframe.<ref>Deere 2010, pp. 152\u2013153, 170.</ref> Behind the bulkhead were five U-shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the 11th frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating were attached, and ended at the 19th, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames was oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several [[lightening holes]] to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the [[Flight control surfaces|rudder]] post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, pp. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nA combination of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons attached to the frames helped form a light, but rigid structure to which sheets of [[alclad]] stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20, and 18 [[Sheet metal|gauge]] in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 616.</ref><!--Website no longer operating as free site--There was ample room for the camera equipment and additional fuel tanks which were to be fitted during the Spitfire's operational service life.<ref>[http://www.spitfirerestoration.com/ Spitfire construction].

From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 171.</ref> In some areas, such as at the rear of the wing and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of [[spruce]] bolted to the lower ribs.

An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of [[lift-induced drag|induced drag]]. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] position, aligned with the main spar, preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the [[Heinkel He 70]], which first flew in 1932, but as [[Beverley Shenstone]], the [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] on Mitchell's team, explained: \"Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section to that of the Heinkel. In any case, it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose.\"<ref name=\"document pp. 33\u201334\">Price 1977, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Glancey notes that Rolls-Royce saw the potential of the He 70 as a flying test-bed for prototype engines, sending a team to Germany to buy one of the aircraft direct from Heinkel.

At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was intended to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% [[Ethylene glycol|glycol]].{{#tag:ref|Starting with the Merlin XII fitted in Spitfire Mk IIs in late 1940 this was changed to a 70% water-30% glycol mix.|group=nb}} The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by [[Fredrick Meredith]] of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) at [[Farnborough, Hampshire]].

In early marks of the Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI), the single flap was operated manually using a lever to the left of the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mk IX]], the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing, a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit.

The trailing edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the [[Angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] decreasing from +2\u00b0 at its root to -\u00bd\u00b0 at its tip.<ref name=\"Andrews super, p. 216\">Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 216.</ref> This caused the wing roots to [[stall (aerodynamic)|stall]] before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise have resulted in a wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly it to the limits of its performance.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 78</ref> This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224, and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire.<ref>Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 4.</ref> The complex wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, caused some major delays in the production of the Spitfire at first. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.<ref>McKinstry 2007, pp. 79, 133.</ref>\n\nAll the main flight controls were originally metal structures with fabric covering.{{#tag:ref|The fabric used for aircraft control surfaces had to be as light and as strong as possible: [[Irish linen]] was often used, or Grade A cotton.

Air combat was also felt to take place at relatively low speeds and high-speed manoeuvring would be physically impossible. Flight tests showed the fabric covering of the ailerons \"ballooned\" at high speeds, adversely affecting the aerodynamics. Replacing the fabric covering with light alloy dramatically improved the ailerons at high speed.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 260.</ref><ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 88.</ref> During the Battle of Britain, pilots found the Spitfire's ailerons were far too heavy at high speeds, severely restricting lateral manoeuvres such as rolls and high-speed turns, which were still a feature of air-to-air combat.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 110.</ref>\n\n[[File:Spitfire VII Langley USA.jpg|thumb|left|Spitfire HF Mk VII: The shape of the ellipse was altered by the extended \"pointed\" wing tips used by the high-altitude Mk VIs, VIIs, and early Mk VIIIs.]]\nThe Spitfire had detachable wing tips which were secured by two mounting points at the end of each main wing assembly.

Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical, and later, horizontal tail surfaces to compensate for the altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series, which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.<ref>Dibbs and Holmes 1997, p. 190.</ref><ref>Tanner 1976, p.

This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply \"bunt\" into a high-power dive to escape an attack, leaving the Spitfire behind, as its fuel was forced out of the [[carburettor]] by [[g-force|negative \"g\"]]. RAF fighter pilots soon learned to \"half-roll\" their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 205.</ref> Sir [[Stanley Hooker]] explained the carburettor was adopted because it \"increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine\".<ref name=\"McKinstry 2007, p. 206.\">McKinstry 2007, p. 206.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Early, Merlin-powered Spitfires were not the only aircraft to suffer from this problem, as other prewar aeroplanes also used carburettors containing a float chamber. In 1942, the United States acquired a flyable, Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], known as the ''[[Akutan Zero]]''. Test flying showed this aircraft also suffered engine cut-outs, due to the float-type carburettor of its ''[[Nakajima Sakae]]'' engine. The Americans devised tactics to counter the Zero in combat that took advantage of this and other results of testing the aircraft.<ref>Rearden (1995), p.73</ref>\n.|group=nb}}\n\nIn March 1941, a metal disc with a hole was fitted in the fuel line, restricting fuel flow to the maximum the engine could consume. While it did not cure the problem of the initial [[fuel starvation]] in a dive, it did reduce the more serious problem of the carburettor being flooded with fuel by the fuel pumps under negative \"g\". Invented by [[Beatrice Shilling|Beatrice \"Tilly\" Shilling]], it became known as \"[[Miss Shilling's orifice]]\". Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin series, with [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]]-manufactured [[pressure carburettor]]s, designed to allow fuel to flow during all flight attitudes, introduced in 1942.<ref name=\"McKinstry 2007, p. 206.\" />\n\n===Armament===\n\n[[File:Spitfire (At Wright-Patterson).jpg|thumb|Spitfire at the National Museum of the United States Air Force]]\n\nDue to a shortage of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later.<ref name=\"Williams p. 93\">Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 93.</ref> Early tests showed that, while the guns worked perfectly on the ground and at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns, because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented [[Cooking off|overheating]] of the [[cordite]] used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 16, 93-94\">Williams and Gustin 2003, pp. 16, 93\u201394.</ref> Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts from the rear of the wing-mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were [[Aircraft dope|doped]] over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt, and moisture until they were fired.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\">Williams and Gustin 2003, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nThe decision on the arming of the Spitfire (and the Hurricane) is told in Captain C. H. Keith's book ''I Hold my Aim''. Keith held various appointments with the RAF dealing with designing, development and technical policy of armament equipment. He organised a conference, with Air Commodore Tedder in the chair, on 19 July 1934. He says \"I think it can be reasonably contended that the deliberations of that conference made possible, if not certain, of the winning of the Battle of Britain, almost exactly six years later\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRUZAAAAIAAJ|title=I Hold My Aim|last=Keith|first=Claude Hilton|publisher=G. Allen and Unwin Limited|year=1946|isbn=|location=|page=78|pages=}}</ref> At that meeting, scientific officer [[Frederick William Hill|Captain F. W. \"Gunner\" Hill]] presented charts based on his calculations showing that future fighters must carry no less than eight machine-guns, each of which must be capable of firing 1,000 shots a minute. Hill's assistant in making his calculations had been his teenage daughter.<ref name=\"Keith C.H. p. 128\">Keith 1946, p. 128.</ref>\n\nEven if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20&nbsp;mm was urgently needed.<ref name=\"Williams p. 95\">Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 95.</ref> A variant on the Spitfire design with four 20&nbsp;mm [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon cannon]] had been tendered to specification F37/35, but the order for prototypes had gone to the [[Westland Whirlwind (fighter)|Westland Whirlwind]] in January 1939.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 35, 50.</ref>\n\nIn June 1939, a Spitfire was fitted with a drum-fed [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404#British production|Hispano]] in each wing, an installation that required large blisters on the wing to cover the 60-round drum. The cannon suffered frequent stoppages, mostly because the guns were mounted on their sides to fit as much of the magazine as possible within the wing. In January 1940, P/O George Proudman flew this prototype in combat, but the starboard gun stopped after firing a single round, while the port gun fired 30 rounds before seizing.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\" /> If one cannon seized, the recoil of the other threw the aircraft off aim.\n\nNevertheless, 30 more cannon-armed Spitfires were ordered for operational trials, and they were soon known as the Mk IB, to distinguish them from the Browning-armed Mk IA; they were delivered to No. 19 Squadron beginning in June 1940. The Hispanos were found to be so unreliable that the squadron requested an exchange of its aircraft with the older Browning-armed aircraft of an operational training unit. By August, Supermarine had perfected a more reliable installation with an improved feed mechanism and four .303s in the outer wing panels. The modified fighters were then delivered to 19 Squadron.<ref name=\"Williams pp. 93\u20134\" />\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Service operations===\n{{Main|Supermarine Spitfire operational history}}\n[[File:SpitI19a.jpg|thumb|''K9795'', the 9th production Mk I, with [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] in 1938]]\nThe operational history of the Spitfire with the RAF began with the first Mk Is ''K9789'', which entered service with [[No. XIX Squadron RAF|19 Squadron]] at [[Duxford Aerodrome|RAF Duxford]] on 4 August 1938.<ref name=\"Price p. 67\" />{{#tag:ref|This aircraft survived the war, only to be scrapped in 1945.

For example, the Spitfire became the first high-speed [[Reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] aircraft to be operated by the RAF. Sometimes unarmed, they flew at high, medium, and low altitudes, often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the [[Axis powers]] and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war.\n\nIn 1941 and 1942, PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the ''[[Freya radar|Freya]]'' and [[W\u00fcrzburg radar|''W\u00fcrzburg'' radar]] systems, and in 1943, helped confirm that the Germans were building the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] ''[[Vergeltungswaffen]]'' (\"vengeance weapons\") rockets by photographing [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the [[Baltic Sea]] coast of Germany.<ref>Vader 1969, p. 153.</ref>\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the Spitfire blunted the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|heavy attacks on Malta]] by the [[Regia Aeronautica]] and Luftwaffe, and from early 1943, helped pave the way for the Allied invasions of [[Sicily]] and Italy.

Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations on the use of the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire.<ref>Brown 1978, p. 181.</ref> Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations.<ref name=\"Glancey p. 108\">Glancey 2006, p. 108.</ref> Early Seafire marks had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.<ref>Brown 1978, p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe Seafire II was able to outperform the [[Mitsubishi Zero|A6M5 Zero]] at low altitudes when the two types were tested against each other during wartime mock combat exercises.<ref name=\"Price WoF pt2, p. 40\">Price ''Wings of Fame'' 1999, p. 40.</ref> However, contemporary Allied carrier fighters such as the [[F6F Hellcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] were considerably more robust and so more practical for carrier operations.<ref name=\"Price WoF pt 2, p. 36\">Price ''Wings of Fame'' 1999, p. 36.</ref> Performance was greatly increased when later versions of the Seafire were fitted with the Griffon engines.

At the time, British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|action against Indonesia over Malaya]] and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang, a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19.<ref name=\"Green p. 91\">Green 2007, p. 91.</ref> The first airframe (PM631) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial. Another PR Mk 19, ''PS853'', which is now owned by Rolls-Royce, was on gate-guard duties at Binbrook, having been retired from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) one year before. It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook, and after a short time was participating in the trials. At the end of the trials, RAF pilots found that [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature, and decided that the twin ADEN {{convert|30|mm|0|abbr=on}} cannons were the only weapons suited to the task, which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire, and the Lightning's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire. It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire, and circle behind it to perform a hit-and-run attack, contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time.<ref>McKinstry 2007, pp. 379\u201380.</ref><ref name=\"Price p. 158\">Price 1991, p. 158.</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n{{See also|List of Supermarine Spitfire operators}}\n[[File:Spitfires of the No 352 (Y) Squadron RAF, aka Balkan Air Force (18 August 1944).jpg|thumb|right|Spitfires Mk Vc (Trop) of [[No. 352 Squadron RAF|352 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF]] ([[Balkan Air Force]]) before first mission on 18 August 1944, from [[Canne]] airfield, Italy]]\n\n[[File:Supermarine 509 Spitfire T9C AN1067997.jpg|thumb|Spitfire T9 in 2005, civil registered as G-CCCA, painted in the markings of the [[Irish Air Corps]]]]\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{ARG}} (two, ex-civilian, test only)\n* {{AUS}}<ref>http://www.adf-serials.com.au/2a58.htm</ref><ref>http://www.adf-serials.com.au/spitfire.htm</ref>\n* {{BEL}}\n* {{flag|Burma|1948}}\n* {{flag|Canada|1921}}\n* {{CZS}}\n* {{DNK}}\n* {{flag|Egypt|1922}}\n* {{FRA}}\n* {{flag|Free France}}\n* {{flag|Greece|old}}\n* {{flag|Hong Kong|1959}}\n* {{flag|India}}\n* {{flagicon|British Raj}} [[Indian Empire]]\n* {{IDN}}\n* {{IRL}}\n* {{ISR}}\n|\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* {{flag|Italy}} (Italian Republic)\n* {{NLD}}\n* {{NZL}}\n* {{NOR}}\n* {{PAK}}\n* {{POL}}\n* {{POR}}\n* {{flag|Rhodesia}}\n* {{flag|South Africa|1928}}\n* {{USSR}}\n* {{SWE}}\n* {{flag|Syria|1932}}\n* {{THA}}\n* {{TUR}}\n* {{UK}}\n* {{flag|United States|1912}}\n* {{YUG}}\n|}\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n{{Main|List of surviving Supermarine Spitfires}}\n[[File:Spitfire AR614 Paul Allen Collection.jpg|thumb|[[Lynn Garrison]] Spitfire AR614 now in Paul Allen Collection]]\n\nThere are 54 Spitfires and a few Seafires in airworthy condition worldwide, although many air museums have examples on static display, for example, Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R-2/Trop.

The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first [[hung parliament]] in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first [[coalition government]] since the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration led by [[Gordon Brown]] was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[David Cameron]] won the largest number of seats in the [[List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election|new Parliament]], but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Nick Clegg]], aimed at forming a coalition government.\n\nAs leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The [[Scottish National Party]] signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that [[Gordon Brown]]'s continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour\u2013Liberal Democrat deal.\n\nAlthough Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat Coalition government]] led by [[David Cameron]] took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \"approved overwhelmingly\" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] was appointed as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Premiership of Tony Blair|Premiership of Gordon Brown|New Labour}}\n\nThe Labour Party came into government under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|May 1997]] after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by [[John Major]]; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lawless |first=Jill |last2=Quinn |first2=Jennifer |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FKGLS00.htm |title=Brown waited a decade for chance to lead |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Alberici |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-08/fears-british-minority-government-wont-last/426972 |title=Fears British minority government won't last |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030060548/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-08/fears-british-minority-government-wont-last/426972 |archivedate=30 October 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"Economist-2010-04-29\">{{cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/16004271|url-access= limited|title= Things could only get better|newspaper= The Economist|date= 29 April 2010|accessdate= 4 November 2012|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130214194735/http://www.economist.com/node/16004271|archivedate= 14 February 2013}}</ref> Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Neather |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/glory-days-are-over--labour-needs-to-reinvent-itself-6466986.html |title=Glory days are over&nbsp;...

election|the 2010 general election]], which failed to produce an overall majority for any of the country's two main political parties. The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first [[hung parliament]] in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first [[coalition government]] since the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration led by [[Gordon Brown]] was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[David Cameron]] won the largest number of seats in the [[List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election|new Parliament]], but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Nick Clegg]], aimed at forming a coalition government.\n\nAs leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The [[Scottish National Party]] signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that [[Gordon Brown]]'s continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour\u2013Liberal Democrat deal.\n\nAlthough Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat Coalition government]] led by [[David Cameron]] took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \"approved overwhelmingly\" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] was appointed as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Premiership of Tony Blair|Premiership of Gordon Brown|New Labour}}\n\nThe Labour Party came into government under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|May 1997]] after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by [[John Major]]; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lawless |first=Jill |last2=Quinn |first2=Jennifer |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FKGLS00.htm |title=Brown waited a decade for chance to lead |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Alberici |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-08/fears-british-minority-government-wont-last/426972 |title=Fears British minority government won't last |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030060548/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-08/fears-british-minority-government-wont-last/426972 |archivedate=30 October 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"Economist-2010-04-29\">{{cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/16004271|url-access= limited|title= Things could only get better|newspaper= The Economist|date= 29 April 2010|accessdate= 4 November 2012|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130214194735/http://www.economist.com/node/16004271|archivedate= 14 February 2013}}</ref> Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Neather |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/glory-days-are-over--labour-needs-to-reinvent-itself-6466986.html |title=Glory days are over&nbsp;...

''A History of Card Games'', OUP, Oxford, p. 78. {{ISBN|0-19-282905-X}}</ref> It is a comparing [[card game]] between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more [[Playing card|decks]] of 52 cards, and is the most widely played [[casino game|casino]] banking game in the world.<ref name=\"Scarne\">{{cite book |last1=Scarne |first1=John |title=Scarne's new complete guide to gambling |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0671630638 |edition=Fully rev., expanded , updated|year=1986 }}</ref>{{rp|342}} \n\nPlayers are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"soft\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is called \"hard\".\n\nOnce all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n\n* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"blackjack\" or \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"busts\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n* If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"busts\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"push\", no one wins.\n\nBlackjack has over 100 rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of [[Advantage gambling|advantage players]], particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly. In response, casinos have introduced counter-measures that can increase the difficulty of advantage play.\n\nBlackjack has inspired other casino games, including [[Spanish 21]] and [[Pontoon (card game)|pontoon]].\n\n==History==\nBlackjack's precursor was ''twenty-one'', a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale \"[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]\", from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheats working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''veintiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the [[ace]] values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish ''[[Spanish playing cards|baraja]]'' deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en Espa\u00f1a.

One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the [[ace of spades]] and a black [[jack (playing card)|jack]] (either the [[jack of clubs]] or the [[jack of spades]]). This hand was called a \"blackjack\", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a ''blackjack'' refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.<ref name=\"Scarne\" />{{rp|350}}\n\nThe first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956.  Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled ''The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack'' in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  This paper would become the foundation of future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. [[Ed Thorp]] would use Baldwin's hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book ''Beat the Dealer''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackjack History and Events|url=https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/historical-events/|publisher=blackjackreview.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rules of play at casinos==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Blackjack example game\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align =\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Blackjack game 1.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | caption1  = Initial deal\n | image2    = Blackjack game 2.JPG\n | width2    = 250\n | caption2  = Player action\n | image3    = Blackjack game 3.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n | caption3  = Dealer's hand revealed\n | image4    = Blackjack game 4.JPG\n | width4    = 250\n | caption4  = Bets settled\n }}\nAt a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight [[standard 52-card deck]]s are [[shuffling|shuffled]] together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the \"betting box\" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to \"play behind\". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.\n\nThe dealer deals cards from their left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as \"first base\") to their far right (\"third base\"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in \"hole card\" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, \"no hole card\" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.\n\nCards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).\n\nThe object of the game from the player's perspective is to win money by creating card totals that are higher than those of the dealer's hand, but do not exceed 21 (\"busting\"/\"breaking\"), or alternatively, by \"standing\" (not taking a card) at any total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players must choose whether to \"hit\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn), \"double\" (double wager, take a single card and finish), \"split\" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or \"surrender\" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as \"face cards\" or \"pictures\") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a \"soft 17\", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a \"natural\" or \"blackjack\" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as \"push\" or \"standoff\",  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.<ref name=LVSun20031113/>\n\nBlackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as \"Dealer Match\" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.\n\n===Player decisions===\n{{anchor|doubledown}}\n{{redirect|Doubling Down|the South Park episode|Doubling Down (South Park)}}\nAfter receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, \"surrender\".\n* '''Hit:''' Take another card from the dealer.\n: ''Signal'': Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Stand:''' Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\".\n: ''Signal'': Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Double down:''' The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n* '''Split''': If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.\n* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to \"surrender\" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.\n: ''Signal'': The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.\n\nHand signals are used to assist the \"[[eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]\", a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.\nEach hand may normally \"hit\" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in [[counterclockwise]] order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.\n\n===Insurance===\nIf the dealer's up card (the card that is showing) is an ace, you are allowed to make an \u201cinsurance\u201d bet. This is a side bet that the dealer has a ten-value card as the down card, giving the dealer a Blackjack. The dealer will ask for insurance bets from all players before the first player plays. You make this bet by placing chips equal to a maximum of half of your current bet on the \u201cinsurance bar\u201d just above your cards. If the dealer has a ten, the insurance bet pays 2:1. In most casinos, the dealer then peeks at the down card and pays or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.\n\nIn face-down games, if you are playing more than one hand, you are allowed to look at all of your hands before deciding. This is the only time that you are allowed to look at the second hand before playing the first hand. Using one hand, look at your hands one at a time.\n\nPlayers with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they will win an amount equal to their main wager. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as \"taking even money\". There is no difference in results between taking even money and insuring a blackjack.\n\nInsurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have a blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance]], they might choose to make this bet.\n\nThe insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a one in three chance of being a ten. Card counting techniques can identify such situations.\n\n==Rule variations and effects on house edge==\n''Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in [[percentage point]]s, not percentage. That is, if an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%: it is reduced by one percentage point, not reduced by ten percent.''\n[[File:Double down.JPG|thumb|right|Doubling down. The third card is placed at right angles to signify that the player cannot receive any more cards.]]\nThe rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rule variations of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table. You can ask the dealer if the variations are not clearly posted. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm|title=Blackjack Rules - 113 variations|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\nAs with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a \"house edge\", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. This house edge is primarily due to the fact that the player will lose when both the player and dealer bust. However, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with average luck, which is a substantially lower house edge than most other casino games. This is not true in games where blackjack pays 6:5 as that rule increases the house edge by about 1.4%. The expected loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through poor play will be greater, often much greater.\n\n*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''\n[[File:Soft17.jpg|thumb|right|A \"soft 17\" in blackjack. An ace and any combination of 6.]]\n:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated \"H17\" in blackjack literature, with \"S17\" used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an \"H17\" rule with an \"S17\" rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.\n\n*'''Number of decks'''\n:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.\n\n:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.\n\n:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number of decks !! House advantage\n|-\n| Single deck || 0.17%\n|-\n| Double deck || 0.46%\n|-\n| Four decks || 0.60%\n|-\n| Six decks || 0.64%\n|-\n| Eight decks || 0.66%\n|}\n\n;Late/early surrender:\n\nSurrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as \"late\" surrender. The alternative, \"early\" surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender.\n\nFor late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.\n\n;Resplitting: If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or \"resplit\". The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, \"resplit to 4\").\n;Hit/resplit split aces: After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a \"soft 21\" and not a \"natural\".\n;No double after split: After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.\n;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: Under the \"[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule\", double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13\u201318, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19\u201320 and hard 8, 7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around 1 in 1,000, and its European version by around 1 in 500.\n;No hole card and OBO:\n\nIn most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of aces against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.\n\nThe \"original bets only\" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (\"original\") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. \"Original bets only\" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm|title=Modern Blackjack|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\n;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower [[Table limit|table minimums]]. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge.

Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in \"blackjack-like\" games such as in some charity casinos.\n\n==Blackjack strategy==\n\n===Basic strategy===\nEach blackjack game has a ''basic strategy'', which prescribes the optimal method of playing any hand against any dealer up-card so that the long-term [[house advantage]] (the expected loss of the player) is minimized.\n\nAn example of a basic strategy is shown in the table below, which applies to a game with the following specifications:<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\">{{cite web|title=4-Deck to 8-Deck Blackjack Strategy - Wizard of Odds|url=http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/|publisher=Wizard of Odds Consulting, Inc|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n* Four to eight decks\n* The dealer hits on a soft 17\n* A double is allowed after a split\n* Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For example, to use the table above on a game with the stand on soft 17 rule (which favors the player, and is typically found only at higher-limit tables today) only 6 cells would need to be changed: hit on 11 ''vs.'' A, hit on 15 ''vs.'' A, stand on 17 ''vs.'' A, stand on A,7 ''vs.'' 2, stand on A,8 ''vs.'' 6, and split on 8,8 ''vs.'' A. Regardless of the specific rule variations, taking insurance or \"even money\" is never the correct play under basic strategy.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/>\n\nEstimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.\n\nMost blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games from the perspective of the player. Casino promotions such as complimentary match play vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.\n\n===Composition-dependent strategy===\nBasic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:<ref name= wizard>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n* It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).\n* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.\n\nHowever, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.<ref name= wizard2>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Advantage play===\n{{Main|Advantage player}}\nBlackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:\n\n====Card counting====\n{{Main|Card counting}}\n\nDuring the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:\n* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.\n* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.\n\nA card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2\u20136, 0 points for 7\u20139 and \u22121 point for 10\u2013A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for \"balanced\" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.\n\nBlackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%\u20131% when players use basic strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table|title=Blackjack - Beating Bonuses|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref> Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.<ref name=\"TOB\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Peter |title=The theory of blackjack : the compleat card counter's guide to the casino game of 21 |date=March 1, 1999 |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=978-0929712130 |edition=6th}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nCard counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly advantageous to the card counting player. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.\n\nCard counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device,<ref name=\"TOB\" />{{rp|6\u20137}} but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.<ref>[[Edward O. Thorp|Thorp, Edward O.]] (1966) ''Beat The Dealer'', Vintage Books, a Division of Random House, {{ISBN|978-0-394-70310-7}}, pp 132\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|title=State Gambling Laws|website=www.gambling-law-us.com|access-date=October 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151916/http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Shuffle tracking====\n{{main|Shuffle tracking}}\nTechniques other than card counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by [[Edward O. Thorp]].<ref>Edward Thorp: ''A Favorable Strategy for Twenty-One'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 47, No. 1, 1961, pp. 110\u2013112, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/70615 JSTOR], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC285252/pdf/pnas00217-0125.pdf archive of PNAS].</ref> One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm|title=Blackjack in Color|work=Shuffle Tracking Counts}}</ref>\n\nArnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.<ref>''The Gambling Times Guide to Blackjack''; Gambling Times Incorporated, Hollywood, CA;  1984; Page 110; {{ISBN|0-89746-015-4}} Shuffle-Tracking An Easy Way to Start</ref><ref>''Break the Dealer''; by Jerry L. Patterson and Eddie Olsen; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam;  1986; {{ISBN|0-399-51233-0}} Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 6, Page 83</ref><ref>''Blackjack: A Winner's Handbook''; by Jerry L. Patterson; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; \u00a9 1990; {{ISBN|0-399-51598-4}}  Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 4, Page 51</ref>\n\n====Identifying concealed cards====\nThe player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by [[hole carding]] (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.\n\n==Side bets==\nMany blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Odds|work=Blackjack Side Bets|url=http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html}}</ref>\n*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (\"Lucky Lucky\")\n*Player initial hand is a pair (\"Perfect pairs\")\n*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (\"Royal match\")\n*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (\"21+3\")\n*Player initial hand totals 20 (\"Lucky Ladies\")\n*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (\"In Bet\")\n*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (\"Bust It!\")\n*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (\"Match the Dealer\")\n\nThe side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.\n\nThe house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Only a few side bets, like \"Lucky Ladies\", offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.\n\nIn team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.\n\n==Blackjack tournaments==\nBlackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, [[Elimination Blackjack]], drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.\n\n==Video blackjack==\n[[Image:Video Blackjack Machine at Seven Feathers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A video Blackjack machine at [[Seven Feathers Casino Resort|Seven Feathers Casino]].]]\nSome casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games generally deal each round from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting ineffective in most situations.\n\n==Variants of the game==\nBlackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.\n\n*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to ''rescue'', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6\u20137\u20138 21s, 7\u20137\u20137 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name [[Pontoon (card game)|\"Pontoon\"]] (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game \"Pontoon\" which has substantially different rules).\n*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as \"Vegas Style\" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.\n*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's cards are exposed at the outset).\n*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.\n*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10\u20136 and 5\u201310, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10\u201310 and 6\u20135.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.\n*'''[[Super Fun 21]]''' allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, he automatically wins. Wins are paid 1:1.\n\nExamples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''French/German Blackjack''', called ''Vingt-et-un'' (French: Twenty-one) or \"Siebzehn und Vier\" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called \"Pontoon\", the name being probably a corruption of \"Vingt-et-un\".\n\n===TV show variations===\nBlackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.\n\n*'''''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''''' was a game show with [[Wink Martindale]] where couples answer questions to collect cards that could add up to 21.\n*'''''[[Catch 21]]''''' is a [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] from ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. On this show, three players answer questions to earn cards in order to win cash and ties are not allowed.\n*From 1980 to 2006, there was a blackjack-based [[List of The Price is Right pricing games|pricing game]] on ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', called '''Hit Me'''. In this game, six grocery products were used, and five of those products' prices were multiplied by various numbers from 2 to 10, but with the one remaining product having the exact price. In order to win a large prize, the contestant had to achieve a score of 21 (which was usually done by picking a product whose price was multiplied by ten and the one that was correctly priced), or beat the house with any score that did not exceed 21.\n\n==Blackjack Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}\n\nIn 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the \"Wonging\" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.\n\n== Blackjack in the arts ==\nNovels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were ''The Blackjack Hijack'' (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie [[Nowhere to Run (1978 film)|''Nowhere to Run'']], and [[Bringing Down the House (book)|''Bringing Down the House'']] (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as [[21 (2008 film)|''21'']]. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film ''[[The Last Casino]]''.\n\nIn ''The Hangover'', an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of ''[[Rain Man]]'' is that Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an autistic [[savant syndrome|savant]], is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film ''[[The Gambler (2014 film)|The Gambler]]'' we see Jim Bennett ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Gambler (film series)]]\n* [[Glossary of blackjack terms]]\n* [[MIT Blackjack Team]]\n\n==Blackjack literature==\n* ''Beat the Dealer : A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'', [[Edward O.

''A History of Card Games'', OUP, Oxford, p. 78. {{ISBN|0-19-282905-X}}</ref> It is a comparing [[card game]] between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more [[Playing card|decks]] of 52 cards, and is the most widely played [[casino game|casino]] banking game in the world.<ref name=\"Scarne\">{{cite book |last1=Scarne |first1=John |title=Scarne's new complete guide to gambling |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0671630638 |edition=Fully rev., expanded , updated|year=1986 }}</ref>{{rp|342}} \n\nPlayers are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"soft\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is called \"hard\".\n\nOnce all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n\n* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"blackjack\" or \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"busts\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n* If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"busts\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"push\", no one wins.\n\nBlackjack has over 100 rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of [[Advantage gambling|advantage players]], particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly. In response, casinos have introduced counter-measures that can increase the difficulty of advantage play.\n\nBlackjack has inspired other casino games, including [[Spanish 21]] and [[Pontoon (card game)|pontoon]].\n\n==History==\nBlackjack's precursor was ''twenty-one'', a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale \"[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]\", from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheats working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''veintiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the [[ace]] values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish ''[[Spanish playing cards|baraja]]'' deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en Espa\u00f1a.

One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the [[ace of spades]] and a black [[jack (playing card)|jack]] (either the [[jack of clubs]] or the [[jack of spades]]). This hand was called a \"blackjack\", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a ''blackjack'' refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.<ref name=\"Scarne\" />{{rp|350}}\n\nThe first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956.  Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled ''The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack'' in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  This paper would become the foundation of future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. [[Ed Thorp]] would use Baldwin's hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book ''Beat the Dealer''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackjack History and Events|url=https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/historical-events/|publisher=blackjackreview.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rules of play at casinos==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Blackjack example game\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align =\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Blackjack game 1.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | caption1  = Initial deal\n | image2    = Blackjack game 2.JPG\n | width2    = 250\n | caption2  = Player action\n | image3    = Blackjack game 3.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n | caption3  = Dealer's hand revealed\n | image4    = Blackjack game 4.JPG\n | width4    = 250\n | caption4  = Bets settled\n }}\nAt a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight [[standard 52-card deck]]s are [[shuffling|shuffled]] together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the \"betting box\" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to \"play behind\". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.\n\nThe dealer deals cards from their left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as \"first base\") to their far right (\"third base\"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in \"hole card\" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, \"no hole card\" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.\n\nCards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).\n\nThe object of the game from the player's perspective is to win money by creating card totals that are higher than those of the dealer's hand, but do not exceed 21 (\"busting\"/\"breaking\"), or alternatively, by \"standing\" (not taking a card) at any total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players must choose whether to \"hit\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn), \"double\" (double wager, take a single card and finish), \"split\" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or \"surrender\" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as \"face cards\" or \"pictures\") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a \"soft 17\", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a \"natural\" or \"blackjack\" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as \"push\" or \"standoff\",  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.<ref name=LVSun20031113/>\n\nBlackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as \"Dealer Match\" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.\n\n===Player decisions===\n{{anchor|doubledown}}\n{{redirect|Doubling Down|the South Park episode|Doubling Down (South Park)}}\nAfter receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, \"surrender\".\n* '''Hit:''' Take another card from the dealer.\n: ''Signal'': Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Stand:''' Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\".\n: ''Signal'': Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Double down:''' The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n* '''Split''': If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.\n* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to \"surrender\" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.\n: ''Signal'': The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.\n\nHand signals are used to assist the \"[[eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]\", a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.\nEach hand may normally \"hit\" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in [[counterclockwise]] order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.\n\n===Insurance===\nIf the dealer's up card (the card that is showing) is an ace, you are allowed to make an \u201cinsurance\u201d bet. This is a side bet that the dealer has a ten-value card as the down card, giving the dealer a Blackjack. The dealer will ask for insurance bets from all players before the first player plays. You make this bet by placing chips equal to a maximum of half of your current bet on the \u201cinsurance bar\u201d just above your cards. If the dealer has a ten, the insurance bet pays 2:1. In most casinos, the dealer then peeks at the down card and pays or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.\n\nIn face-down games, if you are playing more than one hand, you are allowed to look at all of your hands before deciding. This is the only time that you are allowed to look at the second hand before playing the first hand. Using one hand, look at your hands one at a time.\n\nPlayers with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they will win an amount equal to their main wager. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as \"taking even money\". There is no difference in results between taking even money and insuring a blackjack.\n\nInsurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have a blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance]], they might choose to make this bet.\n\nThe insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a one in three chance of being a ten. Card counting techniques can identify such situations.\n\n==Rule variations and effects on house edge==\n''Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in [[percentage point]]s, not percentage. That is, if an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%: it is reduced by one percentage point, not reduced by ten percent.''\n[[File:Double down.JPG|thumb|right|Doubling down. The third card is placed at right angles to signify that the player cannot receive any more cards.]]\nThe rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rule variations of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table. You can ask the dealer if the variations are not clearly posted. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm|title=Blackjack Rules - 113 variations|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\nAs with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a \"house edge\", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. This house edge is primarily due to the fact that the player will lose when both the player and dealer bust. However, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with average luck, which is a substantially lower house edge than most other casino games. This is not true in games where blackjack pays 6:5 as that rule increases the house edge by about 1.4%. The expected loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through poor play will be greater, often much greater.\n\n*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''\n[[File:Soft17.jpg|thumb|right|A \"soft 17\" in blackjack. An ace and any combination of 6.]]\n:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated \"H17\" in blackjack literature, with \"S17\" used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an \"H17\" rule with an \"S17\" rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.\n\n*'''Number of decks'''\n:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.\n\n:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.\n\n:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number of decks !! House advantage\n|-\n| Single deck || 0.17%\n|-\n| Double deck || 0.46%\n|-\n| Four decks || 0.60%\n|-\n| Six decks || 0.64%\n|-\n| Eight decks || 0.66%\n|}\n\n;Late/early surrender:\n\nSurrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as \"late\" surrender. The alternative, \"early\" surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender.\n\nFor late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.\n\n;Resplitting: If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or \"resplit\". The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, \"resplit to 4\").\n;Hit/resplit split aces: After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a \"soft 21\" and not a \"natural\".\n;No double after split: After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.\n;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: Under the \"[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule\", double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13\u201318, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19\u201320 and hard 8, 7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around 1 in 1,000, and its European version by around 1 in 500.\n;No hole card and OBO:\n\nIn most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of aces against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.\n\nThe \"original bets only\" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (\"original\") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. \"Original bets only\" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm|title=Modern Blackjack|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\n;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower [[Table limit|table minimums]]. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack.<ref name=LVSun20031113>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/taking-a-hit-new-blackjack-odds-further-tilt-advan/ ''Taking a hit: New blackjack odds further tilt advantage toward the house''] by Jeff Haney, [[Las Vegas Sun]], November 13, 2003.</ref>\n;Dealer wins ties: The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player.  Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in \"blackjack-like\" games such as in some charity casinos.\n\n==Blackjack strategy==\n\n===Basic strategy===\nEach blackjack game has a ''basic strategy'', which prescribes the optimal method of playing any hand against any dealer up-card so that the long-term [[house advantage]] (the expected loss of the player) is minimized.\n\nAn example of a basic strategy is shown in the table below, which applies to a game with the following specifications:<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\">{{cite web|title=4-Deck to 8-Deck Blackjack Strategy - Wizard of Odds|url=http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/|publisher=Wizard of Odds Consulting, Inc|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n* Four to eight decks\n* The dealer hits on a soft 17\n* A double is allowed after a split\n* Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For example, to use the table above on a game with the stand on soft 17 rule (which favors the player, and is typically found only at higher-limit tables today) only 6 cells would need to be changed: hit on 11 ''vs.'' A, hit on 15 ''vs.'' A, stand on 17 ''vs.'' A, stand on A,7 ''vs.'' 2, stand on A,8 ''vs.'' 6, and split on 8,8 ''vs.'' A. Regardless of the specific rule variations, taking insurance or \"even money\" is never the correct play under basic strategy.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/>\n\nEstimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.\n\nMost blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games from the perspective of the player. Casino promotions such as complimentary match play vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.\n\n===Composition-dependent strategy===\nBasic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:<ref name= wizard>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n* It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).\n* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.\n\nHowever, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.<ref name= wizard2>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Advantage play===\n{{Main|Advantage player}}\nBlackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:\n\n====Card counting====\n{{Main|Card counting}}\n\nDuring the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:\n* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.\n* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.\n\nA card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2\u20136, 0 points for 7\u20139 and \u22121 point for 10\u2013A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for \"balanced\" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.\n\nBlackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%\u20131% when players use basic strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table|title=Blackjack - Beating Bonuses|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref> Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.<ref name=\"TOB\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Peter |title=The theory of blackjack : the compleat card counter's guide to the casino game of 21 |date=March 1, 1999 |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=978-0929712130 |edition=6th}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nCard counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly advantageous to the card counting player. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.\n\nCard counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device,<ref name=\"TOB\" />{{rp|6\u20137}} but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.<ref>[[Edward O.

All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by [[Edward O. Thorp]].<ref>Edward Thorp: ''A Favorable Strategy for Twenty-One'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 47, No. 1, 1961, pp. 110\u2013112, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/70615 JSTOR], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC285252/pdf/pnas00217-0125.pdf archive of PNAS].</ref> One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm|title=Blackjack in Color|work=Shuffle Tracking Counts}}</ref>\n\nArnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.<ref>''The Gambling Times Guide to Blackjack''; Gambling Times Incorporated, Hollywood, CA;  1984; Page 110; {{ISBN|0-89746-015-4}} Shuffle-Tracking An Easy Way to Start</ref><ref>''Break the Dealer''; by Jerry L.

Patterson; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; \u00a9 1990; {{ISBN|0-399-51598-4}}  Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 4, Page 51</ref>\n\n====Identifying concealed cards====\nThe player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by [[hole carding]] (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.\n\n==Side bets==\nMany blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Odds|work=Blackjack Side Bets|url=http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html}}</ref>\n*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (\"Lucky Lucky\")\n*Player initial hand is a pair (\"Perfect pairs\")\n*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (\"Royal match\")\n*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (\"21+3\")\n*Player initial hand totals 20 (\"Lucky Ladies\")\n*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (\"In Bet\")\n*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (\"Bust It!\")\n*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (\"Match the Dealer\")\n\nThe side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.\n\nThe house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Only a few side bets, like \"Lucky Ladies\", offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.\n\nIn team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.\n\n==Blackjack tournaments==\nBlackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, [[Elimination Blackjack]], drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.\n\n==Video blackjack==\n[[Image:Video Blackjack Machine at Seven Feathers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A video Blackjack machine at [[Seven Feathers Casino Resort|Seven Feathers Casino]].]]\nSome casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games generally deal each round from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting ineffective in most situations.\n\n==Variants of the game==\nBlackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.\n\n*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to ''rescue'', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6\u20137\u20138 21s, 7\u20137\u20137 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name [[Pontoon (card game)|\"Pontoon\"]] (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game \"Pontoon\" which has substantially different rules).\n*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as \"Vegas Style\" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.\n*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's cards are exposed at the outset).\n*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.\n*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10\u20136 and 5\u201310, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10\u201310 and 6\u20135.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.\n*'''[[Super Fun 21]]''' allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, he automatically wins. Wins are paid 1:1.\n\nExamples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''French/German Blackjack''', called ''Vingt-et-un'' (French: Twenty-one) or \"Siebzehn und Vier\" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called \"Pontoon\", the name being probably a corruption of \"Vingt-et-un\".\n\n===TV show variations===\nBlackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.\n\n*'''''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''''' was a game show with [[Wink Martindale]] where couples answer questions to collect cards that could add up to 21.\n*'''''[[Catch 21]]''''' is a [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] from ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. On this show, three players answer questions to earn cards in order to win cash and ties are not allowed.\n*From 1980 to 2006, there was a blackjack-based [[List of The Price is Right pricing games|pricing game]] on ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', called '''Hit Me'''. In this game, six grocery products were used, and five of those products' prices were multiplied by various numbers from 2 to 10, but with the one remaining product having the exact price. In order to win a large prize, the contestant had to achieve a score of 21 (which was usually done by picking a product whose price was multiplied by ten and the one that was correctly priced), or beat the house with any score that did not exceed 21.\n\n==Blackjack Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}\n\nIn 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the \"Wonging\" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.\n\n== Blackjack in the arts ==\nNovels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were ''The Blackjack Hijack'' (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie [[Nowhere to Run (1978 film)|''Nowhere to Run'']], and [[Bringing Down the House (book)|''Bringing Down the House'']] (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as [[21 (2008 film)|''21'']]. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film ''[[The Last Casino]]''.\n\nIn ''The Hangover'', an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of ''[[Rain Man]]'' is that Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an autistic [[savant syndrome|savant]], is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film ''[[The Gambler (2014 film)|The Gambler]]'' we see Jim Bennett ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Gambler (film series)]]\n* [[Glossary of blackjack terms]]\n* [[MIT Blackjack Team]]\n\n==Blackjack literature==\n* ''Beat the Dealer : A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'', [[Edward O.
