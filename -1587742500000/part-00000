Dismayed at Cartman's views of NASCAR, Kenny, and himself, Stan and Kyle effectively convince him that he's actually very poor and very stupid. Cartman immediately turns to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] for help in becoming as poor and stupid as possible: he gives Butters all his money and orders him to spend it all and never give it back. Then, while watching what he hopes is brain-cell-killing TV programming, he sees a commercial for [[Combe Incorporated|Vagisil]] that lists [[Anterograde amnesia|short-term memory loss]] as a possible side effect, so he shoplifts some and consumes it (quite literally, as he eats the cream meant for topical use). On race day, Butters convinces a driver to abandon his car because his wife has been raped, and Cartman hops into his car, but his total lack of knowledge causes an accident that lands him in the hospital. The doctor comments to Cartman, who's disappointed that he is not more seriously injured than he is, that his accident was the stupidest he has ever seen, which restores Cartman's hope. His antics cause the news media to wonder if all NASCAR fans are as stupid as he seems to be. This infuriates Kenny, and begins to take serious matters into his own hands.\n\nKenny, incensed and furious, storms to Cartman's house just in time for a visit from Vagisil founder Geoff Hamill and his wife Patty. Since Cartman's determination has brought considerable attention to Vagisil, Hamill rewards him with his own Vagisil-sponsored racecar, further galling Kenny. Before his first race, Cartman posts bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast and the media concludes that \"NASCAR really is just for the poor and stupid\". Kenny decides that he must put a stop to Cartman. He tries to smuggle a hunting rifle into the racetrack, but it gets confiscated. He is however reassured that he can buy another in the gift shop.\n\nAt Cartman's first race in his Vagisil car, he drives badly, crashing into other drivers, pulling [[Danica Patrick]] under the wheel, and mowing down spectators. When Kenny tries to interrupt, he's knocked onto the track; 2 cars crash to avoid him, leaving Cartman's the only car remaining in the race. Suddenly, Patty Hamill, fed up of her husband's disrespectful and condescending remarks toward her, gets onto the track and takes [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s damaged car. She beats Cartman and wins the race, much to Hamill's sheer disappointment, now that his company is ruined. Cartman apologizes to Kenny (who, surprisingly is still alive) for trying to become a NASCAR driver, and gives his future up, still believing that he is too smart for NASCAR. He demands that Butters give back his money, then yells at him for having done what he was told and gotten rid of it. Kenny watches in disbelief and confusion.\n\n== Production and theme  {{anchor|Production|ThemeCultural references}} ==\n[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] wrote and directed \"Poor and Stupid\"|alt=A brown-haired man wearing a lime shirt and grown jacket smiles and looks at something off-screen.]]\n\"Poor and Stupid\" was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated TV-MA LV in the United States.

A curator cuts his finger on the crystal teeth of a carved stone head called an \"Aztec Bloodstone\" and is soon possessed by it. Later noticing a steady trickle of blood coming from the Bloodstone, on instinct Pete removes it from display. Myka dramatically thwarts the zombie-like curator's knife attack of the President (actually an attack on the Mexican Ambassador's daughter, as the \"Bloodstone\" craves virgin sacrifices) as Pete is confronted by a man who knows his name and disappears with the Bloodstone in a flash of light. Pete is temporarily suspended pending investigation into his strange story, but later visited by the mysterious Mrs. Frederick ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]), who orders him to report to particular coordinates for an extended special assignment. Arriving at an isolated government warehouse in [[South Dakota]], Pete finds a flummoxed Myka close behind him. They are welcomed to Warehouse 13 by Artie Nielsen  ([[Saul Rubinek]]), the man who had taken the Bloodstone. Artie explains that they will be joining him as \"gatherers and protectors of secrets\"\u2014specifically, empowered and potentially dangerous objects both stored in the warehouse and located out in the world and in need of retrieval. Pete is somewhat intrigued by what Artie calls \"America's attic,\" while Myka feels she is \"too valuable to be wasted\" at such a task.\n\nWhile Myka and Pete's former boss Daniel Dickenson (Simon Reynolds) is trying to figure out how to get them back, Artie sends the agents to investigate a report of domestic abuse in Seever City, [[Iowa]] which he believes may be connected to an item. The agents meet [[University of Southern Iowa]] law student Cody Thomas, being held for assaulting his girlfriend; during questioning, Cody begins speaking [[15th century Italian]] and flies into a rage. The Renaissance professor who translates his words is driven to suicide, and Cody's godmother and lawyer Lorna Solliday ([[Sherry Miller]]) reveals Cody's girlfriend Emily as the reason. Myka and Pete see a [[jeweled]] [[comb]] on Lorna, who suddenly tries to kill them. An unconscious Myka sees a vision of her deceased lover Sam Martino ([[Gabriel Hogan]]) before she awakens. Artie determines that the comb had once been owned by Italian [[Scam|schemer]] [[Lucretia Borgia]], and possesses \"twisted desires\" which will drive everyone around it to violence. Myka and Pete manage to stop Lorna and retrieve the comb. After meeting Mrs. Frederick, Dickenson gives Myka a choice: she can stay in South Dakota or return to Washington, but Pete must stay at Warehouse 13 either way. Myka stays.\n\n==Artifacts==\n* Aztec Bloodstone - used in human sacrifices. The museum worker affected by the Bloodstone took a ceremonial Aztec knife and attacked the daughter of the Mexican Ambassador, who he was somehow able to identify as a virgin.\n* Tesla - a polyphase electrical stun gun invented by [[Nikola Tesla]]. Standard issue weapon for Warehouse Agents, seen in multiple episodes. The power on the Tesla has settings from 1 to 5 in half-point increments; Artie suggests not using it above 2.\n* Farnsworth - a two-way video communication system invented by [[Philo Farnsworth]]. It's fairly flat, with several knobs to select communication frequencies and a round black and white screen. In a later episode, Artie mentions that they have their own frequency which cannot be hacked. Standard issue for Warehouse Agents, seen in multiple episodes.\n* American [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|football]] - when thrown, it apparently circles the earth and returns to the place it was thrown. Seen in multiple episodes. Its artifact nature is explained in the season 4 premiere, [[Warehouse 13 (season 4)|\"A New Hope\"]].\n* Wand - unknown effect. Artie uses it to \"fix the fish.\"\n* [[Thomas Edison]]'s Bio-Electric Vehicle - created as a prototype for [[Henry Ford]], but he chose to forego the electric car in favor of the [[internal combustion engine]]. If two people hold onto the bar on the front of the vehicle, the electricity from their bodies powers the car.\n* [[Harry Houdini]]'s Wallet - Possesses the power of \"charonic transfer,\" allowing the bearer to see and hear visions of dead people. Causes Myka to see her deceased partner, Sam Martino. According to the tag on the shelf, the wallet was obtained three days after Houdini's death.\n* [[Tea kettle]] - The kettle can apparently move itself around unnoticed; it sneaks into Pete's hand while Artie is explaining the function of the Warehouse. The kettle grants wishes, but if someone makes a wish that cannot be granted, the kettle produces a ferret instead; nobody knows why it does this.\n* [[Mayan Calendar]] - Artie states that two Warehouse Agents had their \"clocks stopped\" with this artifact, implying that they're still alive, but wish they won't be in a hundred years. Not shown but mentioned.\n* [[Lucrezia Borgia]]'s comb - transmits the mindset of the famous Italian murderess through the crystals in the comb. It also gives the bearer the ability to control the actions of others, using an Italian phrase as a phonetic trigger.\n* [[Pandora's Box]] - Artie briefly mentions that Pandora's box is kept (empty) in Aisle 989-B of Warehouse 13.<ref>http://www.tv.com/shows/warehouse-13/pilot-1230936/</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\"Pilot\" marked the first series debut after SyFy changed its name from The Sci Fi Channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/ny-ettel0512918136jun29,0,6980221.story |title=Sci Fi channel changes its name to Syfy |last=Werts |first=Diane |date=June 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>  \"Pilot\" was produced by Universal Cable Productions.

A curator cuts his finger on the crystal teeth of a carved stone head called an \"Aztec Bloodstone\" and is soon possessed by it. Later noticing a steady trickle of blood coming from the Bloodstone, on instinct Pete removes it from display. Myka dramatically thwarts the zombie-like curator's knife attack of the President (actually an attack on the Mexican Ambassador's daughter, as the \"Bloodstone\" craves virgin sacrifices) as Pete is confronted by a man who knows his name and disappears with the Bloodstone in a flash of light. Pete is temporarily suspended pending investigation into his strange story, but later visited by the mysterious Mrs. Frederick ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]), who orders him to report to particular coordinates for an extended special assignment. Arriving at an isolated government warehouse in [[South Dakota]], Pete finds a flummoxed Myka close behind him. They are welcomed to Warehouse 13 by Artie Nielsen  ([[Saul Rubinek]]), the man who had taken the Bloodstone. Artie explains that they will be joining him as \"gatherers and protectors of secrets\"\u2014specifically, empowered and potentially dangerous objects both stored in the warehouse and located out in the world and in need of retrieval. Pete is somewhat intrigued by what Artie calls \"America's attic,\" while Myka feels she is \"too valuable to be wasted\" at such a task.\n\nWhile Myka and Pete's former boss Daniel Dickenson (Simon Reynolds) is trying to figure out how to get them back, Artie sends the agents to investigate a report of domestic abuse in Seever City, [[Iowa]] which he believes may be connected to an item. The agents meet [[University of Southern Iowa]] law student Cody Thomas, being held for assaulting his girlfriend; during questioning, Cody begins speaking [[15th century Italian]] and flies into a rage. The Renaissance professor who translates his words is driven to suicide, and Cody's godmother and lawyer Lorna Solliday ([[Sherry Miller]]) reveals Cody's girlfriend Emily as the reason. Myka and Pete see a [[jeweled]] [[comb]] on Lorna, who suddenly tries to kill them. An unconscious Myka sees a vision of her deceased lover Sam Martino ([[Gabriel Hogan]]) before she awakens. Artie determines that the comb had once been owned by Italian [[Scam|schemer]] [[Lucretia Borgia]], and possesses \"twisted desires\" which will drive everyone around it to violence. Myka and Pete manage to stop Lorna and retrieve the comb. After meeting Mrs. Frederick, Dickenson gives Myka a choice: she can stay in South Dakota or return to Washington, but Pete must stay at Warehouse 13 either way. Myka stays.\n\n==Artifacts==\n* Aztec Bloodstone - used in human sacrifices. The museum worker affected by the Bloodstone took a ceremonial Aztec knife and attacked the daughter of the Mexican Ambassador, who he was somehow able to identify as a virgin.\n* Tesla - a polyphase electrical stun gun invented by [[Nikola Tesla]]. Standard issue weapon for Warehouse Agents, seen in multiple episodes. The power on the Tesla has settings from 1 to 5 in half-point increments; Artie suggests not using it above 2.\n* Farnsworth - a two-way video communication system invented by [[Philo Farnsworth]]. It's fairly flat, with several knobs to select communication frequencies and a round black and white screen. In a later episode, Artie mentions that they have their own frequency which cannot be hacked. Standard issue for Warehouse Agents, seen in multiple episodes.\n* American [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|football]] - when thrown, it apparently circles the earth and returns to the place it was thrown. Seen in multiple episodes. Its artifact nature is explained in the season 4 premiere, [[Warehouse 13 (season 4)|\"A New Hope\"]].\n* Wand - unknown effect. Artie uses it to \"fix the fish.\"\n* [[Thomas Edison]]'s Bio-Electric Vehicle - created as a prototype for [[Henry Ford]], but he chose to forego the electric car in favor of the [[internal combustion engine]]. If two people hold onto the bar on the front of the vehicle, the electricity from their bodies powers the car.\n* [[Harry Houdini]]'s Wallet - Possesses the power of \"charonic transfer,\" allowing the bearer to see and hear visions of dead people.

Then in 1941, the famous Yuen Kay Shan owner of great properties in that state and winner of a thousand death fights/combats, asked Cheung's permission to teach Sam some more techniques since he discovered he had talent. But Sam looking at the master\u2019s slim and low physique, doubted his talent and responded that he had nothing to learn from him. Then, Yuen Kay Shan said because it was his passion, demonstrated and gave him a slight beating so Sam was convinced that he could learn a lot from him and was now his disciple. Sum Nung developed a great reputation toward the quality of his Kung Fu, he often had to fight to defend himself against the discrimination for being a foreigner. In 1943 he began teaching in Foshan in the village's deep temple to students like Sum Jee. In the late 1940s, he moved to the city of Guangzhou, where he taught Wing Chun to members of several local trade unions. In 1947, he was a professor of Wing Chun in the Guangzhou union machinery. The following year, he opened a natural (herbal) or traditional medicine clinic and was a Chinese doctor at Daisun Street and also ran a martial arts school.<ref name=\"LATNung\" /><ref name=\"Complete Wing Chun\" /><ref name=\"Ren\u00e9 Ritchie\" />\n\n==Philosophy==\nHobby and Philosophy\nSam's hobby was bird fighting and he said he would not feed birds that were not good at fighting, a philosophy that influenced the choice of his students such as [[Felix Leong]], whom Sum received Felix as a student because he was already a master of Wing Chun under master Lai Chi Wa and he won the title of Australian National Martial arts champion in 1977, the following year he fought in New Zealand and ended up as champion of South Pacific.<ref name=\"LATNung\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 2016 film ''[[Ip Man 3]]'' martial arts film directed by [[Wilson Yip]], and produced by [[Raymond Wong Pak-ming]], which was the third in the series of films based on the life of [[Ip Man]], Grandmaster of Wing Chun, with [[Donnie Yen]] in the lead role, also featuring [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Bruce Lee]], one of Ip's students, played by [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]].\n\nThe actor [[Max Zhang Jin|Zhang Jin]] was cast in the supposed role of Sum Nung, who was also an expert in Wing Chun and an able opponent of Ip Man in complex battles.<ref name=\"Moviefreak\">{{cite news |last1=Michelle |first1=Sara |title=Heartfelt Ip Man 3 a Triumph for Donnie Yen |url=http://moviefreak.com/ip-man-3-2016-movie-review/#.W_lULOgzaCh |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=moviefreak |issue=Online |publisher=MovieFreak.com |date=22 January 2016 |ref=Moviefreak}}</ref><ref name=\"Ip Man 3 Blackbelt\">{{cite news|url=https://blackbeltmag.com/arts/history-philosophy/donnie-yen-is-back-and-ready-to-portray-the-wing-chun-legend-in-ip-man-3|title=DONNIE YEN IS BACK AND READY TO PORTRAY THE WING CHUN LEGEND IN IP MAN 3|last=|first=|date=2015|work=[[Black Belt Magazine]]|accessdate=24 November 2018|publisher=Black Belt Magazine 1000 LLC|issue=Online|ref=Ip Man 3 Blackbelt}}</ref><ref name=\"Dramasian\">{{cite news |last1=B |first1=Lee |title=Donnie Yen Experiences Mike Tyson's Fists in \"Ip Man 3\" |url=https://www.dramasian.com/threads/donnie-yen-experiences-mike-tysons-fists-in-ip-man-3.87464/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=Dramasian |issue=Online |publisher=Damasian |date=14 November 2015 |ref=Dramasian}}</ref> However, due to Sum Nung being a disciple of [[Yuen Kay Shan]], the name Sum Nung was changed to Cheung Tin-chi to avoid conflicts with Yuen Kay Shan's lineage and descendants, which was previously erupted in a controversy of Yuen Kay Shan being misrepresented in the 2010 film ''[[The Legend Is Born: Ip Man]]'' back then.\n\n==Legacy==\nNowadays, many Wing Chun practitioners in Guangzhou are his descendants.

Then in 1941, the famous Yuen Kay Shan owner of great properties in that state and winner of a thousand death fights/combats, asked Cheung's permission to teach Sam some more techniques since he discovered he had talent. But Sam looking at the master\u2019s slim and low physique, doubted his talent and responded that he had nothing to learn from him. Then, Yuen Kay Shan said because it was his passion, demonstrated and gave him a slight beating so Sam was convinced that he could learn a lot from him and was now his disciple. Sum Nung developed a great reputation toward the quality of his Kung Fu, he often had to fight to defend himself against the discrimination for being a foreigner. In 1943 he began teaching in Foshan in the village's deep temple to students like Sum Jee. In the late 1940s, he moved to the city of Guangzhou, where he taught Wing Chun to members of several local trade unions. In 1947, he was a professor of Wing Chun in the Guangzhou union machinery. The following year, he opened a natural (herbal) or traditional medicine clinic and was a Chinese doctor at Daisun Street and also ran a martial arts school.<ref name=\"LATNung\" /><ref name=\"Complete Wing Chun\" /><ref name=\"Ren\u00e9 Ritchie\" />\n\n==Philosophy==\nHobby and Philosophy\nSam's hobby was bird fighting and he said he would not feed birds that were not good at fighting, a philosophy that influenced the choice of his students such as [[Felix Leong]], whom Sum received Felix as a student because he was already a master of Wing Chun under master Lai Chi Wa and he won the title of Australian National Martial arts champion in 1977, the following year he fought in New Zealand and ended up as champion of South Pacific.<ref name=\"LATNung\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 2016 film ''[[Ip Man 3]]'' martial arts film directed by [[Wilson Yip]], and produced by [[Raymond Wong Pak-ming]], which was the third in the series of films based on the life of [[Ip Man]], Grandmaster of Wing Chun, with [[Donnie Yen]] in the lead role, also featuring [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Bruce Lee]], one of Ip's students, played by [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]].\n\nThe actor [[Zhang Jin]] was cast in the supposed role of Sum Nung, who was also an expert in Wing Chun and an able opponent of Ip Man in complex battles.<ref name=\"Moviefreak\">{{cite news |last1=Michelle |first1=Sara |title=Heartfelt Ip Man 3 a Triumph for Donnie Yen |url=http://moviefreak.com/ip-man-3-2016-movie-review/#.W_lULOgzaCh |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=moviefreak |issue=Online |publisher=MovieFreak.com |date=22 January 2016 |ref=Moviefreak}}</ref><ref name=\"Ip Man 3 Blackbelt\">{{cite news|url=https://blackbeltmag.com/arts/history-philosophy/donnie-yen-is-back-and-ready-to-portray-the-wing-chun-legend-in-ip-man-3|title=DONNIE YEN IS BACK AND READY TO PORTRAY THE WING CHUN LEGEND IN IP MAN 3|last=|first=|date=2015|work=[[Black Belt Magazine]]|accessdate=24 November 2018|publisher=Black Belt Magazine 1000 LLC|issue=Online|ref=Ip Man 3 Blackbelt}}</ref><ref name=\"Dramasian\">{{cite news |last1=B |first1=Lee |title=Donnie Yen Experiences Mike Tyson's Fists in \"Ip Man 3\" |url=https://www.dramasian.com/threads/donnie-yen-experiences-mike-tysons-fists-in-ip-man-3.87464/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=Dramasian |issue=Online |publisher=Damasian |date=14 November 2015 |ref=Dramasian}}</ref> However, due to Sum Nung being a disciple of [[Yuen Kay Shan]], the name Sum Nung was changed to Cheung Tin-chi to avoid conflicts with Yuen Kay Shan's lineage and descendants, which was previously erupted in a controversy of Yuen Kay Shan being misrepresented in the 2010 film ''[[The Legend Is Born: Ip Man]]'' back then.\n\n==Legacy==\nNowadays, many Wing Chun practitioners in Guangzhou are his descendants.

The episode's teleplay was written by [[Scott Peters (writer)|Scott Peters]], with story credit going to Johnson and Peters. [[Yves Simoneau]] directed the episode, which originally aired in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 3, 2009. The episode sees spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities. Though the alien \"[[Visitors (V TV series)|Visitors]]\" claim to come in peace, it transpires that they have been infiltrating the planet for decades, and are planning on enslaving the human species.\n\nParallels have been drawn between the Visitors and US Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]], though Peters and co-producer [[Jeffrey Jackson Bell|Jeffrey Bell]] refute that they were intentional. Bell feels that while the original series was more of a military show with a clear enemy, the reimagining focuses more on the paranoia of not knowing who can be trusted. The episode incorporates aspects of the original series, including the Visitors' giant spaceships, but is quick to reveal the Visitors' true motivations, as Peters felt awareness of the original story was already high.\n\nThe episode was watched by 14.3 million US viewers, and received generally positive reviews. ''[[USA Today]]''{{'s}} Robert Bianco praised it for \"quickly establishing its own identity\" independent of the original series, while [[E! Online]] named it the best pilot episode in \"forever\". In contrast, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'s}} Mike Hale called the episode \"slapdash and formulaic\", while David Hinckley of the ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' deemed it \"an elaborately costumed popcorn flick\".\n\n==Plot==\nWhen spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities, the alien \"Visitors\" claim to come in peace. Their leader Anna ([[Morena Baccarin]]) offers to trade technology and cures for many diseases with mankind, in return for water and minerals. She invites TV journalist Chad Decker ([[Scott Wolf]]) to interview her, on the condition he only portray the Visitors in a positive light.\n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] counterterrorism agent Erica Evans ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) disapproves that her teenage son Tyler ([[Logan Huffman]]) is so enamoured by the aliens, being recruited for the V Peace Ambassador Program by the beautiful Visitor Lisa ([[Laura Vandervoort]]). Erica and her partner Dale Maddox ([[Alan Tudyk]]) investigate a group of terrorists whose activity spiked during the Visitors' initial appearance. They discover an abandoned hideout containing explosives, fake IDs and a deceased man who was tortured prior to his death. His cellphone contains details of a sleeper cell meeting, which Erica attends.\n\nElsewhere, [[Catholic]] priest Jack Landry ([[Joel Gretsch]]) is suspicious of the Visitors, and warns his parishioners to be wary of them. He doubts his stance when a previously wheelchair-bound parishioner is able to walk again, but has his suspicions confirmed when a mortally wounded man arrives at the church, telling Jack he knows the real reason behind the Visitors' appearance on Earth, handing him a dossier on the aliens and details of a secret meeting.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Nichols ([[Morris Chestnut]]) is contacted repeatedly throughout the day by his old acquaintance Georgie (David Richmond-Peck), but refuses to go along with what Georgie wants from him, as he is planning on asking his girlfriend Valerie ([[Lourdes Benedicto]]) to marry him. It transpires that Georgie is running the meeting which both Erica and Jack attend. He demands that all new attendants have an incision made in their skin to prove they are human, as the Visitors are actually reptiles with cloned human flesh hiding their reptilian appearance. He claims that the Visitors have been infiltrating Earth for years, and have installed agents in high positions of society with the ultimate intention of enslaving the human species. Jack shows Georgie the dossier, which contains photographs of the visitors in disguise, one of whom Erica recognizes from the fake passports seized during the earlier raid.\n\nThe group are suddenly attacked by a group of human-disguised Visitors, including Erica's partner Dale. She is able to overpower him, while Ryan arrives and defends Georgie. They escape from the building, and Ryan reveals that he is actually a Visitor, but opposes their plans. He returns home with the intention of breaking up with his girlfriend to protect her, but in his absence she has discovered the engagement ring he purchased for her. Erica and Jack discuss beginning a resistance movement against the Visitors.\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries ''V'' created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC.<ref name=\"ABCMN 2009-05\">{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/DNR/2009/abc_20092010_schedule.pdf |title=ABC Unveils 2009-2010 Primetime Schedule |publisher=ABC Medianet |last=McPherson |first=Stephen |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611203141/http://abcmedianet.com/DNR/2009/abc_20092010_schedule.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref> Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a167318/elizabeth-mitchell-talks-lost-v.html|title= Elizabeth Mitchell talks ''Lost'', ''V''|last=French|first=Dan|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref> Executive producer [[Scott Peters (writer)|Scott Peters]] later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including \"the huge ships [and] the red uniforms\" seen in the pilot, as: \"we are well aware of those moments and looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience.\"<ref name=\"SFW 2009-08-11\">{{cite web |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/08/v-producer-on-who-might-r.php |title=''V'' producer on who might return and other homages |first=Patrick |last=Lee |publisher=SciFiWire.com |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917171228/http://scifiwire.com/2009/08/v-producer-on-who-might-r.php |archive-date=September 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: \"We tried to put our own [spin on it]. We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood.\"<ref name=\"SFW 2009-08-11\"/>\n\nThe Visitors' spaceship was entirely computer generated, and all scenes which took place aboard it were filmed in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]].<ref name=\"CO\"/> The internal design of the Visitor ship appears to be based on [[Santiago Calatrava|Santiago Calatrava's]] [[Futurist architecture|futurist]] style of architecture as the hallways appear to be based on the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] hallways and the white L'Hemisf\u00e8ric building from the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies|City of the Arts and the Sciences]] in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] can be seen in the middle of the Visitor city, both of which were designed by Calatrava. Calatrava's designs have made their way into numerous science-fiction productions such as the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' movies and the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]] worlds in the movie ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.\n\nPeters, who wrote the pilot episode with his mentor [[Sam Egan]],<ref name=\"CO\"/> felt that it was important to reveal the Visitors' secret quickly, as: \"There is this huge awareness of the original. The story is already known and out there, so we want to leap forward quickly, so we don't build and build and build to something people already know.\"<ref name=\"CH\"/> Co-producer Jeffrey Bell, commenting on differences between the original and reimagining, stated:\n\n{{cquote|This is quite different. The original series, to me, felt very much like a military show. It was about a resistance and gunfights. There was a clear and present enemy. They wore uniforms. It was the [[Cold War]]; it was the [[Nazis]]; it was whoever. Post [[9/11]], that's not who our enemy is anymore. There is no single threat. It's terrorists; it's the guy across the street or the woman next door. Who do you trust? We have humans who are traitors; we have Visitors who have a nefarious agenda; we have Visitors who are heroes.

Bush|Bush administrations]] have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that the theme of the show is \"blind devotion\", with no political or religious agenda.<ref name=\"ES\"/> Peters commented: \"Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're on one side of the political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and you can look at that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation.\"<ref name=\"CH\"/> Bell added: \"We're talking about metaphors and allegories here.

Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: \"Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus that a lot of these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world.\"<ref name=\"ES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/28/11556926.html|title=Something old and borrowed forms a V |last=Harris|first=Bill|date=October 28, 2009|work=[[Edmonton Sun]]|accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: \"I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it.

The episode's teleplay was written by [[Scott Peters (writer)|Scott Peters]], with story credit going to Johnson and Peters. [[Yves Simoneau]] directed the episode, which originally aired in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 3, 2009. The episode sees spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities. Though the alien \"[[Visitors (V TV series)|Visitors]]\" claim to come in peace, it transpires that they have been infiltrating the planet for decades, and are planning on enslaving the human species.\n\nParallels have been drawn between the Visitors and US Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]], though Peters and co-producer [[Jeffrey Jackson Bell|Jeffrey Bell]] refute that they were intentional. Bell feels that while the original series was more of a military show with a clear enemy, the reimagining focuses more on the paranoia of not knowing who can be trusted. The episode incorporates aspects of the original series, including the Visitors' giant spaceships, but is quick to reveal the Visitors' true motivations, as Peters felt awareness of the original story was already high.\n\nThe episode was watched by 14.3 million US viewers, and received generally positive reviews. ''[[USA Today]]''{{'s}} Robert Bianco praised it for \"quickly establishing its own identity\" independent of the original series, while [[E! Online]] named it the best pilot episode in \"forever\". In contrast, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'s}} Mike Hale called the episode \"slapdash and formulaic\", while David Hinckley of the ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' deemed it \"an elaborately costumed popcorn flick\".\n\n==Plot==\nWhen spaceships appear over 29 of the world's major cities, the alien \"Visitors\" claim to come in peace. Their leader Anna ([[Morena Baccarin]]) offers to trade technology and cures for many diseases with mankind, in return for water and minerals. She invites TV journalist Chad Decker ([[Scott Wolf]]) to interview her, on the condition he only portray the Visitors in a positive light.\n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] counterterrorism agent Erica Evans ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) disapproves that her teenage son Tyler ([[Logan Huffman]]) is so enamoured by the aliens, being recruited for the V Peace Ambassador Program by the beautiful Visitor Lisa ([[Laura Vandervoort]]). Erica and her partner Dale Maddox ([[Alan Tudyk]]) investigate a group of terrorists whose activity spiked during the Visitors' initial appearance. They discover an abandoned hideout containing explosives, fake IDs and a deceased man who was tortured prior to his death. His cellphone contains details of a sleeper cell meeting, which Erica attends.\n\nElsewhere, [[Catholic]] priest Jack Landry ([[Joel Gretsch]]) is suspicious of the Visitors, and warns his parishioners to be wary of them. He doubts his stance when a previously wheelchair-bound parishioner is able to walk again, but has his suspicions confirmed when a mortally wounded man arrives at the church, telling Jack he knows the real reason behind the Visitors' appearance on Earth, handing him a dossier on the aliens and details of a secret meeting.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Nichols ([[Morris Chestnut]]) is contacted repeatedly throughout the day by his old acquaintance Georgie (David Richmond-Peck), but refuses to go along with what Georgie wants from him, as he is planning on asking his girlfriend Valerie ([[Lourdes Benedicto]]) to marry him. It transpires that Georgie is running the meeting which both Erica and Jack attend. He demands that all new attendants have an incision made in their skin to prove they are human, as the Visitors are actually reptiles with cloned human flesh hiding their reptilian appearance. He claims that the Visitors have been infiltrating Earth for years, and have installed agents in high positions of society with the ultimate intention of enslaving the human species. Jack shows Georgie the dossier, which contains photographs of the visitors in disguise, one of whom Erica recognizes from the fake passports seized during the earlier raid.\n\nThe group are suddenly attacked by a group of human-disguised Visitors, including Erica's partner Dale. She is able to overpower him, while Ryan arrives and defends Georgie. They escape from the building, and Ryan reveals that he is actually a Visitor, but opposes their plans. He returns home with the intention of breaking up with his girlfriend to protect her, but in his absence she has discovered the engagement ring he purchased for her. Erica and Jack discuss beginning a resistance movement against the Visitors.\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2009 that a reimagining of the 1983 miniseries ''V'' created by Kenneth Johnson, had been picked up by ABC.<ref name=\"ABCMN 2009-05\">{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/DNR/2009/abc_20092010_schedule.pdf |title=ABC Unveils 2009-2010 Primetime Schedule |publisher=ABC Medianet |last=McPherson |first=Stephen |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611203141/http://abcmedianet.com/DNR/2009/abc_20092010_schedule.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref> Cast member Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a167318/elizabeth-mitchell-talks-lost-v.html|title= Elizabeth Mitchell talks ''Lost'', ''V''|last=French|first=Dan|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref> Executive producer [[Scott Peters (writer)|Scott Peters]] later confirmed that the new series would incorporate memorable elements of the original, including \"the huge ships [and] the red uniforms\" seen in the pilot, as: \"we are well aware of those moments and looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience.\"<ref name=\"SFW 2009-08-11\">{{cite web |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/08/v-producer-on-who-might-r.php |title=''V'' producer on who might return and other homages |first=Patrick |last=Lee |publisher=SciFiWire.com |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917171228/http://scifiwire.com/2009/08/v-producer-on-who-might-r.php |archive-date=September 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: \"We tried to put our own [spin on it]. We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood.\"<ref name=\"SFW 2009-08-11\"/>\n\nThe Visitors' spaceship was entirely computer generated, and all scenes which took place aboard it were filmed in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]].<ref name=\"CO\"/> The internal design of the Visitor ship appears to be based on [[Santiago Calatrava|Santiago Calatrava's]] [[Futurist architecture|futurist]] style of architecture as the hallways appear to be based on the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] hallways and the white L'Hemisf\u00e8ric building from the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies|City of the Arts and the Sciences]] in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] can be seen in the middle of the Visitor city, both of which were designed by Calatrava. Calatrava's designs have made their way into numerous science-fiction productions such as the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' movies and the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]] worlds in the movie ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.\n\nPeters, who wrote the pilot episode with his mentor [[Sam Egan]],<ref name=\"CO\"/> felt that it was important to reveal the Visitors' secret quickly, as: \"There is this huge awareness of the original. The story is already known and out there, so we want to leap forward quickly, so we don't build and build and build to something people already know.\"<ref name=\"CH\"/> Co-producer Jeffrey Bell, commenting on differences between the original and reimagining, stated:\n\n{{cquote|This is quite different.

Bush|Bush administrations]] have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that the theme of the show is \"blind devotion\", with no political or religious agenda.<ref name=\"ES\"/> Peters commented: \"Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're on one side of the political spectrum or the other.

Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: \"Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus that a lot of these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way.

{"title_page": "Voting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Vote}}\n{{Redirect|Voter}}\n\n{{Voting images}}\n\n'''Voting''' is a method for a group, such as a meeting or legal cheating by the electorate, to get votes or express an opinion usually following stupid and gay cults, Like [[Trump Pence|TrumpPence]]. \n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.

B-voters again, split exactly in half. Each B-voter decides to vote negatively against their least favorite candidate, with the reasoning that this negative vote allows them to express approval for the two other candidates.  C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens.

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest.

The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote.

This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present.

[[Democracy|Democracies]] elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called \"constituents\", and those constituents who cast a [[ballot]] for their chosen candidate are called \"voters\".  There are different systems for collecting votes.\n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand.\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.  B-voters, unconfident of their candidate's chances, split their votes exactly in half, giving both Candidates A and C 15% each.  C-voters, also logically vote for their candidate.  A is the winner with 55%, C at 45% and B 0%.\n\n'''Election results with negative voting:'''\n\nA-voters again, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A. B-voters again, split exactly in half. Each B-voter decides to vote negatively against their least favorite candidate, with the reasoning that this negative vote allows them to express approval for the two other candidates.  C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]\" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

May\u2013June 2016.  10 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Meetings and gatherings==\nWhenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.<ref name=BBC/> If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016</ref>\n\nA similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present. This could be by a show of hands or [[keypad polling]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Cosmopolitan democracy]]\n*[[Democratic mundialization]]\n*[[Dollar voting]]\n*[[Electoral fraud]]\n*[[Electoral system]]\n*[[Gerrymandering]]\n*[[Mandate (politics)]]\n*[[Ranked voting systems]]\n*[[Opinion poll]]\n*[[Presidential election]]\n*[[Proportional representation]]\n*[[Psephology]]\n*[[Redistricting]]\n*[[Referendum]]\n*[[Suffrage]]\n*[[Voter turnout]]\n*[[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies]]\n*[[Voting system]]\n*[[Right of expatriates to vote in their country of origin]]\n*[[Vote Splitting]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|vote|voting}}\n{{Commons category|Voting}}\n*[http://americanhistory.si.edu/vote/ A history of voting in the United States] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n*[http://dca.tufts.edu/features/aas A New Nation Votes: American Elections Returns 1787-1825]\n*[http://www.canivote.org/ Can I Vote?]\u2014a nonpartisan US resource for registering to vote and finding your polling place from the [http://www.nass.org/ National Association of Secretaries of State].\n* [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/elections/el_000_e.shtml The Canadian Museum of Civilization \u2014 A History of the Vote in Canada ]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Vote|volume=28|pages=216\u2013217}} This contains a brief history of voting in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]; see also [[Electoral system#History|Electoral system s.v.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 17, 2009. In the episode, a psychic reads [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s palms and discovers he led a fascinating past life as Griffin Peterson, a dignified gentleman in [[Early modern Britain#17th century|17th-century England]], who was the original founder of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]].\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and directed by Brian Iles. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.33 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[John Ross Bowie]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Brody Hutzler]], Derwin Jordan, [[Keri Lynn Pratt]], [[David Pressman (actor)|David Pressman]], [[Josh Radnor]], [[Martin Savage (actor)|Martin Savage]], [[Jason Segel]], [[Alexander Siddig]] and [[Erik von Detten]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. This episode marks [[Cleveland Brown]]'s final regular appearance on ''Family Guy'' until the episode \"[[He's Bla-ack!]]\" in season 12 where he made his official return to the show.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] introduces his [[Jamaica]]n cousin Madame Claude to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] saying she is a [[psychic]]. Cleveland offers to have her [[Palmistry|read their palms]] and determine [[reincarnation|past lives]] they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an [[octopus]] whose tentacles were bitten off by a [[shark]], and Quagmire was [[Jack the Ripper]]. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows the story of this past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular ''Family Guy'' characters.\n\nIn [[Early modern Britain#17th century|17th-century England]], Griffin Peterson proposes to the love of his life Lady Redbush ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]) upon getting the approval from Carter Redbush. The ruthless King Stewart III ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) has the court [[jester]] ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]) tell him some jokes after \"deleting\" ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' from his \"[[TiVo]]\" (represented as archers killing [[Josh Radnor]], [[Jason Segel]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]]). While being carried around in his [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]], King Stewart spots Lady Redbush strolling through town with Griffin Peterson and decides that she should marry him instead. While Griffin Peterson is on the way to his wedding, Stewart secretly kidnaps him, [[exile|exil]]ing him to the [[Americas|New World]] on one of the outgoing ships. As Lady Redbush waits in growing angst, King Stewart walks into the church. He tells Lady Redbush that Griffin Peterson is dead and proceed to marry her himself.\n\nAt sea, Griffin Peterson meets fellow exiles Joe (exiled for pleasuring himself in front of a carving), Quagmire (exiled for having sex with an underage girl), and Seamus. Upon reaching the New World, Griffin Peterson establishes the colony of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]], which eventually grows into a thriving settlement. Griffin Peterson moves on with his life, even marrying another woman ([[Meg Griffin|Meg]]).\n\nBack in London, Later Redbush suffers a dull [[sexless marriage]] with King Stewart since they're never available to each other. Lady Redbush continues to lament Griffin's supposed death until the [[jester]] reveals the truth by showing her the newspaper about Quahog's founding. The jester stated that he was to keep quiet about this under threat of execution. Lady Redbush and the jester immediately depart for Quahog on one of the slave ships. In Quahog, Griffin Peterson has grown irritated with his current wife until Lady Redbush arrives. Griffin Peterson and Lady Rebush are reunited and Griffin \"divorces\" his current wife by killing her with a [[blunderbuss]].\n\nSix months later, King Stewart learns that Redbush is gone and he makes his way to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''). King Stewart orders [[Cockney]] [[First lieutenant#United Kingdom|First Lieutenant]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) to search every house for them. Upon being discovered by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a [[talent show]], with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]''. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.\n\nAfter the story is told, Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe, and Madame Claude see a promo ad for ''Cross-Armed Opposites''.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:John Viener by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|155px|Writer John Viener provided the voice of Madame Claude in this episode.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and directed by [[Brian Iles]].

He tells Lady Redbush that Griffin Peterson is dead and proceed to marry her himself.\n\nAt sea, Griffin Peterson meets fellow exiles Joe (exiled for pleasuring himself in front of a carving), Quagmire (exiled for having sex with an underage girl), and Seamus. Upon reaching the New World, Griffin Peterson establishes the colony of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]], which eventually grows into a thriving settlement. Griffin Peterson moves on with his life, even marrying another woman ([[Meg Griffin|Meg]]).\n\nBack in London, Later Redbush suffers a dull [[sexless marriage]] with King Stewart since they're never available to each other. Lady Redbush continues to lament Griffin's supposed death until the [[jester]] reveals the truth by showing her the newspaper about Quahog's founding. The jester stated that he was to keep quiet about this under threat of execution. Lady Redbush and the jester immediately depart for Quahog on one of the slave ships. In Quahog, Griffin Peterson has grown irritated with his current wife until Lady Redbush arrives. Griffin Peterson and Lady Rebush are reunited and Griffin \"divorces\" his current wife by killing her with a [[blunderbuss]].\n\nSix months later, King Stewart learns that Redbush is gone and he makes his way to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''). King Stewart orders [[Cockney]] [[First lieutenant#United Kingdom|First Lieutenant]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) to search every house for them. Upon being discovered by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a [[talent show]], with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]''. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.\n\nAfter the story is told, Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe, and Madame Claude see a promo ad for ''Cross-Armed Opposites''.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:John Viener by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|155px|Writer John Viener provided the voice of Madame Claude in this episode.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and directed by [[Brian Iles]].
