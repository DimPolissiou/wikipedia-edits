They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

Two were in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], where the entire province was redistricted from four districts to six, and one each in [[Cavite]], where the sixth and seventh districts were redistricted into three, [[Aklan]] and [[Southern Leyte]], which were split into two districts, [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], where [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] was separated from the second district and [[South Cotabato]], where [[General Santos City]] was separated from the first district.\n\nAs there are now 245 districts; therefore, there are 61 party-list seats (at least 20% of the total), an increase from 59. The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to rescheduled elections, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the unified Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election. This left the number of districts to 243, with still 61 party-list seats.\n\n==Retiring and term-limited incumbents==\n===Term limited===\nThese representatives are term-limited, and are thus not allowed to run in 2019:\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n*Ang Asosasyon Sang Mangunguma Nga Bisaya Owa Mangunguma incumbents\n**Sharon Garin (party-list)\n**:Garin denied that either she or her siblings were running for [[Governor of Iloilo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard\u2019s sis not running for guv|url=https://www.panaynews.net/richards-sis-not-running-for-guv/|work=Panay News|date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Advocacy for Teacher Empowerment through Action, Cooperation, and Harmony Towards Educational Reforms, Inc. incumbents\n**Julieta Cortuna (party-list)\n\n*Alliance of Concerned Teachers incumbents\n**Antonio Tinio (party-list)\n\n*Ako Bikol incumbents\n**Rodel Batocabe\u2020 (party-list)\n***Decided to run for [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]] mayor, killed in an assassination.\n**Christopher Co (party-list)\n\n*Buhay Hayaan Yumabong incumbents\n**Mariano Michael Velarde Jr. (party-list)\n\n*Citizens' Battle Against Corruption incumbents\n**[[Sherwin Tugna]] (party-list)\n\n*Democratic Independent Workers Association incumbents\n**Emmeline Aglipay-Villar (party-list)\n\n*Gabriela Women's Party incumbents\n**Emmi de Jesus (party-list)\n\n*Kalinga: Advocacy for Social Empowerment and Nation Building through Easing Poverty incumbents\n**Abigail Faye Ferriol-Pascual (party-list)\n\n*Kusug Tausug incumbents\n**Shernee Tan (party-list)\n\n*Liberal Party incumbents\n**[[Kaka Bag-ao]] (Dinagat Islands)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Dinagat Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LIST: Local bets who filed COCs on Day 4, October 16|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2019/214467-list-local-bets-who-filed-certificates-candidacy-october-16-2018|accessdate=October 30, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**[[Teddy Baguilat]] (Ifugao)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Ifugao]]\n**Jorge Banal (Quezon City\u20133rd)\n**Leopoldo Bataoil (Pangasinan\u20132nd)\n**[[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.]] (Quezon City\u20134th)\n**:Belmonte will retire from politics after his term ends in 2019, according to his daughter, [[Quezon City]] Vice Mayor [[Joy Belmonte]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sonny Belmonte will stick with LP, says daughter Joy|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/169561-sonny-belmonte-staying-liberal-party|accessdate=May 5, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**Imelda Calixto-Rubiano (Pasay)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Pasay]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n**Jose Carlos Cari (Leyte\u20135th)\n**Winnie Castelo (Quezon City\u20132nd)\n**:Running for Councilor of the 2nd District of [[Quezon City]] under Serbisyo sa Bayan Party.\n**Ronald Cosalan (Benguet)\n**[[Raul Daza]] (Northern Samar\u20131st)\n**Rogelio Espina (Biliran)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Biliran]]\n**Ana Cristina Go (Isabela\u20132nd)\n**[[Miro Quimbo]] (Marikina\u20132nd)\n**:Quimbo will run for Mayor of [[Marikina City]], later, he decided not to run.\n**Carlo Lopez (Manila\u20132nd)\n**[[Rene Relampagos]] (Bohol\u20131st)\n**:Running for Vice Governor of [[Bohol]] under the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]].\n**Linabelle Ruth Villarica (Bulacan\u20134th)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Meycauayan, Bulacan]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n\n*LPG Marketers Association incumbents\n**Arnel Ty (party-list)\n\n*Nacionalista Party incumbents\n**Florencio Flores Jr. (Bukidnon\u20132nd)\n**Seth Frederick Jalosjos (Zamboanga del Norte\u20131st)\n**[[Imelda Marcos]] (Ilocos Norte\u20132nd) \n**:running for Governor of Ilocos Norte, later withdrew\n\n*Nationalist People's Coalition incumbents\n**Pedro Acharon Jr. (South Cotabato\u20131st)\n**[[Mercedes Alvarez (politician)|Mercedes Alvarez]] (Negros Occidental\u20136th)\n**:In 2017, Alvarez said she plans to retire from politics after finishing her term.

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

Other parties are generally supportive of Duterte's policies.\n\n==District changes==\n[[Apportionment (politics)|Reapportioning]] the number of seats is done via national reapportionment after the release of every census or via piecemeal redistricting for every province or city. National reapportionment has not happened since the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] took effect, and aside from piecemeal redistricting, the apportionment was based on the ordinance from the constitution, which was in turn based from the 1980 census.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%;\"\n|+ House Bills (HB)<ref>{{cite web|title=HOUSE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=congress.gov.ph|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> and Senate Bills<ref>{{cite web|title=SENATE BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS|url=http://senate.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=bills|publisher=senate.gov.ph|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> (SB) related to redistricing bills\n|-\n!Bill No. !!

Two were in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], where the entire province was redistricted from four districts to six, and one each in [[Cavite]], where the sixth and seventh districts were redistricted into three, [[Aklan]] and [[Southern Leyte]], which were split into two districts, [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], where [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] was separated from the second district and [[South Cotabato]], where [[General Santos City]] was separated from the first district.\n\nAs there are now 245 districts; therefore, there are 61 party-list seats (at least 20% of the total), an increase from 59. The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to rescheduled elections, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the unified Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election. This left the number of districts to 243, with still 61 party-list seats.\n\n==Retiring and term-limited incumbents==\n===Term limited===\nThese representatives are term-limited, and are thus not allowed to run in 2019:\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n*Ang Asosasyon Sang Mangunguma Nga Bisaya Owa Mangunguma incumbents\n**Sharon Garin (party-list)\n**:Garin denied that either she or her siblings were running for [[Governor of Iloilo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard\u2019s sis not running for guv|url=https://www.panaynews.net/richards-sis-not-running-for-guv/|work=Panay News|date=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Advocacy for Teacher Empowerment through Action, Cooperation, and Harmony Towards Educational Reforms, Inc. incumbents\n**Julieta Cortuna (party-list)\n\n*Alliance of Concerned Teachers incumbents\n**Antonio Tinio (party-list)\n\n*Ako Bikol incumbents\n**Rodel Batocabe\u2020 (party-list)\n***Decided to run for [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]] mayor, killed in an assassination.\n**Christopher Co (party-list)\n\n*Buhay Hayaan Yumabong incumbents\n**Mariano Michael Velarde Jr. (party-list)\n\n*Citizens' Battle Against Corruption incumbents\n**[[Sherwin Tugna]] (party-list)\n\n*Democratic Independent Workers Association incumbents\n**Emmeline Aglipay-Villar (party-list)\n\n*Gabriela Women's Party incumbents\n**Emmi de Jesus (party-list)\n\n*Kalinga: Advocacy for Social Empowerment and Nation Building through Easing Poverty incumbents\n**Abigail Faye Ferriol-Pascual (party-list)\n\n*Kusug Tausug incumbents\n**Shernee Tan (party-list)\n\n*Liberal Party incumbents\n**[[Kaka Bag-ao]] (Dinagat Islands)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Dinagat Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LIST: Local bets who filed COCs on Day 4, October 16|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2019/214467-list-local-bets-who-filed-certificates-candidacy-october-16-2018|accessdate=October 30, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**[[Teddy Baguilat]] (Ifugao)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Ifugao]]\n**Jorge Banal (Quezon City\u20133rd)\n**Leopoldo Bataoil (Pangasinan\u20132nd)\n**[[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.]] (Quezon City\u20134th)\n**:Belmonte will retire from politics after his term ends in 2019, according to his daughter, [[Quezon City]] Vice Mayor [[Joy Belmonte]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sonny Belmonte will stick with LP, says daughter Joy|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/169561-sonny-belmonte-staying-liberal-party|accessdate=May 5, 2018|work=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>\n**Imelda Calixto-Rubiano (Pasay)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Pasay]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n**Jose Carlos Cari (Leyte\u20135th)\n**Winnie Castelo (Quezon City\u20132nd)\n**:Running for Councilor of the 2nd District of [[Quezon City]] under Serbisyo sa Bayan Party.\n**Ronald Cosalan (Benguet)\n**[[Raul Daza]] (Northern Samar\u20131st)\n**Rogelio Espina (Biliran)\n**:Running for Governor of [[Biliran]]\n**Ana Cristina Go (Isabela\u20132nd)\n**[[Miro Quimbo]] (Marikina\u20132nd)\n**:Quimbo will run for Mayor of [[Marikina City]], later, he decided not to run.\n**Carlo Lopez (Manila\u20132nd)\n**[[Rene Relampagos]] (Bohol\u20131st)\n**:Running for Vice Governor of [[Bohol]] under the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]].\n**Linabelle Ruth Villarica (Bulacan\u20134th)\n**:Running for Mayor of [[Meycauayan, Bulacan]] under [[Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan|PDP-Laban]].\n\n*LPG Marketers Association incumbents\n**Arnel Ty (party-list)\n\n*Nacionalista Party incumbents\n**Florencio Flores Jr. (Bukidnon\u20132nd)\n**Seth Frederick Jalosjos (Zamboanga del Norte\u20131st)\n**[[Imelda Marcos]] (Ilocos Norte\u20132nd) \n**:running for Governor of Ilocos Norte, later withdrew\n\n*Nationalist People's Coalition incumbents\n**Pedro Acharon Jr. (South Cotabato\u20131st)\n**[[Mercedes Alvarez (politician)|Mercedes Alvarez]] (Negros Occidental\u20136th)\n**:In 2017, Alvarez said she plans to retire from politics after finishing her term.

There were no floors separating one level from another, only steel library stacks surrounded by catwalks. The tower was like an oven and the fire spread quickly. Extinguishing it was extremely difficult, with only one entrance and stairwell from the bottom and limited window access.\n\n[[Fire chief|Fire Chief]] Alfred Eckert dispatched masked [[firefighters]] to the highest floor that could be safely reached. The firefighters spread canvas tarpaulins over as many shelves of books as they could, while hook and ladder trucks sprayed water through the highest openings in the tower, cascading down to the fire below. The fire was declared under control at about 7:00 PM, nine hours after it was discovered.\n\nMenahem Schmelzer, the [[librarian]] at the time, joined Gerson Cohen, the future chancellor of the JTS, and the fire chief, for the initial foray into the damp, charred stacks. The fire had been confined primarily to the upper stacks, which housed mostly second and third copies of books, although some important recent acquisitions had also been kept there. But the water had caused enormous damage and the growth of mold threatened to do more.\n\nAfter rejecting several methods for drying the water-soaked books, the suggestion was brought to Rabbi David Kogen, then-vice chancellor of the Seminary,  to place paper towels between the pages of every book to absorb the moisture. Volunteers of all ages were recruited from around the neighborhood and [[Jewish day school]] students were brought in to help. The paper toweling was supplied by local retailers and manufacturers.\n\nSome 70,000 volumes were destroyed in the fire and many more were damaged.<ref name=\"lostmemoryunesco\">[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905105742/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=September 5, 2012 }})</ref> The library's rare books and [[manuscripts]], which were stored elsewhere, were spared.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Library/About.xml |title=The Jewish Theological Seminary - About The Library<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165131/http://www.jtsa.edu/Library/About.xml |archive-date=2008-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe library's book collection was rebuilt with the help of donations from private and institutional libraries. The books were moved to a prefabricated building in the JTS courtyard that remained until a new library building was completed in 1984.\n\nThe library now exceeds 380,000 volumes. With the assistance of the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, 35,000 books that were saved from the fire and placed in high-density storage are being restored and catalogued.\n\n==See also ==\n* [[List of destroyed libraries]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Conservative Judaism in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Jewish libraries]]\n[[Category:Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]\n[[Category:Libraries in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:School fires]]\n[[Category:Library fires]]\n[[Category:1966 in New York City]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox event\n| title                    = Jewish Theological Seminary library fire\n| image                    = \n| image_size               = \n| caption                  = \n| date                     = {{start date|1966|04|18}}\n| time                     = 10:15 AM\n| place                    = Broadway and 122nd Street in [[New York City]]\n| coordinates              = {{coord|40|48|42.8|N|73|57|38.3|W|region:US-NY_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| cause                    = \n}}\nThe '''Jewish Theological Seminary library fire''' was discovered on Monday, April 18, 1966, at 10:15 AM when smoke was seen pouring from one of the small upper windows of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] [[library]] tower at Broadway and 122nd Street in [[New York City]].\n\nThe tower, with only few small windows, was the perfect environment for a major conflagration.

But the water had caused enormous damage and the growth of mold threatened to do more.\n\nAfter rejecting several methods for drying the water-soaked books, the suggestion was brought to Rabbi David Kogen, then-vice chancellor of the Seminary,  to place paper towels between the pages of every book to absorb the moisture. Volunteers of all ages were recruited from around the neighborhood and [[Jewish day school]] students were brought in to help. The paper toweling was supplied by local retailers and manufacturers.\n\nSome 70,000 volumes were destroyed in the fire and many more were damaged.<ref name=\"lostmemoryunesco\">[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905105742/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=September 5, 2012 }})</ref> The library's rare books and [[manuscripts]], which were stored elsewhere, were spared.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Library/About.xml |title=The Jewish Theological Seminary - About The Library<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165131/http://www.jtsa.edu/Library/About.xml |archive-date=2008-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe library's book collection was rebuilt with the help of donations from private and institutional libraries. The books were moved to a prefabricated building in the JTS courtyard that remained until a new library building was completed in 1984.\n\nThe library now exceeds 380,000 volumes. With the assistance of the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, 35,000 books that were saved from the fire and placed in high-density storage are being restored and catalogued.\n\n==See also ==\n* [[List of destroyed libraries]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Conservative Judaism in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Jewish libraries]]\n[[Category:Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]\n[[Category:Libraries in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:School fires]]\n[[Category:Library fires]]\n[[Category:1966 in New York City]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Theological_Seminary_library_fire"}

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both sides of the Hill.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both sides of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nargis Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr. Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.\nOn the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu lives therein.\n\nDown towards Union Park & Golf Links at the North end of the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr. Narayan Rane.\nThe Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings overseeing the nets of The \"Danda' fishing Village.\n\nOther landmarks include Kangaroo Kids Nursery and Playschool, Juice Salon, Sundaram Stores, cozy home apartments.

The museum features original objects and memorabilia related to James Monroe, and includes items relating to other members of his family, including dresses worn by [[First Lady]] [[Elizabeth Monroe]].\n\n==Description and history==\nThe Monroe Museum is located in central Fredericksburg, on the west side of Charles Street, between William and George Streets.  It is housed in a two-part building that is roughly L-shaped.  The older portion is a long 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a gabled roof, built in 1758.  To this is attached a larger 1-1/2 story square brick building dating to 1964, when the museum and library were organized.  The addition houses Monroe memorabilia, and a small library containing volumes similar to those that might have been in Monroe's library.  The museum also houses a collection of furnishings and other artifacts belonging to the Monroes, although most date to the 19th century.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nThe outside includes a memorial garden to James Monroe, which features a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of him sculpted by [[Margaret French Cresson]], daughter of [[Daniel Chester French]].\n\nThis building, composed of three separate 19th century structures later joined together, occupies a site said by tradition to be the law office of future United States President [[James Monroe]] from 1786 to 1789. Monroe had prior to this time served in the Virginia House of Delegates and in the [[Congress of the Confederation]], from which he resigned in 1786.  In 1788 he was a delegate to the Virginia ratifying convention for the [[United States Constitution]].  He initially opposed adoption until a Bill of Rights could be added.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nMonroes's law office was acquired in 1928 by Laurence Hoes, a Monroe family descendant who established the Monroe Foundation to manage the property.

The museum features original objects and memorabilia related to James Monroe, and includes items relating to other members of his family, including dresses worn by [[First Lady]] [[Elizabeth Monroe]].\n\n==Description and history==\nThe Monroe Museum is located in central Fredericksburg, on the west side of Charles Street, between William and George Streets.  It is housed in a two-part building that is roughly L-shaped.  The older portion is a long 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a gabled roof, built in 1758.  To this is attached a larger 1-1/2 story square brick building dating to 1964, when the museum and library were organized.  The addition houses Monroe memorabilia, and a small library containing volumes similar to those that might have been in Monroe's library.  The museum also houses a collection of furnishings and other artifacts belonging to the Monroes, although most date to the 19th century.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nThe outside includes a memorial garden to James Monroe, which features a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of him sculpted by [[Margaret French Cresson]], daughter of [[Daniel Chester French]].\n\nThis building, composed of three separate 19th century structures later joined together, occupies a site said by tradition to be the law office of future United States President [[James Monroe]] from 1786 to 1789. Monroe had prior to this time served in the Virginia House of Delegates and in the [[Congress of the Confederation]], from which he resigned in 1786.  In 1788 he was a delegate to the Virginia ratifying convention for the [[United States Constitution]].  He initially opposed adoption until a Bill of Rights could be added.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nMonroes's law office was acquired in 1928 by Laurence Hoes, a Monroe family descendant who established the Monroe Foundation to manage the property. He accumulated a variety of artifacts related to his illustrious ancestor, restored the property, and opened it as a museum.  In 1964 the addition was built, and the Monroe Foundation gave the property to the state.  It is now managed by a board consisting of members of the Monroe Foundation and the regents of the [[University of Mary Washington]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline|James Monroe Law office}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110313062221/http://www.monroefoundation.org/history.html Monroe Foundation history]\n*[http://jamesmonroemuseum.umw.edu/ James Monroe Law Office Museum and Memorial Library] - University of Mary Washington website\n*[http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/monroe_law_office.html James Monroe Law Office Museum and Memorial Library] - Park Service website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726063506/http://www.fredbuildings.org/historic-buildings/james-monroe-law-office Photos]\n*[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122387-1/life-portrait-james-monroe \"Life Portrait of James Monroe\"], from [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[American Presidents: Life Portraits]]'', broadcast from the James Monroe Memorial Museum, April 12, 1999\n\n{{James Monroe|state=expanded}}\n{{NRHP in Fredericksburg, Virginia}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Virginia}}\n\n[[Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Museums in Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Presidential museums in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Libraries in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1786]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Presidential libraries|Monroe]]\n[[Category:James Monroe|Law Office]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia]]\n[[Category:University of Mary Washington]]\n[[Category:Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe_Law_Office"}
