A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]].

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.\n\nOvechkin has won the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]], awarded annually to the NHL's leading goal scorer, an NHL-record eight times. His first such title came in [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308]], when his 65 goals and 112 points also earned him the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for most points scored, the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] for most valuable player, and the [[Ted Lindsay Award|Lester B.

The name 'Vaigai Express' has been always popular among not only rail users but also among rail fans of two different generations as the train has won the hearts of thousands of people who have known and experienced it from the early days. Due to the demand for a day train between [[Madurai]] and [[Madras]], which gradually began to increase from the 1970s, the Southern Railway decided to introduce a super fast train for the first time on the MG in Southern railway. This train got updated with modern LHB coaches from 30 June 2019.\n\n== Background ==\nOn 15{{nbsp}}August 1977 at 6 am, Down Train No. 135 Vaigai Express began its inaugural journey from Madurai to [[Chennai Egmore|Madras Egmore]], with 16 yellow and green livery coaches and a matching YDM4 diesel loco. When it was introduced in 1977, this train had 16 coaches, hauled by twin-YDM4 diesel locos, and by 1984 it was bifurcated as the [[Pallavan Express]], comprising eight coaches.\nThe Vaigai express clocked the fastest run between Madurai and Madras Egmore over a distance of {{convert|497|km}} on the first day in 7 hours and 5 minutes when it entered [[Chennai Egmore|Madras Egmore]] at 1.05 p.m. that afternoon, matching the speed of many Broad Gauge super fast trains on the SR. For safety purposes the train, was slowed down to a journey time of 7 hours and 40 minutes later on. It was the only train in SR which had completely tube lighted interiors and sun control sliding glass shutters installed for the first time in all its eight-second class coaches. The driver and the guard also had a corded telephone system to communicate. With the turntable facility available at Trichy, Chennai and Madurai, the operations staff always ensured that the YDM4 hauling the Vaigai Express always had the short hood facing the front every time its started it journey.\n\nThis train also was one of its kind in SR which had its livery changed a number of times from its original yellow-green combination to white-gray-red livery and then again to vermillon red - cream livery and again to cream-brown livery on the MG. The YDM4 for the Vaigai Express had been fitted with a double-tone horn which made it easy for rail users and railway staff alike to identify the loco as well as the train, which was never on use on the other YDM4s which operated on the same route for other trains. This the only MG train on the SR to be fitted with specially enhanced buffers and certified to run at 110&nbsp;km/h. For the first time on the MG, the ICF manufactured two 40-seat AC chair car coaches exclusively for the Vaigai and Pallavan express. From 12{{nbsp}}February 2014, the Vaigai Express is being hauled by  electric locomotive WAP-4 from Arakkonam & Erode Loco Shed & WAP-7 from Royapuram Loco Shed from Madurai to Chennai Egmore.\n\n== Accident of Vaigai  Express ==\nAugust 1978 to January 1979  Vaigai Express was involved  in accidents twice.  On 21st  December 1978 it dashed against two boulders between Talanallur and Vriddhachalam Town stations and on 22 December 1978 it derailed at Tiruchirappalli station. <ref> https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2057/1/lsd_06_07_01-03-1979.pdf Page no. 98 </ref>\n\n== Rakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:orange;\"| Loco\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightpink;\"| 1\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 2\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 3\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 4\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 5\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 6\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 7\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 8\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 9\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 10\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 11\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:cyan;\" | 12\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 13\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 14\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 15\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 16\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 17\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 18\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 19\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 20\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 21\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\" | 22\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\" | 23\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightpink;\" | 24\n|-\n|[[File:BSicon LDER.svg|25px]]|| EOG || UR || C1 || C2 || C3 || D1 || D2 || D3 || D4 || D5 || D6 ||D7||PC|| D8|| D9 || D10 || D11 || D12 || D13 || UR || UR || EOG \n|}\n<br />\n\n==Enroute==\nTrain number 12636 leaves {{rws|Madurai Junction}} at 7:00 am and arrives at [[Tiruchirappalli Junction|Trichy Junction]] at 9:00 am before reaching {{rws|Chennai Egmore}} at 2:35 pm.

The name 'Vaigai Express' has been always popular among not only rail users but also among rail fans of two different generations as the train has won the hearts of thousands of people who have known and experienced it from the early days. Due to the demand for a day train between [[Madurai]] and [[Madras]], which gradually began to increase from the 1970s, the Southern Railway decided to introduce a super fast train for the first time on the MG in Southern railway. This train got updated with modern LHB coaches from 30 June 2019.\n\n== Background ==\nOn 15{{nbsp}}August 1977 at 6 am, Down Train No. 135 Vaigai Express began its inaugural journey from Madurai to [[Chennai Egmore|Madras Egmore]], with 16 yellow and green livery coaches and a matching YDM4 diesel loco. When it was introduced in 1977, this train had 16 coaches, hauled by twin-YDM4 diesel locos, and by 1984 it was bifurcated as the [[Pallavan Express]], comprising eight coaches.\nThe Vaigai express clocked the fastest run between Madurai and Madras Egmore over a distance of {{convert|497|km}} on the first day in 7 hours and 5 minutes when it entered [[Chennai Egmore|Madras Egmore]] at 1.05 p.m. that afternoon, matching the speed of many Broad Gauge super fast trains on the SR. For safety purposes the train, was slowed down to a journey time of 7 hours and 40 minutes later on. It was the only train in SR which had completely tube lighted interiors and sun control sliding glass shutters installed for the first time in all its eight-second class coaches. The driver and the guard also had a corded telephone system to communicate. With the turntable facility available at Trichy, Chennai and Madurai, the operations staff always ensured that the YDM4 hauling the Vaigai Express always had the short hood facing the front every time its started it journey.\n\nThis train also was one of its kind in SR which had its livery changed a number of times from its original yellow-green combination to white-gray-red livery and then again to vermillon red - cream livery and again to cream-brown livery on the MG. The YDM4 for the Vaigai Express had been fitted with a double-tone horn which made it easy for rail users and railway staff alike to identify the loco as well as the train, which was never on use on the other YDM4s which operated on the same route for other trains. This the only MG train on the SR to be fitted with specially enhanced buffers and certified to run at 110&nbsp;km/h. For the first time on the MG, the ICF manufactured two 40-seat AC chair car coaches exclusively for the Vaigai and Pallavan express. From 12{{nbsp}}February 2014, the Vaigai Express is being hauled by  electric locomotive WAP-4 from Arakkonam & Erode Loco Shed & WAP-7 from Royapuram Loco Shed from Madurai to Chennai Egmore.\n\n== Accident of Vaigai  Express ==\nAugust 1978 to January 1979  Vaigai Express was involved  in accidents twice.  On 21st  December 1978 it dashed against two boulders between Talanallur and Vriddhachalam Town stations and on 22 December 1978 it derailed at Tiruchirappalli station. <ref> https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2057/1/lsd_06_07_01-03-1979.pdf Page no. 98 </ref>\n\n== Rakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:orange;\"| Loco\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightpink;\"| 1\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 2\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 3\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 4\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 5\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lime;\" | 6\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 7\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 8\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 9\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 10\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 11\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:cyan;\" | 12\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 13\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 14\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 15\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 16\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 17\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 18\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 19\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 20\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:yellow;\" | 21\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\" | 22\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\" | 23\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:lightpink;\" | 24\n|-\n|[[File:BSicon LDER.svg|25px]]|| EOG || UR || C1 || C2 || C3 || D1 || D2 || D3 || D4 || D5 || D6 ||D7||PC|| D8|| D9 || D10 || D11 || D12 || D13 || UR || UR || EOG \n|}\n<br />\n\n==Enroute==\nTrain number 12636 leaves {{rws|Madurai Junction}} at 7:00 am and arrives at [[Tiruchirappalli Junction|Trichy Junction]] at 9:00 am before reaching {{rws|Chennai Egmore}} at 2:35 pm.

A former [[midfielder]], who was also capable of playing mostly as a [[right winger]] and [[Forward (association football)|second stricker]], he is considered one of the greatest Polish players of all time,<ref name=\"planetworldcup\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/LEGENDS/boniek.html|title=Zbigniew Boniek|publisher=PlanetWorldCup.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|100 best living footballers in 2004]].<ref name=\"FIFA 100\"/>\n\nIn an 80-cap international career, he scored 24 goals and played at three consecutive World Cups, helping Poland to 3rd place in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and making the Team of the Tournament. His greatest achievements in club football were at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in Italy, winning the [[Serie A]], [[Coppa Italia]], [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], and [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] between 1983 and 1985, being the first Polish footballer to win a [[UEFA competitions|confederation title]] and the first [[Eastern Europe]]an player to do so with a non-conational club.\n\nIn the early 1990s he managed several Italian clubs, and also the Polish national team in 2002. In 2019 he was inducted in the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Club career==\nBoniek was born in [[Bydgoszcz]]. He first played for Polish clubs [[Zawisza Bydgoszcz]] and later at [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nBoniek transferred to Italian football giants [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 1982. With Juventus he won the [[Coppa Italia]] in his [[1982\u201383 Serie A|first season]], also managing a second place finish in the league and reaching the [[1983 European Cup Final]] in the same season. The [[1983\u201384 Serie A|following season]], his performances proved decisive, as Juventus won both the [[Serie A]] title and the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1984, with Boniek scoring the matching-winning goal in the 2\u20131 victory over [[FC Porto|Porto]] in the [[1984 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] of the latter tournament in Basel; he followed up these victories by claiming the [[European Super Cup]] later that year, scoring twice in the 2\u20130 win against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He also won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], against Liverpool once again, winning the penalty that [[Michel Platini]] subsequently converted to win the title for Juventus, although the team's victory was largely overshadowed by the [[Heysel Disaster]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"bello di notte\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\">{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/boniek-zbigniew.html|title=BONIEK Zbigniew: il bello di notte|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"fifa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=160825/profile.html|title=Juve and Poland's Beauty of the Night|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1985\u201386 Serie A|following season]], Boniek joined [[A.S.

He took part at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]s with Poland.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\nAlthough he initially only appeared as a substitute in Poland's two opening group matches at the 1978 World Cup, he drew attention to himself when he scored two goals in a 3\u20131 victory over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in Poland's final match of the group stage, helping his nation top their group; in the second round, however, Poland finished third in their group and were eliminated from the tournament.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\nBoniek later starred in the Polish team that won a bronze medal at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain: he helped his team reach the semi-finals of the tournament, scoring 4 goals in the process. In the first round, he scored in a 5\u20131 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] on 22 June, to help Poland top their group; in the second round, he scored a hat-trick in his nation's 3\u20130 second round victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], in Barcelona, on 28 June,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/29/sports/boniek-is-the-whole-show-for-poland.html|title=BONIEK IS THE WHOLE SHOW FOR POLAND|newspaper=The New York Times|author1=GEORGE VECSEY|date=29 June 1982|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> but was forced to miss the semi-final defeat to eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] due to a suspension after being booked in the 88th minute of a 0\u20130 draw against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\nHe returned to the starting line-up for the victorious third-place match against [[France national football team|France]] and was named to the team of the tournament for his performances throughout the competition. The 1986 World Cup was less successful, as Poland only qualified for the second round as the second best third-placed team, and were subsequently eliminated in the second round following a 4\u20130 defeat to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\n==Style of play==\nAlthough Boniek was usually deployed as a [[midfielder]], he was also able to play as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. He preferred to operate between the lines in a free role, although he was a versatile player, capable of playing in several offensive and midfield positions on either flank or through the centre, and throughout his career he was deployed as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]], in a [[Playmaker|playmaking]] role as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]], or as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]]; his Juventus manager, [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], however, often struggled to find the most suitable position for him.\n\nBoniek was known for his extroverted personality and his trademark moustache, which made him a highly recognisable player. A tall, brave and hard-working footballer with a large, powerful, and slender physique, he was known for his blistering pace, acceleration, and quick reactions. In particular, Boniek was highly regarded for his ability to make sudden attacking runs to beat the defensive line and get on the end of his teammates' long passes, especially those of [[Michel Platini]], with whom he formed a close friendship and formidable partnership at the Turin club, which made him lethal on counterattacks; this prompted [[Diego Maradona]] to describe Boniek as the best counterattacking player in the world.\n\nA highly talented, creative, intelligent, and skilful footballer, he was one of the best [[Dribbling#Association football|dribblers]] of his time and also displayed superb technique, flair, and class. Although he was not a particularly prolific player, he was known for his eye for goal, and as his clinical finishing with either foot, as well as his head, which enabled him to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate throughout his career; he also earned a reputation for having the tendency to score decisive goals for his team in key matches.\n\nDespite his ability, at times he was also criticised, however, for being tactically undisciplined, inconsistent, too static in his movements off the ball, and for not being involved enough in his team's play during matches, which led him to struggle against opponents who did not give him a lot of space.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-zbigniew-boniek-359493|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Zbigniew BONIEK|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author1=Stefano Bedeschi|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bello di notte\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-04-08/pope-regretted-not-praying-for-polish-team-player/1548080|title=Pope regretted not praying for Polish team: player|publisher=ABC|date=8 April 2005|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/top-10-goals-spain-82|title=Top 10: Goals of Spain '82|magazine=FourFourTwo|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.espn.com/soccer/story?storyId=266276&wjb=|title=Real warned not to underestimate Juve|publisher=ESPN|author1=Nick Bidwell|date=6 May 2003|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Juventus president at the time of Boniek's tenure with the club, [[Gianni Agnelli]], nicknamed him ''Bello di notte'' (\"Beauty at night\", which is a play on the title of the [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] movie ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'') because of his excellent performances in European club tournament matches, which were played in the evening; indeed, during continental tournaments, his opponents usually allowed him more space and time on the ball than in Serie A, which allowed him to get forward, undertake individual dribbling runs and score goals himself, or drop deep, link up with midfielders and create chances or provide [[Assist (football)|assists]] for his teammates, courtesy of his passing, vision, and clever movement.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"bello di notte\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Primo_Piano/2008/10/31/boniek.shtml|title=Zib\u00ec Boniek, il bello di notte che fece litigare Roma e Juve|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Giuseppe Bagnati|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/zico-perfect-xi|title=Zico: Perfect XI|magazine=FourFourTwo|date=1 November 2005|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> He was also nicknamed Zib\u00ec by the Italian press.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nTowards the end of his career, as he lost his pace, he often functioned in a defensive role as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]].<ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\n==Managerial career==\nFollowing his retirement, Boniek pursued a coaching career, but with less success; he also coached in Italy, with stints at [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in 1990\u201391, [[A.S.

A former [[midfielder]], who was also capable of playing mostly as a [[right winger]] and [[Forward (association football)|second stricker]], he is considered one of the greatest Polish players of all time,<ref name=\"planetworldcup\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/LEGENDS/boniek.html|title=Zbigniew Boniek|publisher=PlanetWorldCup.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|100 best living footballers in 2004]].<ref name=\"FIFA 100\"/>\n\nIn an 80-cap international career, he scored 24 goals and played at three consecutive World Cups, helping Poland to 3rd place in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and making the Team of the Tournament. His greatest achievements in club football were at [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in Italy, winning the [[Serie A]], [[Coppa Italia]], [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], and [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] between 1983 and 1985, being the first Polish footballer to win a [[UEFA competitions|confederation title]] and the first [[Eastern Europe]]an player to do so with a non-conational club.\n\nIn the early 1990s he managed several Italian clubs, and also the Polish national team in 2002. In 2019 he was inducted in the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Club career==\nBoniek first played for Polish clubs [[Zawisza Bydgoszcz]] and later at [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nBoniek transferred to Italian football giants [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 1982. With Juventus he won the [[Coppa Italia]] in his [[1982\u201383 Serie A|first season]], also managing a second place finish in the league and reaching the [[1983 European Cup Final]] in the same season. The [[1983\u201384 Serie A|following season]], his performances proved decisive, as Juventus won both the [[Serie A]] title and the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1984, with Boniek scoring the matching-winning goal in the 2\u20131 victory over [[FC Porto|Porto]] in the [[1984 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] of the latter tournament in Basel; he followed up these victories by claiming the [[European Super Cup]] later that year, scoring twice in the 2\u20130 win against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He also won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], against Liverpool once again, winning the penalty that [[Michel Platini]] subsequently converted to win the title for Juventus, although the team's victory was largely overshadowed by the [[Heysel Disaster]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"bello di notte\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\">{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/boniek-zbigniew.html|title=BONIEK Zbigniew: il bello di notte|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"fifa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=160825/profile.html|title=Juve and Poland's Beauty of the Night|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1985\u201386 Serie A|following season]], Boniek joined [[A.S.

In the first round, he scored in a 5\u20131 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] on 22 June, to help Poland top their group; in the second round, he scored a hat-trick in his nation's 3\u20130 second round victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], in Barcelona, on 28 June,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/29/sports/boniek-is-the-whole-show-for-poland.html|title=BONIEK IS THE WHOLE SHOW FOR POLAND|newspaper=The New York Times|author1=GEORGE VECSEY|date=29 June 1982|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> but was forced to miss the semi-final defeat to eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] due to a suspension after being booked in the 88th minute of a 0\u20130 draw against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\nHe returned to the starting line-up for the victorious third-place match against [[France national football team|France]] and was named to the team of the tournament for his performances throughout the competition. The 1986 World Cup was less successful, as Poland only qualified for the second round as the second best third-placed team, and were subsequently eliminated in the second round following a 4\u20130 defeat to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\n==Style of play==\nAlthough Boniek was usually deployed as a [[midfielder]], he was also able to play as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. He preferred to operate between the lines in a free role, although he was a versatile player, capable of playing in several offensive and midfield positions on either flank or through the centre, and throughout his career he was deployed as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]], in a [[Playmaker|playmaking]] role as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]], or as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]]; his Juventus manager, [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], however, often struggled to find the most suitable position for him.\n\nBoniek was known for his extroverted personality and his trademark moustache, which made him a highly recognisable player. A tall, brave and hard-working footballer with a large, powerful, and slender physique, he was known for his blistering pace, acceleration, and quick reactions. In particular, Boniek was highly regarded for his ability to make sudden attacking runs to beat the defensive line and get on the end of his teammates' long passes, especially those of [[Michel Platini]], with whom he formed a close friendship and formidable partnership at the Turin club, which made him lethal on counterattacks; this prompted [[Diego Maradona]] to describe Boniek as the best counterattacking player in the world.\n\nA highly talented, creative, intelligent, and skilful footballer, he was one of the best [[Dribbling#Association football|dribblers]] of his time and also displayed superb technique, flair, and class. Although he was not a particularly prolific player, he was known for his eye for goal, and as his clinical finishing with either foot, as well as his head, which enabled him to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate throughout his career; he also earned a reputation for having the tendency to score decisive goals for his team in key matches.\n\nDespite his ability, at times he was also criticised, however, for being tactically undisciplined, inconsistent, too static in his movements off the ball, and for not being involved enough in his team's play during matches, which led him to struggle against opponents who did not give him a lot of space.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-zbigniew-boniek-359493|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Zbigniew BONIEK|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author1=Stefano Bedeschi|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bello di notte\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-04-08/pope-regretted-not-praying-for-polish-team-player/1548080|title=Pope regretted not praying for Polish team: player|publisher=ABC|date=8 April 2005|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/top-10-goals-spain-82|title=Top 10: Goals of Spain '82|magazine=FourFourTwo|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.espn.com/soccer/story?storyId=266276&wjb=|title=Real warned not to underestimate Juve|publisher=ESPN|author1=Nick Bidwell|date=6 May 2003|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Juventus president at the time of Boniek's tenure with the club, [[Gianni Agnelli]], nicknamed him ''Bello di notte'' (\"Beauty at night\", which is a play on the title of the [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] movie ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'') because of his excellent performances in European club tournament matches, which were played in the evening; indeed, during continental tournaments, his opponents usually allowed him more space and time on the ball than in Serie A, which allowed him to get forward, undertake individual dribbling runs and score goals himself, or drop deep, link up with midfielders and create chances or provide [[Assist (football)|assists]] for his teammates, courtesy of his passing, vision, and clever movement.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref name=\"bello di notte\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Primo_Piano/2008/10/31/boniek.shtml|title=Zib\u00ec Boniek, il bello di notte che fece litigare Roma e Juve|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Giuseppe Bagnati|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"storiedicalcio\"/><ref name=\"fifa\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/zico-perfect-xi|title=Zico: Perfect XI|magazine=FourFourTwo|date=1 November 2005|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> He was also nicknamed Zib\u00ec by the Italian press.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nTowards the end of his career, as he lost his pace, he often functioned in a defensive role as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]].<ref name=\"fifa\"/>\n\n==Managerial career==\nFollowing his retirement, Boniek pursued a coaching career, but with less success; he also coached in Italy, with stints at [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in 1990\u201391, [[A.S.

The bottom panel shows 2-step hydrolysis where a residue within the enzyme is activated to act as a [[nucleophile]] (Nu) and attack the substrate. This forms an intermediate where the enzyme is covalently linked to the N-terminal half of the substrate. In a second step, water is activated to hydrolyse this intermediate and complete catalysis. Other enzyme residues (not shown) donate and accept hydrogens and electrostatically stabilise charge build-up along the reaction mechanism.]]\n{{see also|Catalytic triad}}\nProteases are involved in [[digestion|digesting]] long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the [[peptide bonds]] that link [[amino acid]] residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain ([[exopeptidases]], such as [[aminopeptidase]]s, [[carboxypeptidase A]]); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein ([[endopeptidases]], such as [[trypsin]], [[chymotrypsin]], [[pepsin]], [[papain]], [[elastase]]).\n\n===Catalysis===\n[[Catalysis]] is achieved by one of two mechanisms:\n*Aspartic, glutamic and metallo- proteases activate a water molecule which performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond to hydrolyse it. \n*Serine, threonine and cysteine proteases use a nucleophilic residue (usually in a [[catalytic triad]]). That residue performs a nucleophilic attack to [[covalent]]ly link the protease to the substrate protein, releasing the first half of the product. This covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate is then hydrolysed by activated water to complete catalysis by releasing the second half of the product and regenerating the free enzyye.\n\n===Specificity===\nProteolysis can be highly [[enzyme promiscuity|promiscuous]] such that a wide range of protein substrates are hydrolysed. This is the case for digestive enzymes such as [[trypsin]] which have to be able to cleave the array of proteins ingested into smaller peptide fragments. Promiscuous proteases typically bind to a single amino acid on the substrate and so only have specificity for that residue. For example, [[trypsin]] is specific for the sequences ...K\\... or ...R\\... ('\\'=cleavage site).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez J, Gupta N, Smith RD, Pevzner PA | title = Does trypsin cut before proline? | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 300\u20135 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18067249 | doi = 10.1021/pr0705035 }}</ref>\n\nConversely some proteases are highly specific and only cleave substrates with a certain sequence. Blood clotting (such as [[thrombin]]) and viral polyprotein processing (such as [[TEV protease]]) requires this level of specificity in order to achieve precise cleavage events. This is achieved by proteases having a long binding cleft or tunnel with several pockets along it which bind the specified residues. For example, [[TEV protease]] is specific for the sequence ...ENLYFQ\\S...

This acts as a method of regulation of protease activity. Some proteases are less active after autolysis (e.g. [[TEV protease]]) whilst others are more active (e.g. [[trypsinogen]]).\n\n==Biodiversity of proteases==\nProteases occur in all organisms, from [[prokaryote]]s to [[eukaryote]]s to [[virus]]es. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g., the [[coagulation|blood-clotting\n cascade]], the [[complement system]], [[apoptosis]] pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (''limited proteolysis''), depending on the [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, or completely break down a peptide to amino acids (''unlimited proteolysis''). The activity can be a destructive change (abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components), it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway.\n\n===Plants===\nProtease containing plant-solutions called '''[[Rennet#Vegetable|vegetarian rennet]]''' has been in use for hundreds of years in Europe and middle-east for making [[Cheese#Cultural attitudes|kosher and halal Cheeses]]. Vegetarian rennet from [[Withania coagulans]] has been in use for thousands of years as [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] remedy for digestion and diabetes in the Indian subcontinent.

Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as [[pepsin]]) and serine proteases present in [[duodenum]] ([[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) enable us to digest the protein in food. Proteases present in blood serum ([[thrombin]], [[plasmin]], [[Hageman factor]], etc.) play important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes ([[elastase]], [[cathepsin G]]) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some [[snake venoms]] are also proteases, such as [[pit viper]] [[haemotoxin]] and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological role like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes. This is one of the fastest \"switching on\" and \"switching off\" regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism.\n\nBy complex cooperative action the proteases may proceed as [[biochemical cascade|cascade]] reactions, which result in rapid and efficient amplification of an organism's response to a physiological signal.\n\n===Bacteria===\nBacteria secrete proteases to [[hydrolyse]] the peptide bonds in proteins and therefore break the proteins down into their constituent [[amino acid]]s.

The bottom panel shows 2-step hydrolysis where a residue within the enzyme is activated to act as a [[nucleophile]] (Nu) and attack the substrate. This forms an intermediate where the enzyme is covalently linked to the N-terminal half of the substrate. In a second step, water is activated to hydrolyse this intermediate and complete catalysis. Other enzyme residues (not shown) donate and accept hydrogens and electrostatically stabilise charge build-up along the reaction mechanism.]]\n{{see also|Catalytic triad}}\nProteases are involved in [[digestion|digesting]] long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the [[peptide bonds]] that link [[amino acid]] residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain ([[exopeptidases]], such as [[aminopeptidase]]s, [[carboxypeptidase A]]); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein ([[endopeptidases]], such as [[trypsin]], [[chymotrypsin]], [[pepsin]], [[papain]], [[elastase]]).\n\n===Catalysis===\n[[Catalysis]] is achieved by one of two mechanisms:\n*Aspartic, glutamic and metallo- proteases activate a water molecule which performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond to hydrolyse it. \n*Serine, threonine and cysteine proteases use a nucleophilic residue (usually in a [[catalytic triad]]). That residue performs a nucleophilic attack to [[covalent]]ly link the protease to the substrate protein, releasing the first half of the product. This covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate is then hydrolysed by activated water to complete catalysis by releasing the second half of the product and regenerating the free enzyme.\n\n===Specificity===\nProteolysis can be highly [[enzyme promiscuity|promiscuous]] such that a wide range of protein substrates are hydrolysed. This is the case for digestive enzymes such as [[trypsin]] which have to be able to cleave the array of proteins ingested into smaller peptide fragments. Promiscuous proteases typically bind to a single amino acid on the substrate and so only have specificity for that residue. For example, [[trypsin]] is specific for the sequences ...K\\... or ...R\\... ('\\'=cleavage site).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez J, Gupta N, Smith RD, Pevzner PA | title = Does trypsin cut before proline? | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 300\u20135 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18067249 | doi = 10.1021/pr0705035 }}</ref>\n\nConversely some proteases are highly specific and only cleave substrates with a certain sequence. Blood clotting (such as [[thrombin]]) and viral polyprotein processing (such as [[TEV protease]]) requires this level of specificity in order to achieve precise cleavage events. This is achieved by proteases having a long binding cleft or tunnel with several pockets along it which bind the specified residues. For example, [[TEV protease]] is specific for the sequence ...ENLYFQ\\S...

This acts as a method of regulation of protease activity. Some proteases are less active after autolysis (e.g. [[TEV protease]]) whilst others are more active (e.g. [[trypsinogen]]).\n\n==Biodiversity of proteases==\nProteases occur in all organisms, from [[prokaryote]]s to [[eukaryote]]s to [[virus]]es. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g., the [[coagulation|blood-clotting\n cascade]], the [[complement system]], [[apoptosis]] pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (''limited proteolysis''), depending on the [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, or completely break down a peptide to amino acids (''unlimited proteolysis''). The activity can be a destructive change (abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components), it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway.\n\n===Plants===\nProtease containing plant-solutions called '''[[Rennet#Vegetable|vegetarian rennet]]''' has been in use for hundreds of years in Europe and middle-east for making [[Cheese#Cultural attitudes|kosher and halal Cheeses]]. Vegetarian rennet from [[Withania coagulans]] has been in use for thousands of years as [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] remedy for digestion and diabetes in the Indian subcontinent.

Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as [[pepsin]]) and serine proteases present in [[duodenum]] ([[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) enable us to digest the protein in food. Proteases present in blood serum ([[thrombin]], [[plasmin]], [[Hageman factor]], etc.) play important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes ([[elastase]], [[cathepsin G]]) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some [[snake venoms]] are also proteases, such as [[pit viper]] [[haemotoxin]] and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological role like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes. This is one of the fastest \"switching on\" and \"switching off\" regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism.\n\nBy complex cooperative action the proteases may proceed as [[biochemical cascade|cascade]] reactions, which result in rapid and efficient amplification of an organism's response to a physiological signal.\n\n===Bacteria===\nBacteria secrete proteases to [[hydrolyse]] the peptide bonds in proteins and therefore break the proteins down into their constituent [[amino acid]]s.
