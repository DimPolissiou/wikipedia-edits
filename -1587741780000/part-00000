Although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any art movement, he is generally identified as an [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]].\n\n==Childhood==\nMark Rothko was born in [[Daugavpils]], Latvia (then in Russian Empire). His father, Jacob (Yakov) Rothkowitz, was a [[pharmacist]] and an intellectual who initially provided his children with a secular and political, rather than religious, upbringing. According to Rothko, his [[Marxist schools of thought|pro-Marxist]] father was \"violently anti-religious\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-newish-biography-of-mark-rothko/#!|title=A Newish Biography of Mark Rothko|last=Glueck|first=Grace|date=11 October 2016|work=|newspaper=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2016-10-22|via=}}</ref> In an environment where Jews were often blamed for many of the evils that befell Russia, Rothko's early childhood was plagued by fear.<ref>Biographical information for this entry is taken from {{harvnb|Breslin|1993}} and {{harvnb|Ashton|1983}}.</ref>\n\nDespite Jacob Rothkowitz's modest income, the family was highly educated (\"We were a reading family\", Rothko's sister recalled),<ref>Breslin, p. 14.</ref> and Rothko was able to speak Lithuanian [[Yiddish]] ([[Yiddish dialects|Litvish]]), Hebrew and Russian.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Following his father's return to the [[Orthodox Judaism]] of his own youth, Rothko, the youngest of four siblings, was sent to the [[cheder]] at the age of five, where he studied the [[Talmud]], although his elder siblings had been educated in the public school system.<ref>Breslin, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n==Emigration from Russia to the U.S.==\nFearing that his elder sons were about to be drafted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]], Jacob Rothkowitz emigrated from Russia to the United States. Markus remained in Russia, with his mother and elder sister Sonia. They arrived as immigrants, at [[Ellis Island]], in late 1913. From that point, they crossed the country, to join Jacob and the elder brothers, in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Jacob's death, a few months later, from [[colon cancer]],<ref name=\":0\" /> left the family without economic support. Sonia operated a cash register, while Markus worked in one of his uncle's warehouses, selling newspapers to employees.<ref>Breslin, pp. 21\u201322, 24, 32.</ref> His father's death also led Rothko to sever his ties with religion. After he had mourned his father's death for almost a year at a local synagogue, he vowed never to set foot in it again.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRothko started school in the United States in 1913, quickly accelerating from third to fifth grade. In June 1921, he completed the secondary level, with honors, at [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], at the age of seventeen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/rothko_mark_1903_1970_/#.XjsijyMwj-k|title=Mark Rothko {{!}} The Oregon Encyclopedia|website=www.oregonencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\nHe learned his fourth language, English, and became an active member of the Jewish community center, where he proved adept at political discussions. Like his father, Rothko was passionate about issues such as workers' rights, and women's right to contraception.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} At the time, Portland was a center of revolutionary activity in the U.S. and the region where the revolutionary syndicalist union [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) was strongest.\n\nRothko, having grown up around radical workers' meetings, attended meetings of the IWW, including [[Anarchism|anarchists]] such as [[Bill Haywood]] and [[Emma Goldman]], where he developed strong oratorical skills he would later use in defense of [[Surrealism]]. He heard [[Emma Goldman]] speak on one of her West Coast activist lecture tours.<ref>Breslin, pp. 34\u201335.</ref> With the onset of the [[Russian Revolution]], Rothko organized debates about it. Despite the repressive political atmosphere, he wished to become a labor [[union organizer]].\n\nRothko received a scholarship to [[Yale University|Yale]]. At the end of his freshman year in 1922, the scholarship was not renewed, and he worked as a waiter and delivery boy to support his studies. He found the Yale community to be [[elitist]] and [[racist]]. Rothko and a friend, [[Aaron Director]], started a satirical magazine, ''The Yale Saturday Evening Pest'', which lampooned the school's stuffy, [[bourgeois]] tone.<ref>Stigler, Stephen M., \"Aaron Director Remembered\". 48 J. Law and Econ. 307, 2005.</ref> Rothko's nature was more that of a [[self-taught]] man than a diligent pupil: \"One of his fellow students remembers that he hardly seemed to study, but that he was a voracious reader.\"<ref>Ashton, p. 10.</ref> At the end of his sophomore year, Rothko dropped out, and did not return until he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], forty-six years later.<ref>Breslin, pp. 47\u201354.</ref>\n\n'''''==Early career==\nIn the autumn of 1923, Rothko found work in [[Garment District, Manhattan|New York's garment district]]. While visiting a friend at the [[Art Students League of New York]], he saw students sketching a model. According to Rothko, this was the beginning of his life as an artist.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  He later enrolled in the [[Parsons The New School for Design]], where one of his instructors was [[Arshile Gorky]]. Rothko characterized Gorky's leadership of the class as \"overcharged with supervision.\"<ref>Hayden Herrera, ''Arshile Gorky: His Life and Work'' (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 2003), pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> That same autumn, he took courses at the Art Students League taught by Cubist artist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], a fellow [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jew]] who had been a part of the French avant-garde movement. To his students eager to know about [[Modernism]], Weber was seen as \"a living repository of modern art history\".<ref>Ashton, p. 11.</ref> Under Weber's tutelage, Rothko began to view art as a tool of emotional and religious expression. Rothko's paintings from this era reveal the influence of his instructor.<ref>Breslin, pp. 62\u201363. Ashton, an art historian and close friend of Rothko's, goes further: \"Weber presided over [Rothko's] early development\" (p. 19).</ref> Years later, when Weber attended a show of his former student's work and expressed his admiration, Rothko was immensely pleased.<ref>Ashton, p. 69.</ref>\n\n===Rothko's circle===\nRothko's move to New York landed him in a fertile artistic atmosphere. Modernist painters were having more shows in New York galleries all the time, and the city's museums were an invaluable resource for a budding artist's knowledge and skills. Among the important early influences on him were the works of the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]], the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] art of [[Paul Klee]], and the paintings of [[Georges Rouault]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1928, with a group of other young artists, Rothko exhibited works at the Opportunity Gallery.<ref name=\"AAA\" /> His paintings, including dark, moody, expressionist interiors and urban scenes, were generally well accepted among critics and peers. To supplement his income, in 1929 Rothko began instructing schoolchildren in drawing, painting and clay sculpture at the Center Academy of the Brooklyn Jewish Center, where he would remain active in teaching at that location for twenty-two years, until 1952.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Rothko met [[Adolph Gottlieb]], who, along with [[Barnett Newman]], [[Joseph Solman]], [[Louis Schanker]], and [[John D. Graham|John Graham]], was part of a group of young artists surrounding the painter [[Milton Avery]]. According to [[Elaine de Kooning]], it was Avery who \"gave Rothko the idea that [the life of a professional artist] was a possibility.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 91</ref> Avery's abstract nature paintings, utilizing a rich knowledge of form and color, had a tremendous influence on him.<ref name=\"AAA\">{{cite web | author=| year=2011 | title=Oral history interview with Sally Avery, 1982 Feb. 19 | work=Oral history interviews | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-sally-avery-12685 | accessdate=18 Jun 2011}}</ref> Soon, Rothko's paintings took on subject matter and color similar to Avery's, as seen in ''Bathers, or Beach Scene'' of 1933\u20131934.<ref>On Avery's impact on Rothko: Ashton, pp. 21\u201325.</ref>\n\nRothko, Gottlieb, Newman, Solman, Graham, and their mentor, Avery, spent considerable time together, vacationing at [[Lake George, New York]], and [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. In the daytime they painted, then discussed art in the evenings. During a 1932 visit to Lake George, Rothko met Edith Sachar, a jewelry designer, whom he married later that year.<ref>Breslin, p. 81.</ref> The following summer, his first one-person show was held at the [[Portland Art Museum]], consisting mostly of drawings and [[aquarelle]]s. For this exhibition, Rothko took the very unusual step of displaying works done by his pre-adolescent students from the Center Academy, alongside his own.<ref>Ashton, p. 26. She writes: \"Child art, for Rothko, was a kind of touchstone, a barometer of truth.\"</ref> His family was unable to understand Rothko's decision to be an artist, especially considering the dire economic situation of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jahn |first=Jeff |url=http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2008/03/rothko_in_portl.html |title=PORT |publisher=Portlandart.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> Having suffered serious financial setbacks, the Rothkowitzes were mystified by Rothko's seeming indifference to financial necessity. They felt he was doing his mother a disservice by not finding a more lucrative and realistic career.<ref>Breslin, pp. 57, 89.</ref>\n\n===First solo show in New York===\nReturning to New York, Rothko had his first East Coast one-person show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery.<ref>Breslin, p. 87.</ref> He showed fifteen oil paintings, mostly portraits, along with some aquarelles and drawings. Among these works, the oil paintings especially captured the art critics' eyes. Rothko's use of rich fields of colors moved beyond Avery's influence. In late 1935, Rothko joined with [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], Ben-Zion, Adolph Gottlieb, Lou Harris, [[Ralph Rosenborg]], [[Louis Schanker]] and [[Joseph Solman]] to form \"[http://www.LouisSchanker.info/tendisc.htm The Ten]\" (Whitney Ten Dissenters). According to a gallery show catalog, the mission of the group was \"to protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting and literal painting.\"<ref>Breslin, pp. 101\u2013106.</ref>\n\nRothko was earning a growing reputation among his peers, particularly among the group that formed the Artists' Union.<ref>Ashton, pp. 30\u201332.</ref> The Artists' Union, including Gottlieb and Solman, hoped to create a municipal art gallery, to show self-organized group exhibitions. In 1936, the group exhibited at the Galerie Bonaparte in France, which resulted in some positive critical attention. One reviewer remarked that Rothko's paintings \"display authentic coloristic values.\"<ref>Ashton, 35.</ref> Later, in 1938, a show was held at the Mercury Gallery in New York, intended as a protest against the Whitney Museum of American Art, which the group regarded as having a provincial, regionalist agenda. Also during this period, Rothko, like Avery, Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, and many others, found employment with the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref>Breslin, p. 121.</ref>\n\n===Development of style===\nIn 1936, Rothko began writing a book, never completed, about similarities in the art of children and the work of modern painters.<ref>Breslin, pp. 130\u2013137.</ref> According to Rothko, the work of modernists, influenced by primitive art, could be compared to that of children in that \"child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a mimicry of himself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on art|last=Rothko|first=Mark|last2=L\u00f3pez-Remiro|first2=Miguel|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780300114409|location=New Haven|pages=[https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/8 8]|language=English|oclc=1008510353|url=https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/8}}</ref> In this manuscript, he observed: \"Tradition of starting with drawing in academic notion We may start with color.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on art|last=Rothko|first=Mark|last2=L\u00f3pez-Remiro|first2=Miguel|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300114409|location=New Haven|pages=[https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/6 6]|language=English|oclc=1008510353|url=https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/6}}</ref> Rothko was using fields of color in his aquarelles and city scenes. His style was already evolving in the direction of his renowned later works. Despite this newfound exploration of color, Rothko turned his attention to other formal and stylistic innovations, inaugurating a period of surrealist paintings influenced by mythological fables and symbols.\n\nRothko's work later matured from representation and mythological subjects into rectangular fields of color and light, culminating in his final works for the [[Rothko Chapel]]. Between his early style of primitivist and playful urban'''Bold text''' scenes, and his later style of transcendent color fields, was a long period of transition. This development was marked by two important events in Rothko's life: the onset of [[World War II]], and his reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n'''''\n\n==Maturity==\n[[File:Consuelo Kanaga, Mark Rothko, Yorktown Heights, ca. 1949.jpg|thumb|right|''Mark Rothko, Yorktown Heights'', ca. 1949. [[Brooklyn Museum]], by [[Consuelo Kanaga]]]]\nRothko separated temporarily from his wife Edith in mid-1937. They reconciled several months later, but their relationship remained tense.<ref>Breslin, p. 144.</ref> On February 21, 1938, Rothko finally became a citizen of the United States, prompted by fears that the growing [[Nazi]] influence in Europe might provoke sudden deportation of American Jews. Concerned about [[anti-Semitism]] in America and Europe, Rothko in 1940 abbreviated his name from \"Markus Rothkowitz\" to \"Mark Rothko\". The name \"Roth\", a common abbreviation, was still identifiably Jewish, so he settled upon \"Rothko.\"<ref>Baal-Teshuva, p. 31.</ref><ref name=Haaretz>https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-this-day-mark-rothko-is-found-dead-1.5231350</ref>\n\n===Inspiration from mythology===\nFearing that modern American painting had reached a conceptual dead end, Rothko was intent upon exploring subjects other than urban and nature scenes. He sought subjects that would complement his growing interest with form, space, and color. The world crisis of war gave this search a sense of immediacy. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  He insisted that the new subject matter have a social impact, yet be able to transcend the confines of current political symbols and values. In his essay \"The [[Romantics]] Were Prompted,\" published in 1948, Rothko argued that the \"archaic artist ... found it necessary to create a group of intermediaries, monsters, hybrids, gods and demigods,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theoria.art-zoo.com/the-romantics-were-prompted-mark-rothko/|title=The Romantics Were Prompted,\" Mark Rothko, ''Possibilities'', No. 1, p. 84 {{!}} ''Possibilities'', No. 1, Winter 1947-48|website=www.theoria.art-zoo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> in much the same way that modern man found intermediaries in [[Fascism]] and the [[Communist Party]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  For Rothko, \"without monsters and gods, art cannot enact a drama\".<ref>Breslin, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRothko's use of [[mythology]] as a commentary on current history was not novel. Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman read and discussed the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mo.ma/2udiCWD|title=Jackson Pollock: Interviews, Articles, and Reviews.

They understood mythological symbols as images, operating in a space of human consciousness, which transcends specific history and culture.<ref>Ashton, pp. 40\u201350.</ref> Rothko later said that his artistic approach was \"reformed\" by his study of the \"dramatic themes of myth\". He allegedly stopped painting altogether in 1940, to immerse himself in reading [[James Frazer|Sir James Frazer's]] study of mythology ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', and Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.<ref>Breslin, p. 160.</ref>\n\n===Nietzsche's influence===\nRothko's new vision attempted to address modern man's spiritual and creative mythological requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/features/mark-rothko/mark-rothko-early-years.html|title=\"Mark Rothko: Early Years\" {{!}} National Gallery of Art|website=www.nga.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> The most crucial philosophical influence on Rothko in this period was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.<ref>Ashton, pp. 51\u201357.</ref> Nietzsche claimed that Greek tragedy served to redeem man from the terrors of mortal life. The exploration of novel topics in modern art ceased to be Rothko's goal. From this time on, his art had the goal of relieving modern man's spiritual emptiness. He believed that this emptiness resulted partly from lack of a mythology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} which, according to Nietzsche, \"The images of the myth have to be the unnoticed omnipresent demonic guardians, under whose care the young soul grows to maturity and whose signs help the man to interpret his life and struggles.\"<ref>Nietzsche 1872, \u00a723</ref> Rothko believed his art could free unconscious energies, previously bound by mythological images, symbols, and rituals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/myth-making-abstract-expressionist-painting-united-states|title=\"Myth-Making: Abstract Expressionist Painting From The United States {{!}} The Tate Gallery, 10 March 1992 \u2013 10 January 1993|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> He considered himself a \"mythmaker\", and proclaimed that \"the exhilarated tragic experience is for me the only source of art\".<ref>https://www.theartstory.org/artist/rothko-mark/</ref>\n\nMany of his paintings in this period contrast barbaric scenes of violence with civilized passivity, using imagery drawn primarily from [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Oresteia]]'' [[trilogy]]. A list of Rothko's paintings from this period illustrates his use of myth: ''[[Antigone]]'', ''[[Oedipus]]'', ''The Sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]]'', ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]'', ''[[Erinyes|The Furies]]'', ''Altar of [[Orpheus]]''. Rothko evokes Judeo-Christian imagery in ''Gethsemane'', ''[[The Last Supper]]'', and ''Rites of [[Lilith]]''. He also invokes  Egyptian (''Room in [[Karnak]]'') and Syrian (''The Syrian Bull'') myth. Soon after [[World War II]], Rothko believed his titles limited the larger, transcendent aims of his paintings. To allow maximum interpretation by the viewer, he stopped naming and framing his paintings, referring to them only by numbers.<ref>Wallace, Nora.

In 1936, Rothko attended two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], \"Cubism and Abstract Art\", and \"Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism\".<ref>Ashton, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn 1942, following the success of shows by [[Max Ernst|Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Yves Tanguy|Tanguy]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], artists who had immigrated to the United States because of the war, [[Surrealism]] took New York by storm.<ref>Breslin, p. 181.</ref> Rothko and his peers, [[Adolph Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] and [[Barnett Newman|Newman]], met and discussed the art and ideas of these European pioneers, as well as those of [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]. They began to regard themselves as heirs to the European avant-garde.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nNew paintings were unveiled at a 1942 show at [[Macy's]] department store in New York City. In response to a negative review by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rothko and Gottlieb issued a manifesto, written mainly by Rothko. Addressing the ''Times'' critic's self-professed \"befuddlement\" over the new work, they stated \"We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal. We wish to reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth.\" On a more strident note, they criticised those who wanted to live surrounded by less challenging art, noting that their work necessarily \"must insult anyone who is spiritually attuned to interior decoration\".<ref>Breslin, pp. 191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nRothko's viewed [[myth]] as a replenishing resource for an era of spiritual void. This belief had begun decades earlier, through his reading of [[Carl Jung]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Thomas Mann]], among other authors.<ref>Ashton, p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Break with Surrealism===\nOn June 13, 1943, Rothko and Sachar separated again.<ref>Breslin, p. 170.</ref> Rothko suffered a long depression following their divorce.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}   Thinking that a change of scenery might help, Rothko returned to Portland. From there, he traveled to Berkeley, where he met artist [[Clyfford Still]], and the two began a close friendship.<ref>Breslin, p. 205 and Ashton, pp. 92\u201393.</ref> Still's deeply abstract paintings would be of considerable influence on Rothko's later works. In the autumn of 1943, Rothko returned to New York. He met with noted collector and art dealer [[Peggy Guggenheim]], but she was initially reluctant to take on his artworks.<ref>Breslin, p. 208.</ref> Rothko's one-person show at Guggenheim's [[The Art of This Century Gallery]], in late 1945, resulted in few sales, with prices ranging from $150 to $750. The exhibit also attracted less-than-favorable reviews from critics. During this period, Rothko had been stimulated by Still's abstract landscapes of color, and his style shifted away from surrealism. Rothko's experiments in interpreting the unconscious symbolism of everyday forms had run their course. His future lay with abstraction:\n\n{{quote|I insist upon the equal existence of the world engendered in the mind and the world engendered by God outside of it. If I have faltered in the use of familiar objects, it is because I refuse to mutilate their appearance for the sake of an action which they are too old to serve, or for which perhaps they had never been intended. I quarrel with surrealists and abstract art only as one quarrels with his father and mother; recognizing the inevitability and function of my roots, but insistent upon my dissent; I, being both they, and an integral completely independent of them.<ref>Baal-Teshun, p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nRothko's 1945 masterpiece, ''Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea'', illustrates his newfound propensity towards abstraction. It has been interpreted as a meditation on Rothko's courtship of his second wife, Mary Ellen \"Mell\" Beistle, whom he met in 1944 and married in early 1945. Other readings have noted echoes of Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus'', which Rothko saw at an \"Italian Masters\" loan exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art, in 1940. The painting presents, in subtle grays and browns, two human-like forms embraced in a swirling, floating atmosphere of shapes and colors. The rigid rectangular background foreshadows Rothko's later experiments in pure color. The painting was completed, not coincidentally, in the year the [[Second World War]] ended.<ref>Breslin, pp. 212\u2013216.</ref>\n\nDespite the abandonment of his \"Mythomorphic Abstractionism\", Rothko would still be recognized by the public primarily for his surrealist works, for the remainder of the 1940s. The [[Whitney Museum]] included them in their annual exhibit of contemporary art from 1943 to 1950. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===\"Multiforms\"===\nThe year 1946 saw the creation of what art critics have termed Rothko's transitional \"multiform\" paintings. Rothko never used the term multiform himself, yet it is an accurate description of these paintings. Several of them, including ''No. 18'' and ''Untitled'' (both 1948), are less transitional than fully realized. Rothko himself described these paintings as possessing a more organic structure, and as self-contained units of human expression. For him, these blurred blocks of various colors, devoid of landscape or the human figure, let alone myth and symbol, possessed their own life force. They contained a \"breath of life\" he found lacking in most figurative painting of the era. They were filled with possibility, whereas his experimentation with mythological symbolism had become a tired formula. The \"multiforms\" brought Rothko to a realization of his mature, signature style, the only style Rothko would never fully abandon.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the middle of this crucial period of transition, Rothko had been impressed by [[Clyfford Still]]'s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still's native North Dakota.<ref>Breslin, pp. 223\u2013228.</ref> In 1947, during a summer semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art, Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum, and they realized this idea in New York in the following year. Named \"The Subjects of the Artists School\", they employed [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]] and [[Robert Motherwell]], among others.<ref>Breslin, p. 223.</ref> Though the group separated later in the same year, the school was the center of a flurry of activity in contemporary art. In addition to his teaching experience, Rothko began to contribute articles to two new art publications, ''Tiger's Eye'' and ''Possibilities''. Using the forums as an opportunity to assess the current art scene, Rothko also discussed in detail his own work and philosophy of art. These articles reflect the elimination of figurative elements from his painting, and a specific interest in the new [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] debate launched by [[Wolfgang Paalen]]'s ''Form and Sense'' publication of 1945.<ref>Robert Motherwell published Paalen's collected essays on art from his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', as the first number of the series. The number entitled ''Possibilities'', in which Rothko's statement was published, was the second of this series. ''Form and Sense'' was re-published in 2013 by Deborah Rosenthal, with a foreword by [[Martica Sawin]]. Wolfgang Paalen, ''Form and Sense, Meanings and Movements in Twentieth-Century Art'', New York (Arcade Publishing/Artists and Art) 2013</ref> Rothko described his new method as \"unknown adventures in an unknown space\", free from \"direct association with any particular, and the passion of organism\". Breslin described this change of attitude as \"both self and painting are now fields of possibilities \u2013 an effect conveyed ... by the creation of protean, indeterminate shapes whose multiplicity is let be.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 378</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Rothko became fascinated by [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Red Studio'', acquired by the Museum of Modern Art that year. He later credited it as another key source of inspiration for his later abstract paintings.<ref name=\"Breslin, p. 283\">Breslin, p. 283 and Ashton, pp. 61, 112.</ref>\n\n==Late period==\n[[File:'Magenta, Black, Green on Orange', oil on canvas painting by Mark Rothko, 1947, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|''No. 3/No. 13 (Magenta, Black, Green on Orange)'', 1949, 85 3/8\" \u00d7 65\" (216.5 \u00d7 164.8 cm), oil on canvas, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\nSoon, the \"multiforms\" developed into the signature style; by early 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. For critic [[Harold Rosenberg]], the paintings were nothing short of a revelation. After painting his first \"multiform\", Rothko had secluded himself to his home in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] on Long Island. He invited only a select few, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings. The discovery of his definitive form came at a period of great distress to the artist; his mother Kate had died in October 1948. Rothko happened upon the use of symmetrical rectangular blocks of two to three opposing or contrasting, yet complementary, colors, in which, for example, \"the rectangles sometimes seem barely to coalesce out of the ground, concentrations of its substance. The green bar in ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange'', on the other hand, appears to vibrate against the orange around it, creating an optical flicker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79687 |title=The Collection &#124; Mark Rothko. No. 3/No. 13. 1949 |publisher=MoMA |date=2004 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> Additionally, for the next seven years, Rothko painted in oil only on large canvases with vertical formats. Very large-scale designs were used in order to overwhelm the viewer, or, in Rothko's words, to make the viewer feel \"enveloped within\" the painting. For some critics, the large size was an attempt to make up for a lack of substance. In retaliation, Rothko stated:\n\n{{quote|I realize that historically the function of painting large pictures is painting something very grandiose and pompous. The reason I paint them, however ... is precisely because I want to be very intimate and human. To paint a small picture is to place yourself outside your experience, to look upon an experience as a stereopticon view or with a reducing glass. However you paint the larger picture, you are in it. It isn't something you command!}}\n\nHe even went so far as to recommend that viewers position themselves as little as eighteen inches away from the canvas<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Jeffrey|title=Mark Rothko|url=https://archive.org/details/markrothko00weis|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08193-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/markrothko00weis/page/262 262]}}</ref> so that they might experience a sense of intimacy, as well as awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown.\n\nAs Rothko achieved success, he became increasingly protective of his works, turning down several potentially important sales and exhibition opportunities:\n\n{{quote|A picture lives by companionship, expanding and quickening in the eyes of the sensitive observer. It dies by the same token. It is therefore a risky and unfeeling act to send it out into the world. How often it must be permanently impaired by the eyes of the vulgar and the cruelty of the impotent who would extend the affliction universally!<ref>Barbara Hess, ''Abstract Expressionism'' (New York: Taschen, 2005), p. 42.</ref>}}\n\nRothko's aims, in the estimation of some critics and viewers, exceeded his methods.<ref>[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''[[American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America]]'' (New York: Knopf, 1997) writes admiringly of Rothko's emotional range, \"from foreboding and sadness to an exquisite and joyful luminosity\", but takes issue with the artist's religious aspirations: \"Rothko's work could not, in the end, support the weight of meaning he wanted it to have\" (pp. 490\u2013491). Others, like [[Dore Ashton]], would profoundly disagree.</ref> Many of the [[abstract expressionist]]s discussed their art as aiming toward a spiritual experience, or at least an experience that exceeded the boundaries of the purely aesthetic. In later years, Rothko emphasized more emphatically the spiritual aspect of his artwork, a sentiment that would culminate in the construction of the [[Rothko Chapel]].<ref>For Hughes, the chapel in Texas offers the final proof that the artist has overreached himself: \"the eye ... seeks its nuances. But the expected epiphany does not come\" (p. 491).</ref>\n\nMany of the \"multiforms\" and early signature paintings are composed of bright, vibrant colors, particularly reds and yellows, expressing energy and ecstasy. By the mid-1950s, however, close to a decade after the completion of the first \"multiforms,\" Rothko began to employ dark blues and greens; for many critics of his work this shift in colors was representative of a growing darkness within Rothko's personal life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartonlinegallery.com/art-appreciation/mark-rothko-into-the-darkness-2/|title=Mark Rothko : Into The Darkness {{!}} Blog {{!}} Rippingham Art|last=byDavid|first=Written|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nRothko's method was to apply a thin layer of binder mixed with pigment directly onto uncoated and untreated canvas and to paint significantly thinned oils directly onto this layer, creating a dense mixture of overlapping colors and shapes. His brushstrokes were fast and light, a method he would continue to use until his death.<ref>Breslin, pp. 316\u2013317.</ref> His increasing adeptness at this method is apparent in the paintings completed for the Chapel. With an absence of figurative representation, what drama there is to be found in a late Rothko is in the contrast of colors, radiating against one another. His paintings can then be likened to a sort of fugue-like arrangement: each variation counterpoised against one another, yet all existing within one architectonic structure.\n\nRothko used several original techniques that he tried to keep secret even from his assistants. [[Electron microscopy]] and [[ultraviolet]] analysis conducted by the MOLAB showed that he employed natural substances such as egg and glue, as well as artificial materials including [[acrylic resin]]s, [[phenol formaldehyde]], modified [[alkyd]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rothko's methods revealed |first=Jane |last=Qiu |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7221 |page=447 |date=27 November 2008 |doi=10.1038/456447a |doi-access=free }}</ref> One of his objectives was to make the various layers of the painting dry quickly, without mixing of colors, so that he could soon create new layers on top of the earlier ones.\n\n===European travels: increasing fame===\nRothko and his wife visited Europe for five months in early 1950.<ref name=\"Breslin, p. 283\"/> The last time he had been in Europe was during his childhood in Latvia, at that time part of Russia. Yet he did not return to his homeland, preferring to visit the important painting collections in the major museums of England, France and Italy. The [[fresco]]es of [[Fra Angelico]] in the monastery of [[San Marco, Florence]], most impressed him. Fra Angelico's spirituality and concentration on light appealed to Rothko's sensibilities, as did the economic adversities the artist faced, which Rothko saw as similar to his own.<ref>Breslin, p. 285.</ref>\n\nRothko had one-man shows at the [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery in 1950 and 1951 and at other galleries across the world, including in Japan, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Amsterdam]]. The 1952 \"Fifteen Americans\" show curated by [[Dorothy Canning Miller]] at the Museum of Modern Art formally heralded the abstract artists and included works by [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[William Baziotes]].<ref>Breslin, p. 299 and Ashton, p. 130. Ashton writes that Rothko and Still refused to allow their works to travel to Europe, forcing Miller to cancel the traveling exhibition; his distaste for group shows only increased over time.</ref> It also created a dispute between Rothko and Barnett Newman, after Newman accused Rothko of having attempted to exclude him from the show. Growing success as a group was leading to infighting and claims to supremacy and leadership.<ref>Breslin, p. 345.</ref> When ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named a Rothko painting in 1955 as a good investment,<ref>Anna Chave, Mark Rothko, ''Mark Rothko: Subjects in Abstraction,'' p. 17</ref> Newman and Clyfford Still branded him a sell-out with bourgeois aspirations. Still wrote to Rothko to ask that the paintings he had given him over the years be returned. Rothko was deeply depressed by his former friends' jealousy.\n\nDuring the 1950 Europe trip, Rothko's wife became pregnant. On December 30, when they were back in New York, she gave birth to a daughter, Kathy Lynn, called \"Kate\" in honor of Rothko's mother.<ref>Breslin, p. 286.</ref>\n\n===Reactions to his own success===\nShortly thereafter, due to the ''Fortune'' magazine plug and further purchases by clients, Rothko's financial situation began to improve. In addition to sales of paintings, he also had money from his teaching position at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 1954, he exhibited in a solo show at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where he met art dealer [[Sidney Janis]], who represented Pollock and [[Franz Kline]]. Their relationship proved mutually beneficial.<ref>Breslin, pp. 297\u2013298.</ref>\n\nDespite his fame, Rothko felt a growing personal seclusion and a sense of being misunderstood as an artist. He feared that people purchased his paintings simply out of fashion and that the true purpose of his work was not being grasped by collectors, critics, or audiences. He wanted his paintings to move beyond abstraction, as well as beyond classical art. For Rothko, the paintings were objects that possessed their own form and potential, and therefore, must be encountered as such. Sensing the futility of words in describing this decidedly non-verbal aspect of his work, Rothko abandoned all attempts at responding to those who inquired after its meaning and purpose, stating finally that silence is \"so accurate\". \"My paintings' surfaces are expansive and push outward in all directions, or their surfaces contract and rush inward in all directions. Between these two poles, you can find everything I want to say.\"\n\nRothko began to insist that he was not an [[abstractionist]] and that such a description was as inaccurate as labeling him a great colorist. His interest was:\n\n{{quote|... only in expressing basic human emotions\u2014tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on. And the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I can communicate those basic human emotions ... The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationship, then you miss the point.<ref>Baal-Teshuva, p. 50.</ref>}}\n\nFor Rothko, color is \"merely an instrument\". The multiforms and the signature paintings are, in essence, the same expression of basic human emotions as his surrealistic mythological paintings, albeit in a purer form. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for \"tragedy, ecstasy and doom\". It was Rothko's comment on viewers breaking down in tears before his paintings that may have convinced the [[Dominique de Menil|de Menils]] to construct the Rothko Chapel. Whatever Rothko's feeling about interpretations of his work, it is apparent that, by 1958, the spiritual expression he meant to portray on canvas was growing increasingly dark. His bright reds, yellows and oranges were subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks.<ref>Breslin, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nRothko's friend, the art critic [[Dore Ashton]], points to the artist's acquaintance with poet Stanley Kunitz as a significant bond in this period (\"conversations between painter and poet fed into Rothko's enterprise\"). Kunitz saw Rothko as \"a primitive, a shaman who finds the magic formula and leads people to it\". Great poetry and painting, Kunitz believed, both had \"roots in magic, incantation, and spell-casting\" and were, at their core, ethical and spiritual. Kunitz instinctively understood the purpose of Rothko's quest.<ref>Ashton, pp. 150\u2013151.</ref>\n\nIn November 1958, Rothko gave an address to the [[Pratt Institute]]. In a tenor unusual for him, he discussed art as a trade and offered the \"recipe of a work of art\u2014its ingredients\u2014how to make it\u2014the formula.\n\n# There must be a clear preoccupation with death\u2014intimations of mortality ... Tragic art, romantic art, etc., deals with the knowledge of death.\n# Sensuality. Our basis of being concrete about the world. It is a lustful relationship to things that exist.\n# Tension. Either conflict or curbed desire.\n# Irony, This is a modern ingredient\u2014the self-effacement and examination by which a man for an instant can go on to something else.\n# Wit and play ... for the human element.\n# The ephemeral and chance ... for the human element.\n# Hope. 10% to make the tragic concept more endurable.\n\nI measure these ingredients very carefully when I paint a picture. It is always the form that follows these elements and the picture results from the proportions of these elements.\"<ref>Achim Borchardt-Hume (ed.). ''Rothko'' (London: Tate Gallery, 2008), p. 91</ref>\n\n===Seagram Murals\u2013Four Seasons restaurant commission===\n{{anchor|Seagram}}In 1958, Rothko was awarded the first of two major mural commissions, which proved both rewarding and frustrating.<ref>Breslin, pp. 371\u2013383, 404\u2013409, is a thorough account of this important episode in Rothko's career.</ref> The beverage company [[Seagram|Joseph Seagram and Sons]] had recently completed the new [[Seagram Building]] skyscraper on [[Park Avenue]], designed by architects [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Philip Johnson]]. Rothko agreed to provide paintings for the building's new luxury restaurant, [[The Four Seasons Restaurant|the Four Seasons]]. This was, as art historian [[Simon Schama]] put it, \"bring[ing] his monumental dramas right into the belly of the beast\".<ref>Schama, p. 398.</ref>\n\nFor Rothko, this commission presented a new challenge, since it was the first time he was required not only to design a coordinated series of paintings, but to produce an artwork space concept for a large, specific interior. Over the following three months, Rothko completed forty paintings, comprising three full series in dark red and brown. He altered his horizontal format to vertical, to complement the restaurant's vertical features: columns, walls, doors and windows.\n\nThe following June, Rothko and his family again traveled to Europe. While on the [[SS Independence|SS ''Independence'']] he disclosed to journalist John Fischer, who was publisher of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', that his true intention for the Seagram murals was to paint \"something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room\". He hoped, he told Fischer, that his painting would make the restaurant's patrons \"feel that they are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up, so that all they can do is butt their heads forever against the wall\".<ref>Breslin, p. 376.</ref>\n\n[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|Vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]\n[[File:Villa dei Misteri (Pompei) WLM 025.JPG|thumb|Frescoes in the Villa of the Mysteries]]\nWhile in Europe, the Rothkos traveled to Rome, Florence, Venice and Pompeii. In Florence, he visited [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Laurentian Library]], to see first-hand the library's vestibule, from which he drew further inspiration for the murals.<ref>Ashton, p. 147.</ref> He remarked that \"the room had exactly the feeling that I wanted ... it gives the visitor the feeling of being caught in a room with the doors and windows walled-in shut.\" He was further influenced by the somber colors of the murals in the Pompeiian [[Villa of the Mysteries]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Feeding fury|author=Jonathan Jones|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 December 2002|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/07/artsfeatures}}</ref> Following the trip to Italy, the Rothkos voyaged to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam, before returning to the United States.\n\nOnce back in New York, Rothko and wife Mell visited the nearly-completed Four Seasons restaurant. Upset with the restaurant's dining atmosphere, which he considered pretentious and inappropriate for the display of his works, Rothko refused to continue the project, and returned his cash advance to the Seagram and Sons Company. Seagram had intended to honor Rothko's emergence to prominence through his selection, and his breach of contract and public expression of outrage were unexpected.\n\nRothko kept the commissioned paintings in storage until 1968. Given that Rothko had known in advance about the luxury decor of the restaurant, and the social class of its future patrons, the motives for his abrupt repudiation remain mysterious. A temperamental personality, Rothko never fully explained his conflicted emotions over the incident.<ref>Schama, pp. 428\u2013434.</ref> One reading is offered by his biographer, James E.B. Breslin: the Seagram project could be seen as an acting-out of a familiar, in this case self-created \"drama of trust and betrayal, of advancing into the world, then withdrawing, angrily, from it ... He was an Isaac who at the last moment refused to yield to Abraham.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 408.</ref> The final series of ''Seagram Murals'' was dispersed, and now hangs in three locations: London's [[Tate Modern]] in its own Mark Rothko room, Japan's [[Kawamura Memorial Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/display/mark-rothko |title=Tate Modern, Rothko Murals |publisher=Tate.org.uk |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> This episode was the main basis for [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]'s 2009 play ''[[Red (play)|Red]]''.\n\nIn October 2012, ''[[Black on Maroon]]'', one of the paintings in the Seagram series, was defaced with writing in black ink, while on display at Tate Modern. Restoration of the painting took eighteen months to complete. The [[BBC]]'s Arts Editor [[Will Gompertz]] explained that the ink from the vandal's marker pen had bled all the way through the canvas, causing \"a deep wound, not a superficial graze\", and that the vandal had caused \"significant damage\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/13/tate-modern-unveils-restored-mark-rothko-black-on-maroon |title=Tate Modern unveils painstakingly restored Rothko|date=13 May 2014|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Rising American prominence===\nRothko's first completed space was created in the [[Phillips Collection]] in Washington, D.C., following the purchase of four paintings by collector [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]]. Rothko's fame and wealth had substantially increased; his paintings began to sell to notable collectors, including the [[Rockefeller family]]. In January 1961, Rothko sat next to [[Joseph Kennedy]] at [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inaugural ball. Later that year, a retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, to considerable commercial and critical success. In spite of this newfound fame, the art world had already turned its attention from the now pass\u00e9 abstract expressionists to the \"next big thing\", [[pop art]], particularly the work of [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein|Lichtenstein]], and [[James Rosenquist|Rosenquist]].\n\nRothko labeled pop-art artists \"charlatans and young opportunists\", and wondered aloud during a 1962 exhibition of pop art, \"Are the young artists plotting to kill us all?\" On viewing [[Jasper Johns]]'s flags, Rothko said, \"We worked for years to get rid of all that.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 427.</ref> It was not that Rothko could not accept being replaced, but that he could not accept what was replacing him: he found pop art vapid.\n\nOn August 31, 1963, Mell gave birth to a second child, Christopher.<ref>Breslin, p. 431.</ref> That autumn, Rothko signed with the [[Marlborough Gallery]] for sales of his work outside the United States. In New York, he continued to sell the artwork directly from his studio.<ref>Breslin, p. 443.</ref> Bernard Reis, Rothko's financial advisor, was also, unbeknownst to the artist, the gallery's accountant and, together with his co-workers, was later responsible for one of art history's largest scandals.\n\n===Harvard Murals===\nRothko received a second mural commission project, this time for a room of paintings for the penthouse of Harvard University's [[Holyoke Center]]. He made twenty-two sketches, from which ten wall-sized paintings on canvas were painted, six were brought to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and only five were hung: a triptych on one wall and opposite two individual panels. His aim was to create an environment for a public place. Harvard President [[Nathan Pusey]], following an explanation of the religious symbology of the [[Triptych]], had the paintings hung in January 1963, and later shown at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]]. During installation, Rothko found the paintings to be compromised by the room's lighting. Despite the installation of fiberglass shades, the paintings were all removed by 1979 and, due to the fugitive nature of some of the red pigments, in particular lithol red, were placed in dark storage and displayed only periodically.<ref>Breslin, pp. 445\u2013457.</ref> The murals were on display from November 16, 2014, to July 26, 2015, in the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, for which the fading of the pigments has been compensated by using an innovative color projection system to illuminate the paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artery.wbur.org/2014/05/20/harvard-rothkos |title=Harvard's Famously Damaged Rothko Paintings 'Restored' With Light |publisher=The ARTery |date=20 May 2014 |first=Andrea |last=Shea |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2014/05/20/harvard-rothko-murals-seen-new-light-with-revolutionary-new-projection-system/UspSbL0csFjeM2cwSflKON/story.html |title=Harvard's Rothko murals to be seen in new light with revolutionary new projection system |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Raskar, R., Cuellar, S., Mohan, A. and Gschwind, R., \u2018Conservation of a room: a treatment proposal for Mark Rothko\u2019s Harvard Murals,\u2019 Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 348-361</ref><ref>Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Wilker, A., Kallsen, K., Kirby, D.P. and Eremin, K., \u2018The making of Mark Rothko\u2019s Harvard Murals,\u2019 Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 331-347.</ref>\n\n===Rothko Chapel===\n[[File:Rothko Chapel 2007-03-13.jpg|left|thumb|Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas]]\nThe [[Rothko Chapel]] is located adjacent to the [[Menil Collection]] and [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|The University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]], Texas. The building is small and windowless. It is a geometric, \"postmodern\" structure, located in a turn-of-the-century middle-class Houston neighborhood. The Chapel, the Menil Collection, and the nearby [[Cy Twombly]] gallery were funded by Texas oil millionaires [[Dominique de Menil|John and Dominique de Menil]].\n[[File:153 East 69th Street.jpg|thumb|Rothko's studio on 153 East 69th Street in New York's Upper East Side]]\nIn 1964, Rothko moved into his last New York studio at 157 East 69th Street, equipping the studio with pulleys carrying large walls of canvas material to regulate light from a central cupola, to simulate lighting he planned for the Rothko Chapel. Despite warnings about the difference in light between New York and Texas, Rothko persisted with the experiment, setting to work on the canvases. Rothko told friends he intended the chapel to be his single most important artistic statement. He became considerably involved in the layout of the building, insisting that it feature a central cupola like that of his studio. Architect [[Philip Johnson]], unable to compromise with Rothko's vision about the kind of light he wanted in the space, left the project in 1967, and was replaced with [[Howard Barnstone]] and Eugene Aubry.<ref>Ashton, p. 183. Johnson would always maintain, and Ashton acknowledges that he was probably right, that he (Johnson) knew better than Rothko what lighting would best work in the chapel.</ref> The architects frequently flew to New York to consult and on one occasion brought with them a miniature of the building for Rothko's approval.\n\nFor Rothko, the chapel was to be a destination, a place of pilgrimage far from the center of art (in this case, New York) where seekers of Rothko's newly \"religious\" artwork could journey. Initially, the chapel, now non-denominational, was to be specifically [[Roman Catholic]], and during the first three years of the project (1964\u201367) Rothko believed it would remain so. Thus, Rothko's design of the building and the religious implications of the paintings were inspired by Roman Catholic art and architecture. Its octagonal shape is based on a [[Byzantine]] church of St. Maria Assunta, and the format of the triptychs is based on paintings of the [[Crucifixion]]. The de Menils believed the universal \"spiritual\" aspect of Rothko's work would complement the elements of Roman Catholicism.\n\nRothko's painting technique required considerable physical stamina that the ailing artist was no longer able to muster. To create the paintings he envisioned, Rothko was forced to hire two assistants, to apply the chestnut-brown paint in quick strokes of several layers: \"brick reds, deep reds, black mauves\". On half of the works, Rothko applied none of the paint himself, and was for the most part content to supervise the slow, arduous process. He felt the completion of the paintings to be \"torment\", and the inevitable result was to create \"something you don't want to look at\".\n\nThe chapel is the culmination of six years of Rothko's life, and represents his gradually growing concern for the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]]. For some, to witness these paintings is to submit one's self to a spiritual experience, which, through its transcendence of subject matter, approximates that of consciousness itself. It forces one to approach the limits of experience, and awakens one to the awareness of one's own existence. For others, the chapel houses fourteen large paintings whose dark, nearly impenetrable surfaces represent hermeticism and contemplation.\n\nThe chapel paintings consist of a monochrome triptych in soft brown, on the central wall, comprising three 5-by-15-foot panels, and a pair of triptychs on the left and right, made of opaque black rectangles. Between the triptychs are four individual paintings, measuring 11-by-15 feet each. One additional individual painting faces the central triptych, from the opposite wall. The effect is to surround the viewer with massive, imposing visions of darkness. Despite its basis in religious symbolism (the triptych) and less-than-subtle imagery (the crucifixion), the paintings are difficult to attach specifically to traditional Christian motifs, and may act on the viewers subliminally. Active spiritual or aesthetic inquiry may be elicited from the viewer, in the same way a religious icon with specific symbolism does. In this way, Rothko's erasure of symbols both removes and creates barriers to the work.\n\nAs it turned out, these works would be his final artistic statement to the world. They were finally unveiled at the chapel's opening in 1971. Rothko never saw the completed chapel, and never installed the paintings. On February 28, 1971, at the dedication, Dominique de Menil said, \"We are cluttered with images and only abstract art can bring us to the threshold of the divine\", noting Rothko's courage in painting what might be called \"impenetrable fortresses\" of color. The drama for many critics of Rothko's work is the uneasy position of the paintings between, as Chase notes, \"nothingness or vapidity\" and \"dignified 'mute icons' offering 'the only kind of beauty we find acceptable today'\".\n\n==Suicide and estate lawsuit==\n[[File:RothkoBlackGray.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Untitled (Black on Grey)]]'', 1970]]\nIn early 1968, Rothko was diagnosed with a mild aortic aneurysm. Ignoring doctor's orders, Rothko continued to drink and smoke heavily, avoided exercise, and maintained an unhealthy diet. \"Highly nervous, thin, restless\", was his friend [[Dore Ashton]]'s description of Rothko at this time.<ref>Ashton, p. 188.</ref> However, he did follow the medical advice given not to paint pictures larger than a yard in height, and turned his attention to smaller, less physically strenuous formats, including acrylics on paper. Meanwhile, Rothko's marriage had become increasingly troubled, and his poor health and impotence resulting from the aneurysm compounded his feeling of estrangement in the relationship.<ref>Breslin, p. 490</ref> Rothko and his wife Mell (1921\u20131970) separated on New Year's Day 1969, and he moved into his studio.\n\nOn February 25, 1970, Oliver Steindecker, Rothko's assistant, found the artist in his kitchen, lying dead on the floor in front of the sink, covered in blood. He overdosed on [[barbiturates]], and cut an artery in his right arm with a razor blade.<ref name=\"sui\">{{cite news |last=Cooke |first=Rachel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/14/art1 |title=The art cheats who betrayed my father |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2018-03-17 }}</ref> There was no suicide note.

Reis later sold the paintings to the [[Marlborough Gallery]], at substantially reduced values, and then split the profits from sales with Gallery representatives. In 1971, Rothko's children filed a lawsuit against Reis, Morton Levine, and [[Theodoros Stamos|Theodore Stamos]], the executors of his estate, over the sham sales. The lawsuit continued for more than 10 years, and became known as the [[Rothko Case]]. In 1975, the defendants were found liable for negligence and conflict of interest, were removed as executors of the Rothko estate by court order, and, along with Marlborough Gallery, were required to pay a $9.2 million damages judgment to the estate. This amount represents only a small fraction of the eventual vast financial value, since achieved, by numerous Rothko works produced in his lifetime.<ref>(case cite 372 N.E.2d 291)</ref>\n\nRothko's separated wife Mell, also a heavy drinker, died six months after him at the age of 48.

Although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any art movement, he is generally identified as an [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]].\n\n==Childhood==\nMark Rothko was born in [[Daugavpils]], Latvia (then in Russian Empire). His father, Jacob (Yakov) Rothkowitz, was a [[pharmacist]] and an intellectual who initially provided his children with a secular and political, rather than religious, upbringing. According to Rothko, his [[Marxist schools of thought|pro-Marxist]] father was \"violently anti-religious\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-newish-biography-of-mark-rothko/#!|title=A Newish Biography of Mark Rothko|last=Glueck|first=Grace|date=11 October 2016|work=|newspaper=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2016-10-22|via=}}</ref> In an environment where Jews were often blamed for many of the evils that befell Russia, Rothko's early childhood was plagued by fear.<ref>Biographical information for this entry is taken from {{harvnb|Breslin|1993}} and {{harvnb|Ashton|1983}}.</ref>\n\nDespite Jacob Rothkowitz's modest income, the family was highly educated (\"We were a reading family\", Rothko's sister recalled),<ref>Breslin, p. 14.</ref> and Rothko was able to speak Lithuanian [[Yiddish]] ([[Yiddish dialects|Litvish]]), Hebrew and Russian.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Following his father's return to the [[Orthodox Judaism]] of his own youth, Rothko, the youngest of four siblings, was sent to the [[cheder]] at the age of five, where he studied the [[Talmud]], although his elder siblings had been educated in the public school system.<ref>Breslin, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n==Emigration from Russia to the U.S.==\nFearing that his elder sons were about to be drafted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]], Jacob Rothkowitz emigrated from Russia to the United States. Markus remained in Russia, with his mother and elder sister Sonia. They arrived as immigrants, at [[Ellis Island]], in late 1913. From that point, they crossed the country, to join Jacob and the elder brothers, in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Jacob's death, a few months later, from [[colon cancer]],<ref name=\":0\" /> left the family without economic support. Sonia operated a cash register, while Markus worked in one of his uncle's warehouses, selling newspapers to employees.<ref>Breslin, pp. 21\u201322, 24, 32.</ref> His father's death also led Rothko to sever his ties with religion. After he had mourned his father's death for almost a year at a local synagogue, he vowed never to set foot in it again.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRothko started school in the United States in 1913, quickly accelerating from third to fifth grade. In June 1921, he completed the secondary level, with honors, at [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], at the age of seventeen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/rothko_mark_1903_1970_/#.XjsijyMwj-k|title=Mark Rothko {{!}} The Oregon Encyclopedia|website=www.oregonencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\nHe learned his fourth language, English, and became an active member of the Jewish community center, where he proved adept at political discussions. Like his father, Rothko was passionate about issues such as workers' rights, and women's right to contraception.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} At the time, Portland was a center of revolutionary activity in the U.S. and the region where the revolutionary syndicalist union [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) was strongest.\n\nRothko, having grown up around radical workers' meetings, attended meetings of the IWW, including [[Anarchism|anarchists]] such as [[Bill Haywood]] and [[Emma Goldman]], where he developed strong oratorical skills he would later use in defense of [[Surrealism]]. He heard [[Emma Goldman]] speak on one of her West Coast activist lecture tours.<ref>Breslin, pp. 34\u201335.</ref> With the onset of the [[Russian Revolution]], Rothko organized debates about it. Despite the repressive political atmosphere, he wished to become a labor [[union organizer]].\n\nRothko received a scholarship to [[Yale University|Yale]]. At the end of his freshman year in 1922, the scholarship was not renewed, and he worked as a waiter and delivery boy to support his studies. He found the Yale community to be [[elitist]] and [[racist]]. Rothko and a friend, [[Aaron Director]], started a satirical magazine, ''The Yale Saturday Evening Pest'', which lampooned the school's stuffy, [[bourgeois]] tone.<ref>Stigler, Stephen M., \"Aaron Director Remembered\". 48 J. Law and Econ. 307, 2005.</ref> Rothko's nature was more that of a [[self-taught]] man than a diligent pupil: \"One of his fellow students remembers that he hardly seemed to study, but that he was a voracious reader.\"<ref>Ashton, p. 10.</ref> At the end of his sophomore year, Rothko dropped out, and did not return until he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], forty-six years later.<ref>Breslin, pp. 47\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nIn the autumn of 1923, Rothko found work in [[Garment District, Manhattan|New York's garment district]]. While visiting a friend at the [[Art Students League of New York]], he saw students sketching a model. According to Rothko, this was the beginning of his life as an artist.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  He later enrolled in the [[Parsons The New School for Design]], where one of his instructors was [[Arshile Gorky]]. Rothko characterized Gorky's leadership of the class as \"overcharged with supervision.\"<ref>Hayden Herrera, ''Arshile Gorky: His Life and Work'' (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 2003), pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> That same autumn, he took courses at the Art Students League taught by Cubist artist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], a fellow [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jew]] who had been a part of the French avant-garde movement. To his students eager to know about [[Modernism]], Weber was seen as \"a living repository of modern art history\".<ref>Ashton, p. 11.</ref> Under Weber's tutelage, Rothko began to view art as a tool of emotional and religious expression. Rothko's paintings from this era reveal the influence of his instructor.<ref>Breslin, pp. 62\u201363. Ashton, an art historian and close friend of Rothko's, goes further: \"Weber presided over [Rothko's] early development\" (p. 19).</ref> Years later, when Weber attended a show of his former student's work and expressed his admiration, Rothko was immensely pleased.<ref>Ashton, p. 69.</ref>\n\n===Rothko's circle===\nRothko's move to New York landed him in a fertile artistic atmosphere. Modernist painters were having more shows in New York galleries all the time, and the city's museums were an invaluable resource for a budding artist's knowledge and skills. Among the important early influences on him were the works of the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]], the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] art of [[Paul Klee]], and the paintings of [[Georges Rouault]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1928, with a group of other young artists, Rothko exhibited works at the Opportunity Gallery.<ref name=\"AAA\" /> His paintings, including dark, moody, expressionist interiors and urban scenes, were generally well accepted among critics and peers. To supplement his income, in 1929 Rothko began instructing schoolchildren in drawing, painting and clay sculpture at the Center Academy of the Brooklyn Jewish Center, where he would remain active in teaching at that location for twenty-two years, until 1952.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Rothko met [[Adolph Gottlieb]], who, along with [[Barnett Newman]], [[Joseph Solman]], [[Louis Schanker]], and [[John D. Graham|John Graham]], was part of a group of young artists surrounding the painter [[Milton Avery]]. According to [[Elaine de Kooning]], it was Avery who \"gave Rothko the idea that [the life of a professional artist] was a possibility.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 91</ref> Avery's abstract nature paintings, utilizing a rich knowledge of form and color, had a tremendous influence on him.<ref name=\"AAA\">{{cite web | author=| year=2011 | title=Oral history interview with Sally Avery, 1982 Feb. 19 | work=Oral history interviews | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-sally-avery-12685 | accessdate=18 Jun 2011}}</ref> Soon, Rothko's paintings took on subject matter and color similar to Avery's, as seen in ''Bathers, or Beach Scene'' of 1933\u20131934.<ref>On Avery's impact on Rothko: Ashton, pp. 21\u201325.</ref>\n\nRothko, Gottlieb, Newman, Solman, Graham, and their mentor, Avery, spent considerable time together, vacationing at [[Lake George, New York]], and [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. In the daytime they painted, then discussed art in the evenings. During a 1932 visit to Lake George, Rothko met Edith Sachar, a jewelry designer, whom he married later that year.<ref>Breslin, p. 81.</ref> The following summer, his first one-person show was held at the [[Portland Art Museum]], consisting mostly of drawings and [[aquarelle]]s. For this exhibition, Rothko took the very unusual step of displaying works done by his pre-adolescent students from the Center Academy, alongside his own.<ref>Ashton, p. 26. She writes: \"Child art, for Rothko, was a kind of touchstone, a barometer of truth.\"</ref> His family was unable to understand Rothko's decision to be an artist, especially considering the dire economic situation of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jahn |first=Jeff |url=http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2008/03/rothko_in_portl.html |title=PORT |publisher=Portlandart.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> Having suffered serious financial setbacks, the Rothkowitzes were mystified by Rothko's seeming indifference to financial necessity. They felt he was doing his mother a disservice by not finding a more lucrative and realistic career.<ref>Breslin, pp. 57, 89.</ref>\n\n===First solo show in New York===\nReturning to New York, Rothko had his first East Coast one-person show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery.<ref>Breslin, p. 87.</ref> He showed fifteen oil paintings, mostly portraits, along with some aquarelles and drawings. Among these works, the oil paintings especially captured the art critics' eyes. Rothko's use of rich fields of colors moved beyond Avery's influence. In late 1935, Rothko joined with [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], Ben-Zion, Adolph Gottlieb, Lou Harris, [[Ralph Rosenborg]], [[Louis Schanker]] and [[Joseph Solman]] to form \"[http://www.LouisSchanker.info/tendisc.htm The Ten]\" (Whitney Ten Dissenters). According to a gallery show catalog, the mission of the group was \"to protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting and literal painting.\"<ref>Breslin, pp. 101\u2013106.</ref>\n\nRothko was earning a growing reputation among his peers, particularly among the group that formed the Artists' Union.<ref>Ashton, pp. 30\u201332.</ref> The Artists' Union, including Gottlieb and Solman, hoped to create a municipal art gallery, to show self-organized group exhibitions. In 1936, the group exhibited at the Galerie Bonaparte in France, which resulted in some positive critical attention. One reviewer remarked that Rothko's paintings \"display authentic coloristic values.\"<ref>Ashton, 35.</ref> Later, in 1938, a show was held at the Mercury Gallery in New York, intended as a protest against the Whitney Museum of American Art, which the group regarded as having a provincial, regionalist agenda. Also during this period, Rothko, like Avery, Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, and many others, found employment with the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref>Breslin, p. 121.</ref>\n\n===Development of style===\nIn 1936, Rothko began writing a book, never completed, about similarities in the art of children and the work of modern painters.<ref>Breslin, pp. 130\u2013137.</ref> According to Rothko, the work of modernists, influenced by primitive art, could be compared to that of children in that \"child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a mimicry of himself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on art|last=Rothko|first=Mark|last2=L\u00f3pez-Remiro|first2=Miguel|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780300114409|location=New Haven|pages=[https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/8 8]|language=English|oclc=1008510353|url=https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/8}}</ref> In this manuscript, he observed: \"Tradition of starting with drawing in academic notion We may start with color.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on art|last=Rothko|first=Mark|last2=L\u00f3pez-Remiro|first2=Miguel|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300114409|location=New Haven|pages=[https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/6 6]|language=English|oclc=1008510353|url=https://archive.org/details/writingsonart0000roth/page/6}}</ref> Rothko was using fields of color in his aquarelles and city scenes. His style was already evolving in the direction of his renowned later works. Despite this newfound exploration of color, Rothko turned his attention to other formal and stylistic innovations, inaugurating a period of surrealist paintings influenced by mythological fables and symbols.\n\nRothko's work later matured from representation and mythological subjects into rectangular fields of color and light, culminating in his final works for the [[Rothko Chapel]]. Between his early style of primitivist and playful urban scenes, and his later style of transcendent color fields, was a long period of transition. This development was marked by two important events in Rothko's life: the onset of [[World War II]], and his reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Maturity==\n[[File:Consuelo Kanaga, Mark Rothko, Yorktown Heights, ca. 1949.jpg|thumb|right|''Mark Rothko, Yorktown Heights'', ca. 1949. [[Brooklyn Museum]], by [[Consuelo Kanaga]]]]\nRothko separated temporarily from his wife Edith in mid-1937. They reconciled several months later, but their relationship remained tense.<ref>Breslin, p. 144.</ref> On February 21, 1938, Rothko finally became a citizen of the United States, prompted by fears that the growing [[Nazi]] influence in Europe might provoke sudden deportation of American Jews. Concerned about [[anti-Semitism]] in America and Europe, Rothko in 1940 abbreviated his name from \"Markus Rothkowitz\" to \"Mark Rothko\". The name \"Roth\", a common abbreviation, was still identifiably Jewish, so he settled upon \"Rothko.\"<ref>Baal-Teshuva, p. 31.</ref><ref name=Haaretz>https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-this-day-mark-rothko-is-found-dead-1.5231350</ref>\n\n===Inspiration from mythology===\nFearing that modern American painting had reached a conceptual dead end, Rothko was intent upon exploring subjects other than urban and nature scenes. He sought subjects that would complement his growing interest with form, space, and color. The world crisis of war gave this search a sense of immediacy. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  He insisted that the new subject matter have a social impact, yet be able to transcend the confines of current political symbols and values. In his essay \"The [[Romantics]] Were Prompted,\" published in 1948, Rothko argued that the \"archaic artist ... found it necessary to create a group of intermediaries, monsters, hybrids, gods and demigods,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theoria.art-zoo.com/the-romantics-were-prompted-mark-rothko/|title=The Romantics Were Prompted,\" Mark Rothko, ''Possibilities'', No. 1, p. 84 {{!}} ''Possibilities'', No. 1, Winter 1947-48|website=www.theoria.art-zoo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> in much the same way that modern man found intermediaries in [[Fascism]] and the [[Communist Party]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  For Rothko, \"without monsters and gods, art cannot enact a drama\".<ref>Breslin, p. 240.</ref>\n\nRothko's use of [[mythology]] as a commentary on current history was not novel. Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman read and discussed the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mo.ma/2udiCWD|title=Jackson Pollock: Interviews, Articles, and Reviews.

They understood mythological symbols as images, operating in a space of human consciousness, which transcends specific history and culture.<ref>Ashton, pp. 40\u201350.</ref> Rothko later said that his artistic approach was \"reformed\" by his study of the \"dramatic themes of myth\". He allegedly stopped painting altogether in 1940, to immerse himself in reading [[James Frazer|Sir James Frazer's]] study of mythology ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', and Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.<ref>Breslin, p. 160.</ref>\n\n===Nietzsche's influence===\nRothko's new vision attempted to address modern man's spiritual and creative mythological requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/features/mark-rothko/mark-rothko-early-years.html|title=\"Mark Rothko: Early Years\" {{!}} National Gallery of Art|website=www.nga.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> The most crucial philosophical influence on Rothko in this period was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.<ref>Ashton, pp. 51\u201357.</ref> Nietzsche claimed that Greek tragedy served to redeem man from the terrors of mortal life. The exploration of novel topics in modern art ceased to be Rothko's goal. From this time on, his art had the goal of relieving modern man's spiritual emptiness. He believed that this emptiness resulted partly from lack of a mythology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} which, according to Nietzsche, \"The images of the myth have to be the unnoticed omnipresent demonic guardians, under whose care the young soul grows to maturity and whose signs help the man to interpret his life and struggles.\"<ref>Nietzsche 1872, \u00a723</ref> Rothko believed his art could free unconscious energies, previously bound by mythological images, symbols, and rituals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/myth-making-abstract-expressionist-painting-united-states|title=\"Myth-Making: Abstract Expressionist Painting From The United States {{!}} The Tate Gallery, 10 March 1992 \u2013 10 January 1993|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> He considered himself a \"mythmaker\", and proclaimed that \"the exhilarated tragic experience is for me the only source of art\".<ref>https://www.theartstory.org/artist/rothko-mark/</ref>\n\nMany of his paintings in this period contrast barbaric scenes of violence with civilized passivity, using imagery drawn primarily from [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Oresteia]]'' [[trilogy]]. A list of Rothko's paintings from this period illustrates his use of myth: ''[[Antigone]]'', ''[[Oedipus]]'', ''The Sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]]'', ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]'', ''[[Erinyes|The Furies]]'', ''Altar of [[Orpheus]]''. Rothko evokes Judeo-Christian imagery in ''Gethsemane'', ''[[The Last Supper]]'', and ''Rites of [[Lilith]]''. He also invokes  Egyptian (''Room in [[Karnak]]'') and Syrian (''The Syrian Bull'') myth. Soon after [[World War II]], Rothko believed his titles limited the larger, transcendent aims of his paintings. To allow maximum interpretation by the viewer, he stopped naming and framing his paintings, referring to them only by numbers.<ref>Wallace, Nora.

In 1936, Rothko attended two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], \"Cubism and Abstract Art\", and \"Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism\".<ref>Ashton, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn 1942, following the success of shows by [[Max Ernst|Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Yves Tanguy|Tanguy]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], artists who had immigrated to the United States because of the war, [[Surrealism]] took New York by storm.<ref>Breslin, p. 181.</ref> Rothko and his peers, [[Adolph Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] and [[Barnett Newman|Newman]], met and discussed the art and ideas of these European pioneers, as well as those of [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]. They began to regard themselves as heirs to the European avant-garde.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nNew paintings were unveiled at a 1942 show at [[Macy's]] department store in New York City. In response to a negative review by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rothko and Gottlieb issued a manifesto, written mainly by Rothko. Addressing the ''Times'' critic's self-professed \"befuddlement\" over the new work, they stated \"We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal. We wish to reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth.\" On a more strident note, they criticised those who wanted to live surrounded by less challenging art, noting that their work necessarily \"must insult anyone who is spiritually attuned to interior decoration\".<ref>Breslin, pp. 191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nRothko's viewed [[myth]] as a replenishing resource for an era of spiritual void. This belief had begun decades earlier, through his reading of [[Carl Jung]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Thomas Mann]], among other authors.<ref>Ashton, p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Break with Surrealism===\nOn June 13, 1943, Rothko and Sachar separated again.<ref>Breslin, p. 170.</ref> Rothko suffered a long depression following their divorce.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}   Thinking that a change of scenery might help, Rothko returned to Portland. From there, he traveled to Berkeley, where he met artist [[Clyfford Still]], and the two began a close friendship.<ref>Breslin, p. 205 and Ashton, pp. 92\u201393.</ref> Still's deeply abstract paintings would be of considerable influence on Rothko's later works. In the autumn of 1943, Rothko returned to New York. He met with noted collector and art dealer [[Peggy Guggenheim]], but she was initially reluctant to take on his artworks.<ref>Breslin, p. 208.</ref> Rothko's one-person show at Guggenheim's [[The Art of This Century Gallery]], in late 1945, resulted in few sales, with prices ranging from $150 to $750. The exhibit also attracted less-than-favorable reviews from critics. During this period, Rothko had been stimulated by Still's abstract landscapes of color, and his style shifted away from surrealism. Rothko's experiments in interpreting the unconscious symbolism of everyday forms had run their course. His future lay with abstraction:\n\n{{quote|I insist upon the equal existence of the world engendered in the mind and the world engendered by God outside of it. If I have faltered in the use of familiar objects, it is because I refuse to mutilate their appearance for the sake of an action which they are too old to serve, or for which perhaps they had never been intended. I quarrel with surrealists and abstract art only as one quarrels with his father and mother; recognizing the inevitability and function of my roots, but insistent upon my dissent; I, being both they, and an integral completely independent of them.<ref>Baal-Teshun, p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nRothko's 1945 masterpiece, ''Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea'', illustrates his newfound propensity towards abstraction. It has been interpreted as a meditation on Rothko's courtship of his second wife, Mary Ellen \"Mell\" Beistle, whom he met in 1944 and married in early 1945. Other readings have noted echoes of Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus'', which Rothko saw at an \"Italian Masters\" loan exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art, in 1940. The painting presents, in subtle grays and browns, two human-like forms embraced in a swirling, floating atmosphere of shapes and colors. The rigid rectangular background foreshadows Rothko's later experiments in pure color. The painting was completed, not coincidentally, in the year the [[Second World War]] ended.<ref>Breslin, pp. 212\u2013216.</ref>\n\nDespite the abandonment of his \"Mythomorphic Abstractionism\", Rothko would still be recognized by the public primarily for his surrealist works, for the remainder of the 1940s. The [[Whitney Museum]] included them in their annual exhibit of contemporary art from 1943 to 1950. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===\"Multiforms\"===\nThe year 1946 saw the creation of what art critics have termed Rothko's transitional \"multiform\" paintings. Rothko never used the term multiform himself, yet it is an accurate description of these paintings. Several of them, including ''No. 18'' and ''Untitled'' (both 1948), are less transitional than fully realized. Rothko himself described these paintings as possessing a more organic structure, and as self-contained units of human expression. For him, these blurred blocks of various colors, devoid of landscape or the human figure, let alone myth and symbol, possessed their own life force. They contained a \"breath of life\" he found lacking in most figurative painting of the era. They were filled with possibility, whereas his experimentation with mythological symbolism had become a tired formula. The \"multiforms\" brought Rothko to a realization of his mature, signature style, the only style Rothko would never fully abandon.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the middle of this crucial period of transition, Rothko had been impressed by [[Clyfford Still]]'s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still's native North Dakota.<ref>Breslin, pp. 223\u2013228.</ref> In 1947, during a summer semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art, Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum, and they realized this idea in New York in the following year. Named \"The Subjects of the Artists School\", they employed [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]] and [[Robert Motherwell]], among others.<ref>Breslin, p. 223.</ref> Though the group separated later in the same year, the school was the center of a flurry of activity in contemporary art. In addition to his teaching experience, Rothko began to contribute articles to two new art publications, ''Tiger's Eye'' and ''Possibilities''. Using the forums as an opportunity to assess the current art scene, Rothko also discussed in detail his own work and philosophy of art. These articles reflect the elimination of figurative elements from his painting, and a specific interest in the new [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] debate launched by [[Wolfgang Paalen]]'s ''Form and Sense'' publication of 1945.<ref>Robert Motherwell published Paalen's collected essays on art from his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', as the first number of the series. The number entitled ''Possibilities'', in which Rothko's statement was published, was the second of this series. ''Form and Sense'' was re-published in 2013 by Deborah Rosenthal, with a foreword by [[Martica Sawin]]. Wolfgang Paalen, ''Form and Sense, Meanings and Movements in Twentieth-Century Art'', New York (Arcade Publishing/Artists and Art) 2013</ref> Rothko described his new method as \"unknown adventures in an unknown space\", free from \"direct association with any particular, and the passion of organism\". Breslin described this change of attitude as \"both self and painting are now fields of possibilities \u2013 an effect conveyed ... by the creation of protean, indeterminate shapes whose multiplicity is let be.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 378</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Rothko became fascinated by [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Red Studio'', acquired by the Museum of Modern Art that year. He later credited it as another key source of inspiration for his later abstract paintings.<ref name=\"Breslin, p. 283\">Breslin, p. 283 and Ashton, pp. 61, 112.</ref>\n\n==Late period==\n[[File:'Magenta, Black, Green on Orange', oil on canvas painting by Mark Rothko, 1947, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|''No. 3/No. 13 (Magenta, Black, Green on Orange)'', 1949, 85 3/8\" \u00d7 65\" (216.5 \u00d7 164.8 cm), oil on canvas, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\nSoon, the \"multiforms\" developed into the signature style; by early 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. For critic [[Harold Rosenberg]], the paintings were nothing short of a revelation. After painting his first \"multiform\", Rothko had secluded himself to his home in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] on Long Island. He invited only a select few, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings. The discovery of his definitive form came at a period of great distress to the artist; his mother Kate had died in October 1948. Rothko happened upon the use of symmetrical rectangular blocks of two to three opposing or contrasting, yet complementary, colors, in which, for example, \"the rectangles sometimes seem barely to coalesce out of the ground, concentrations of its substance. The green bar in ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange'', on the other hand, appears to vibrate against the orange around it, creating an optical flicker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79687 |title=The Collection &#124; Mark Rothko. No. 3/No. 13. 1949 |publisher=MoMA |date=2004 |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> Additionally, for the next seven years, Rothko painted in oil only on large canvases with vertical formats. Very large-scale designs were used in order to overwhelm the viewer, or, in Rothko's words, to make the viewer feel \"enveloped within\" the painting. For some critics, the large size was an attempt to make up for a lack of substance. In retaliation, Rothko stated:\n\n{{quote|I realize that historically the function of painting large pictures is painting something very grandiose and pompous. The reason I paint them, however ... is precisely because I want to be very intimate and human. To paint a small picture is to place yourself outside your experience, to look upon an experience as a stereopticon view or with a reducing glass. However you paint the larger picture, you are in it. It isn't something you command!}}\n\nHe even went so far as to recommend that viewers position themselves as little as eighteen inches away from the canvas<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Jeffrey|title=Mark Rothko|url=https://archive.org/details/markrothko00weis|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08193-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/markrothko00weis/page/262 262]}}</ref> so that they might experience a sense of intimacy, as well as awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown.\n\nAs Rothko achieved success, he became increasingly protective of his works, turning down several potentially important sales and exhibition opportunities:\n\n{{quote|A picture lives by companionship, expanding and quickening in the eyes of the sensitive observer. It dies by the same token. It is therefore a risky and unfeeling act to send it out into the world. How often it must be permanently impaired by the eyes of the vulgar and the cruelty of the impotent who would extend the affliction universally!<ref>Barbara Hess, ''Abstract Expressionism'' (New York: Taschen, 2005), p. 42.</ref>}}\n\nRothko's aims, in the estimation of some critics and viewers, exceeded his methods.<ref>[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''[[American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America]]'' (New York: Knopf, 1997) writes admiringly of Rothko's emotional range, \"from foreboding and sadness to an exquisite and joyful luminosity\", but takes issue with the artist's religious aspirations: \"Rothko's work could not, in the end, support the weight of meaning he wanted it to have\" (pp. 490\u2013491). Others, like [[Dore Ashton]], would profoundly disagree.</ref> Many of the [[abstract expressionist]]s discussed their art as aiming toward a spiritual experience, or at least an experience that exceeded the boundaries of the purely aesthetic. In later years, Rothko emphasized more emphatically the spiritual aspect of his artwork, a sentiment that would culminate in the construction of the [[Rothko Chapel]].<ref>For Hughes, the chapel in Texas offers the final proof that the artist has overreached himself: \"the eye ... seeks its nuances. But the expected epiphany does not come\" (p. 491).</ref>\n\nMany of the \"multiforms\" and early signature paintings are composed of bright, vibrant colors, particularly reds and yellows, expressing energy and ecstasy. By the mid-1950s, however, close to a decade after the completion of the first \"multiforms,\" Rothko began to employ dark blues and greens; for many critics of his work this shift in colors was representative of a growing darkness within Rothko's personal life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartonlinegallery.com/art-appreciation/mark-rothko-into-the-darkness-2/|title=Mark Rothko : Into The Darkness {{!}} Blog {{!}} Rippingham Art|last=byDavid|first=Written|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nRothko's method was to apply a thin layer of binder mixed with pigment directly onto uncoated and untreated canvas and to paint significantly thinned oils directly onto this layer, creating a dense mixture of overlapping colors and shapes. His brushstrokes were fast and light, a method he would continue to use until his death.<ref>Breslin, pp. 316\u2013317.</ref> His increasing adeptness at this method is apparent in the paintings completed for the Chapel. With an absence of figurative representation, what drama there is to be found in a late Rothko is in the contrast of colors, radiating against one another. His paintings can then be likened to a sort of fugue-like arrangement: each variation counterpoised against one another, yet all existing within one architectonic structure.\n\nRothko used several original techniques that he tried to keep secret even from his assistants. [[Electron microscopy]] and [[ultraviolet]] analysis conducted by the MOLAB showed that he employed natural substances such as egg and glue, as well as artificial materials including [[acrylic resin]]s, [[phenol formaldehyde]], modified [[alkyd]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rothko's methods revealed |first=Jane |last=Qiu |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7221 |page=447 |date=27 November 2008 |doi=10.1038/456447a |doi-access=free }}</ref> One of his objectives was to make the various layers of the painting dry quickly, without mixing of colors, so that he could soon create new layers on top of the earlier ones.\n\n===European travels: increasing fame===\nRothko and his wife visited Europe for five months in early 1950.<ref name=\"Breslin, p. 283\"/> The last time he had been in Europe was during his childhood in Latvia, at that time part of Russia. Yet he did not return to his homeland, preferring to visit the important painting collections in the major museums of England, France and Italy. The [[fresco]]es of [[Fra Angelico]] in the monastery of [[San Marco, Florence]], most impressed him. Fra Angelico's spirituality and concentration on light appealed to Rothko's sensibilities, as did the economic adversities the artist faced, which Rothko saw as similar to his own.<ref>Breslin, p. 285.</ref>\n\nRothko had one-man shows at the [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery in 1950 and 1951 and at other galleries across the world, including in Japan, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Amsterdam]]. The 1952 \"Fifteen Americans\" show curated by [[Dorothy Canning Miller]] at the Museum of Modern Art formally heralded the abstract artists and included works by [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[William Baziotes]].<ref>Breslin, p. 299 and Ashton, p. 130. Ashton writes that Rothko and Still refused to allow their works to travel to Europe, forcing Miller to cancel the traveling exhibition; his distaste for group shows only increased over time.</ref> It also created a dispute between Rothko and Barnett Newman, after Newman accused Rothko of having attempted to exclude him from the show. Growing success as a group was leading to infighting and claims to supremacy and leadership.<ref>Breslin, p. 345.</ref> When ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named a Rothko painting in 1955 as a good investment,<ref>Anna Chave, Mark Rothko, ''Mark Rothko: Subjects in Abstraction,'' p. 17</ref> Newman and Clyfford Still branded him a sell-out with bourgeois aspirations. Still wrote to Rothko to ask that the paintings he had given him over the years be returned. Rothko was deeply depressed by his former friends' jealousy.\n\nDuring the 1950 Europe trip, Rothko's wife became pregnant. On December 30, when they were back in New York, she gave birth to a daughter, Kathy Lynn, called \"Kate\" in honor of Rothko's mother.<ref>Breslin, p. 286.</ref>\n\n===Reactions to his own success===\nShortly thereafter, due to the ''Fortune'' magazine plug and further purchases by clients, Rothko's financial situation began to improve. In addition to sales of paintings, he also had money from his teaching position at [[Brooklyn College]]. In 1954, he exhibited in a solo show at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where he met art dealer [[Sidney Janis]], who represented Pollock and [[Franz Kline]]. Their relationship proved mutually beneficial.<ref>Breslin, pp. 297\u2013298.</ref>\n\nDespite his fame, Rothko felt a growing personal seclusion and a sense of being misunderstood as an artist. He feared that people purchased his paintings simply out of fashion and that the true purpose of his work was not being grasped by collectors, critics, or audiences. He wanted his paintings to move beyond abstraction, as well as beyond classical art. For Rothko, the paintings were objects that possessed their own form and potential, and therefore, must be encountered as such. Sensing the futility of words in describing this decidedly non-verbal aspect of his work, Rothko abandoned all attempts at responding to those who inquired after its meaning and purpose, stating finally that silence is \"so accurate\". \"My paintings' surfaces are expansive and push outward in all directions, or their surfaces contract and rush inward in all directions. Between these two poles, you can find everything I want to say.\"\n\nRothko began to insist that he was not an [[abstractionist]] and that such a description was as inaccurate as labeling him a great colorist. His interest was:\n\n{{quote|... only in expressing basic human emotions\u2014tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on. And the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I can communicate those basic human emotions ... The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationship, then you miss the point.<ref>Baal-Teshuva, p. 50.</ref>}}\n\nFor Rothko, color is \"merely an instrument\". The multiforms and the signature paintings are, in essence, the same expression of basic human emotions as his surrealistic mythological paintings, albeit in a purer form. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for \"tragedy, ecstasy and doom\". It was Rothko's comment on viewers breaking down in tears before his paintings that may have convinced the [[Dominique de Menil|de Menils]] to construct the Rothko Chapel. Whatever Rothko's feeling about interpretations of his work, it is apparent that, by 1958, the spiritual expression he meant to portray on canvas was growing increasingly dark. His bright reds, yellows and oranges were subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks.<ref>Breslin, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nRothko's friend, the art critic [[Dore Ashton]], points to the artist's acquaintance with poet Stanley Kunitz as a significant bond in this period (\"conversations between painter and poet fed into Rothko's enterprise\"). Kunitz saw Rothko as \"a primitive, a shaman who finds the magic formula and leads people to it\". Great poetry and painting, Kunitz believed, both had \"roots in magic, incantation, and spell-casting\" and were, at their core, ethical and spiritual. Kunitz instinctively understood the purpose of Rothko's quest.<ref>Ashton, pp. 150\u2013151.</ref>\n\nIn November 1958, Rothko gave an address to the [[Pratt Institute]]. In a tenor unusual for him, he discussed art as a trade and offered the \"recipe of a work of art\u2014its ingredients\u2014how to make it\u2014the formula.\n\n# There must be a clear preoccupation with death\u2014intimations of mortality ... Tragic art, romantic art, etc., deals with the knowledge of death.\n# Sensuality. Our basis of being concrete about the world. It is a lustful relationship to things that exist.\n# Tension. Either conflict or curbed desire.\n# Irony, This is a modern ingredient\u2014the self-effacement and examination by which a man for an instant can go on to something else.\n# Wit and play ... for the human element.\n# The ephemeral and chance ... for the human element.\n# Hope. 10% to make the tragic concept more endurable.\n\nI measure these ingredients very carefully when I paint a picture. It is always the form that follows these elements and the picture results from the proportions of these elements.\"<ref>Achim Borchardt-Hume (ed.). ''Rothko'' (London: Tate Gallery, 2008), p. 91</ref>\n\n===Seagram Murals\u2013Four Seasons restaurant commission===\n{{anchor|Seagram}}In 1958, Rothko was awarded the first of two major mural commissions, which proved both rewarding and frustrating.<ref>Breslin, pp. 371\u2013383, 404\u2013409, is a thorough account of this important episode in Rothko's career.</ref> The beverage company [[Seagram|Joseph Seagram and Sons]] had recently completed the new [[Seagram Building]] skyscraper on [[Park Avenue]], designed by architects [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Philip Johnson]]. Rothko agreed to provide paintings for the building's new luxury restaurant, [[The Four Seasons Restaurant|the Four Seasons]]. This was, as art historian [[Simon Schama]] put it, \"bring[ing] his monumental dramas right into the belly of the beast\".<ref>Schama, p. 398.</ref>\n\nFor Rothko, this commission presented a new challenge, since it was the first time he was required not only to design a coordinated series of paintings, but to produce an artwork space concept for a large, specific interior. Over the following three months, Rothko completed forty paintings, comprising three full series in dark red and brown. He altered his horizontal format to vertical, to complement the restaurant's vertical features: columns, walls, doors and windows.\n\nThe following June, Rothko and his family again traveled to Europe. While on the [[SS Independence|SS ''Independence'']] he disclosed to journalist John Fischer, who was publisher of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', that his true intention for the Seagram murals was to paint \"something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room\". He hoped, he told Fischer, that his painting would make the restaurant's patrons \"feel that they are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up, so that all they can do is butt their heads forever against the wall\".<ref>Breslin, p. 376.</ref>\n\n[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|Vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]\n[[File:Villa dei Misteri (Pompei) WLM 025.JPG|thumb|Frescoes in the Villa of the Mysteries]]\nWhile in Europe, the Rothkos traveled to Rome, Florence, Venice and Pompeii. In Florence, he visited [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Laurentian Library]], to see first-hand the library's vestibule, from which he drew further inspiration for the murals.<ref>Ashton, p. 147.</ref> He remarked that \"the room had exactly the feeling that I wanted ... it gives the visitor the feeling of being caught in a room with the doors and windows walled-in shut.\" He was further influenced by the somber colors of the murals in the Pompeiian [[Villa of the Mysteries]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Feeding fury|author=Jonathan Jones|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 December 2002|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/07/artsfeatures}}</ref> Following the trip to Italy, the Rothkos voyaged to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam, before returning to the United States.\n\nOnce back in New York, Rothko and wife Mell visited the nearly-completed Four Seasons restaurant. Upset with the restaurant's dining atmosphere, which he considered pretentious and inappropriate for the display of his works, Rothko refused to continue the project, and returned his cash advance to the Seagram and Sons Company. Seagram had intended to honor Rothko's emergence to prominence through his selection, and his breach of contract and public expression of outrage were unexpected.\n\nRothko kept the commissioned paintings in storage until 1968. Given that Rothko had known in advance about the luxury decor of the restaurant, and the social class of its future patrons, the motives for his abrupt repudiation remain mysterious. A temperamental personality, Rothko never fully explained his conflicted emotions over the incident.<ref>Schama, pp. 428\u2013434.</ref> One reading is offered by his biographer, James E.B. Breslin: the Seagram project could be seen as an acting-out of a familiar, in this case self-created \"drama of trust and betrayal, of advancing into the world, then withdrawing, angrily, from it ... He was an Isaac who at the last moment refused to yield to Abraham.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 408.</ref> The final series of ''Seagram Murals'' was dispersed, and now hangs in three locations: London's [[Tate Modern]] in its own Mark Rothko room, Japan's [[Kawamura Memorial Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/display/mark-rothko |title=Tate Modern, Rothko Murals |publisher=Tate.org.uk |accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> This episode was the main basis for [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]'s 2009 play ''[[Red (play)|Red]]''.\n\nIn October 2012, ''[[Black on Maroon]]'', one of the paintings in the Seagram series, was defaced with writing in black ink, while on display at Tate Modern. Restoration of the painting took eighteen months to complete. The [[BBC]]'s Arts Editor [[Will Gompertz]] explained that the ink from the vandal's marker pen had bled all the way through the canvas, causing \"a deep wound, not a superficial graze\", and that the vandal had caused \"significant damage\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/13/tate-modern-unveils-restored-mark-rothko-black-on-maroon |title=Tate Modern unveils painstakingly restored Rothko|date=13 May 2014|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Rising American prominence===\nRothko's first completed space was created in the [[Phillips Collection]] in Washington, D.C., following the purchase of four paintings by collector [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]]. Rothko's fame and wealth had substantially increased; his paintings began to sell to notable collectors, including the [[Rockefeller family]]. In January 1961, Rothko sat next to [[Joseph Kennedy]] at [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inaugural ball. Later that year, a retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, to considerable commercial and critical success. In spite of this newfound fame, the art world had already turned its attention from the now pass\u00e9 abstract expressionists to the \"next big thing\", [[pop art]], particularly the work of [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein|Lichtenstein]], and [[James Rosenquist|Rosenquist]].\n\nRothko labeled pop-art artists \"charlatans and young opportunists\", and wondered aloud during a 1962 exhibition of pop art, \"Are the young artists plotting to kill us all?\" On viewing [[Jasper Johns]]'s flags, Rothko said, \"We worked for years to get rid of all that.\"<ref>Breslin, p. 427.</ref> It was not that Rothko could not accept being replaced, but that he could not accept what was replacing him: he found pop art vapid.\n\nOn August 31, 1963, Mell gave birth to a second child, Christopher.<ref>Breslin, p. 431.</ref> That autumn, Rothko signed with the [[Marlborough Gallery]] for sales of his work outside the United States. In New York, he continued to sell the artwork directly from his studio.<ref>Breslin, p. 443.</ref> Bernard Reis, Rothko's financial advisor, was also, unbeknownst to the artist, the gallery's accountant and, together with his co-workers, was later responsible for one of art history's largest scandals.\n\n===Harvard Murals===\nRothko received a second mural commission project, this time for a room of paintings for the penthouse of Harvard University's [[Holyoke Center]]. He made twenty-two sketches, from which ten wall-sized paintings on canvas were painted, six were brought to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and only five were hung: a triptych on one wall and opposite two individual panels. His aim was to create an environment for a public place. Harvard President [[Nathan Pusey]], following an explanation of the religious symbology of the [[Triptych]], had the paintings hung in January 1963, and later shown at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]]. During installation, Rothko found the paintings to be compromised by the room's lighting. Despite the installation of fiberglass shades, the paintings were all removed by 1979 and, due to the fugitive nature of some of the red pigments, in particular lithol red, were placed in dark storage and displayed only periodically.<ref>Breslin, pp. 445\u2013457.</ref> The murals were on display from November 16, 2014, to July 26, 2015, in the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, for which the fading of the pigments has been compensated by using an innovative color projection system to illuminate the paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artery.wbur.org/2014/05/20/harvard-rothkos |title=Harvard's Famously Damaged Rothko Paintings 'Restored' With Light |publisher=The ARTery |date=20 May 2014 |first=Andrea |last=Shea |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2014/05/20/harvard-rothko-murals-seen-new-light-with-revolutionary-new-projection-system/UspSbL0csFjeM2cwSflKON/story.html |title=Harvard's Rothko murals to be seen in new light with revolutionary new projection system |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Raskar, R., Cuellar, S., Mohan, A. and Gschwind, R., \u2018Conservation of a room: a treatment proposal for Mark Rothko\u2019s Harvard Murals,\u2019 Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 348-361</ref><ref>Stenger, J., Khandekar, N., Wilker, A., Kallsen, K., Kirby, D.P. and Eremin, K., \u2018The making of Mark Rothko\u2019s Harvard Murals,\u2019 Studies in Conservation, 61(6), 2016, 331-347.</ref>\n\n===Rothko Chapel===\n[[File:Rothko Chapel 2007-03-13.jpg|left|thumb|Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas]]\nThe [[Rothko Chapel]] is located adjacent to the [[Menil Collection]] and [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|The University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]], Texas. The building is small and windowless. It is a geometric, \"postmodern\" structure, located in a turn-of-the-century middle-class Houston neighborhood. The Chapel, the Menil Collection, and the nearby [[Cy Twombly]] gallery were funded by Texas oil millionaires [[Dominique de Menil|John and Dominique de Menil]].\n[[File:153 East 69th Street.jpg|thumb|Rothko's studio on 153 East 69th Street in New York's Upper East Side]]\nIn 1964, Rothko moved into his last New York studio at 157 East 69th Street, equipping the studio with pulleys carrying large walls of canvas material to regulate light from a central cupola, to simulate lighting he planned for the Rothko Chapel. Despite warnings about the difference in light between New York and Texas, Rothko persisted with the experiment, setting to work on the canvases. Rothko told friends he intended the chapel to be his single most important artistic statement. He became considerably involved in the layout of the building, insisting that it feature a central cupola like that of his studio. Architect [[Philip Johnson]], unable to compromise with Rothko's vision about the kind of light he wanted in the space, left the project in 1967, and was replaced with [[Howard Barnstone]] and Eugene Aubry.<ref>Ashton, p. 183. Johnson would always maintain, and Ashton acknowledges that he was probably right, that he (Johnson) knew better than Rothko what lighting would best work in the chapel.</ref> The architects frequently flew to New York to consult and on one occasion brought with them a miniature of the building for Rothko's approval.\n\nFor Rothko, the chapel was to be a destination, a place of pilgrimage far from the center of art (in this case, New York) where seekers of Rothko's newly \"religious\" artwork could journey. Initially, the chapel, now non-denominational, was to be specifically [[Roman Catholic]], and during the first three years of the project (1964\u201367) Rothko believed it would remain so. Thus, Rothko's design of the building and the religious implications of the paintings were inspired by Roman Catholic art and architecture. Its octagonal shape is based on a [[Byzantine]] church of St. Maria Assunta, and the format of the triptychs is based on paintings of the [[Crucifixion]]. The de Menils believed the universal \"spiritual\" aspect of Rothko's work would complement the elements of Roman Catholicism.\n\nRothko's painting technique required considerable physical stamina that the ailing artist was no longer able to muster. To create the paintings he envisioned, Rothko was forced to hire two assistants, to apply the chestnut-brown paint in quick strokes of several layers: \"brick reds, deep reds, black mauves\". On half of the works, Rothko applied none of the paint himself, and was for the most part content to supervise the slow, arduous process. He felt the completion of the paintings to be \"torment\", and the inevitable result was to create \"something you don't want to look at\".\n\nThe chapel is the culmination of six years of Rothko's life, and represents his gradually growing concern for the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]]. For some, to witness these paintings is to submit one's self to a spiritual experience, which, through its transcendence of subject matter, approximates that of consciousness itself. It forces one to approach the limits of experience, and awakens one to the awareness of one's own existence. For others, the chapel houses fourteen large paintings whose dark, nearly impenetrable surfaces represent hermeticism and contemplation.\n\nThe chapel paintings consist of a monochrome triptych in soft brown, on the central wall, comprising three 5-by-15-foot panels, and a pair of triptychs on the left and right, made of opaque black rectangles. Between the triptychs are four individual paintings, measuring 11-by-15 feet each. One additional individual painting faces the central triptych, from the opposite wall. The effect is to surround the viewer with massive, imposing visions of darkness. Despite its basis in religious symbolism (the triptych) and less-than-subtle imagery (the crucifixion), the paintings are difficult to attach specifically to traditional Christian motifs, and may act on the viewers subliminally. Active spiritual or aesthetic inquiry may be elicited from the viewer, in the same way a religious icon with specific symbolism does. In this way, Rothko's erasure of symbols both removes and creates barriers to the work.\n\nAs it turned out, these works would be his final artistic statement to the world. They were finally unveiled at the chapel's opening in 1971. Rothko never saw the completed chapel, and never installed the paintings. On February 28, 1971, at the dedication, Dominique de Menil said, \"We are cluttered with images and only abstract art can bring us to the threshold of the divine\", noting Rothko's courage in painting what might be called \"impenetrable fortresses\" of color. The drama for many critics of Rothko's work is the uneasy position of the paintings between, as Chase notes, \"nothingness or vapidity\" and \"dignified 'mute icons' offering 'the only kind of beauty we find acceptable today'\".\n\n==Suicide and estate lawsuit==\n[[File:RothkoBlackGray.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Untitled (Black on Grey)]]'', 1970]]\nIn early 1968, Rothko was diagnosed with a mild aortic aneurysm. Ignoring doctor's orders, Rothko continued to drink and smoke heavily, avoided exercise, and maintained an unhealthy diet. \"Highly nervous, thin, restless\", was his friend [[Dore Ashton]]'s description of Rothko at this time.<ref>Ashton, p. 188.</ref> However, he did follow the medical advice given not to paint pictures larger than a yard in height, and turned his attention to smaller, less physically strenuous formats, including acrylics on paper. Meanwhile, Rothko's marriage had become increasingly troubled, and his poor health and impotence resulting from the aneurysm compounded his feeling of estrangement in the relationship.<ref>Breslin, p. 490</ref> Rothko and his wife Mell (1921\u20131970) separated on New Year's Day 1969, and he moved into his studio.\n\nOn February 25, 1970, Oliver Steindecker, Rothko's assistant, found the artist in his kitchen, lying dead on the floor in front of the sink, covered in blood. He overdosed on [[barbiturates]], and cut an artery in his right arm with a razor blade.<ref name=\"sui\">{{cite news |last=Cooke |first=Rachel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/14/art1 |title=The art cheats who betrayed my father |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2018-03-17 }}</ref> There was no suicide note.

Reis later sold the paintings to the [[Marlborough Gallery]], at substantially reduced values, and then split the profits from sales with Gallery representatives. In 1971, Rothko's children filed a lawsuit against Reis, Morton Levine, and [[Theodoros Stamos|Theodore Stamos]], the executors of his estate, over the sham sales. The lawsuit continued for more than 10 years, and became known as the [[Rothko Case]]. In 1975, the defendants were found liable for negligence and conflict of interest, were removed as executors of the Rothko estate by court order, and, along with Marlborough Gallery, were required to pay a $9.2 million damages judgment to the estate. This amount represents only a small fraction of the eventual vast financial value, since achieved, by numerous Rothko works produced in his lifetime.<ref>(case cite 372 N.E.2d 291)</ref>\n\nRothko's separated wife Mell, also a heavy drinker, died six months after him at the age of 48.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

1943&nbsp;\u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.
