The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mix-to-positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1996, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point, and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 8.</ref><ref name=\"EW7\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292721,00.html The 1996 Summer Movie Preview: July] ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved July 8, 2008.</ref>\n\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field \u2026[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"<ref name=\"ID42\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 93.</ref> Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"<ref name=\"ID42\"/> The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,<ref name=\"ID41\" /> and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, [[20th Century Fox]] chairman [[Peter Chernin]] greenlit the screenplay.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\"/> The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's [[Area 51]] references.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.<ref name=\"EW7\"/> The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than [[Digimation|computer-generated effects]] in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Many of these shots were accomplished at [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]] in [[Culver City, California]], where the film's art department, [[motion control photography]] teams, [[pyrotechnics]] team, and model shop were headquartered{{doubtful|date=July 2018}}. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72.</ref> The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a {{Convert|30|ft|adj=mid}} destroyer model<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 54.</ref> and a version of the mother ship spanning {{convert|12|ft}}.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 121.</ref> City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards.

A second unit gathered plate shots and [[establishing shot]]s of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] community in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= \"Aberly and Engel p. 91\"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Ventures|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]], and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]], and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]] and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1995, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point, and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities.

Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.

Many of these farms became dense housing developments and subdivisions by the 1970s. Lexington always had a bustling downtown area, which remains to this day. Lexington began to prosper, helped by its proximity to Boston, and having a rail line (originally the [[Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad]], later the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]) service its citizens and businesses, beginning in 1846 until 1981. In 1984, Due to the rapid urbanization that occurred in many other suburbs like Lexington, The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|M]]BTA proposed expanding the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] through Lexington, terminating in Bedford. Despite Lexington and Bedford being on board with the idea, Arlington residents lobbied against the plan and it was shot down by the Board of Selectmen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boston.curbed.com/2014/2/13/10144086/the-red-line-stops-in-arlington-and-lexington|title=The Red Line Stops in Arlington and Lexington|last=Acitelli|first=Tom|date=2014-02-13|website=Curbed Boston|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\nLexington, as well as many of the towns along the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] corridor, experienced a jump in population in the 1960s and 70s, due to the high-tech boom.

It provided for many types of mills, and in the 20th Century, for farm irrigation.\n\n=== Battle of Lexington ===\n{{See also|Battles of Lexington and Concord}}\nOn April 19, 1775, what many regard as the first battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] was [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the Battle at Lexington]]. On the night of April 18, The British Army had set out 700 troops on foot from [[Boston]], with the intention of destroying Colonial gunpowder and cannons that was being stored in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], as well as capturing [[Sons of Liberty]] leaders [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]].<ref name=\"Battles of Lexington and Concord\">{{Citation|title=Battles of Lexington and Concord|date=2020-01-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord&oldid=935264612|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Word got out due to riders [[Paul Revere]], [[William Dawes]] and [[Samuel Prescott]], who alerted local minuteman of the British Movements.

Many of these farms became dense housing developments and subdivisions by the 1970s. Lexington always had a bustling downtown area, which remains to this day. Lexington began to prosper, helped by its proximity to Boston, and having a rail line (originally the [[Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad]], later the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]) service its citizens and businesses, beginning in 1846 until 1981. In 1984, Due to the rapid urbanization that occurred in many other suburbs like Lexington, The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|M]]BTA proposed expanding the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] through Lexington, terminating in Bedford. Despite Lexington and Bedford being on board with the idea, Arlington residents lobbied against the plan and it was shot down by the Board of Selectmen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boston.curbed.com/2014/2/13/10144086/the-red-line-stops-in-arlington-and-lexington|title=The Red Line Stops in Arlington and Lexington|last=Acitelli|first=Tom|date=2014-02-13|website=Curbed Boston|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\nLexington, as well as many of the towns along the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] corridor, experienced a jump in population in the 1960s and 70s, due to the high-tech boom.

Due to the lag time between these interplanetary events and mission planning time, opportunities to gain new knowledge about the cosmos might be lost. To prevent this, JAXA plans on using smaller, faster missions from 2010 onward.\n\nIn 2012, new legislation extended JAXA's remit from peaceful purposes only to include some military space development, such as missile early warning systems. Political control of JAXA passed from MEXT to the Prime Minister's [[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]] through a new Space Strategy Office.<ref name=defensenews-20120622>{{cite news |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120622/DEFREG03/306220001/Japan-Passes-Law-Permitting-Military-Space-Development |title=Japan Passes Law Permitting Military Space Development |newspaper=Defense News |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:JAXA Head office.JPG|thumb|200px|Head Office.]]\n[[File:H-IIA F13 launching KAGUYA.jpg|thumb|200px|Tanegashima Space Center.]]\n\nJAXA is composed of the following organizations:\n* Space Technology Directorate I\n* Space Technology Directorate II\n* Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate\n* Research and Development Directorate\n* Aeronautical Technology Directorate\n* Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS)\n* Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center\n\nJAXA has research centers in many locations in Japan, and some offices overseas.

For experiments in the upper atmosphere JAXA uses the SS-520, [[S-520]], and [[S-310]] [[sounding rocket]]s.\n\n==Communication ground stations for interplanetary spacecraft==\n{{empty section|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Successes ==\n\nBefore the establishment of JAXA, ISAS had been most successful in its space program in the field of X-ray astronomy during the 1980s and 1990s. Another fruitful area for Japan has been [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) with the [[HALCA]] mission. Additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the [[magnetosphere]], among other areas.\n\nNASDA was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology. However, since the satellite market of Japan is entirely open, the first time a Japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005. Another prime focus of the NASDA body is Earth [[climate]] observation.\n\nJAXA was awarded the [[Space Foundation]]'s John L. \"Jack\" Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060101/http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n== Launch development ==\n[[File:H-II series.png|180px|right|thumb|H-IIA & H-IIB.]]\n\n=== Rocket history ===\nJapan launched its first satellite, [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]], in 1970, using ISAS' [[Lambda (rocket)|L-4S]] rocket. Before the merger, ISAS used small solid-fueled launch vehicles, while NASDA developed larger liquid-fueled launchers. In the beginning, NASDA used licensed American models. The first model of liquid-fueled launch vehicle indigenously developed in Japan was the [[H-II]], introduced in 1994. However, at the end of the 1990s, with two H-II launch failures, Japanese rocket technology began to face criticism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/11/25/Japan-launches-first-commercial-satellite/8821448472152/ |title=Japan launches first commercial satellite |last=Shim |first=Elizabeth |date=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Early H-IIA missions ===\nJapan's first space mission under JAXA, an H-IIA rocket launch on 29 November 2003, failed due to stress problems. After a 15-month hiatus, JAXA performed a successful launch of an H-IIA rocket from [[Tanegashima Space Center]], placing a satellite into orbit on 26 February 2005.\n\n=== Epsilon Rocket ===\nTo be able to launch a smaller mission on JAXA developed a new solid-fueled rocket, the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] as a replacement to the retired [[M-V]]. The maiden flight successfully happened in 2013. So far, the rocket has flown four times without any launch failures.\n\n=== Orbital SS-520 mission ===\nIn January 2017, JAXA attempted and failed to put a miniature satellite into orbit atop one of its SS520 series rockets.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kyodo|date=15 January 2017|title=JAXA fails in bid to launch world\u2019s smallest satellite-carrying rocket|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/15/national/science-health/japan-launches-worlds-smallest-satellite-carrying-rocket/#.WH00OlMrJEY|newspaper=The Japan Times|location= |access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> A second attempt on February 2, 2018 was successful, putting a ten-pound CubeSat into Earth orbit.

To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth swing by orbits with the [[Hiten]] mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi]] (PLANET-B), which was launched in 1998. It passed Mars in 2003 but failed to reach Mars orbit due to maneuvering systems failures earlier in the mission. Currently, interplanetary missions remain at the ISAS group under the JAXA umbrella. However, for FY 2008, JAXA is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization. New head for this group will be [[Hayabusa]] project manager Kawaguchi.<ref>[http://ilwsonline.org/china_jaxa.pdf Agency\u2019s Report from ISAS/JAXA to ILWS WG meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107214927/http://ilwsonline.org/china_jaxa.pdf |date=7 January 2016 }}, [[Living With a Star]], July 23, 2006</ref>{{update-inline|date=October 2018}}\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[PLANET-C]], [[IKAROS]], [[Hayabusa 2]]<br />\n''' Under Development:''' [[Smart Lander for Investigating Moon|SLIM]], [[Martian Moons Explorer|MMX]], [[DESTINY PLUS|DESTINY<sup>+</sup>]]<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[PLANET-B]], [[SELENE]], [[MUSES-C]]<br />\n'''Cancelled:''' [[LUNAR-A]]\n\n=== Small body exploration: Hayabusa mission ===\n{{See also|Hayabusa 2}}\n[[File:Hayabusa hover.jpg|thumb|[[Hayabusa]]]]\nOn 9 May 2003, [[Hayabusa]] (meaning, [[Peregrine falcon]]), was launched from an [[M-V]] rocket. The goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small [[near-Earth asteroid]] named [[25143 Itokawa]]. The craft [[space rendezvous|rendezvoused]] with the asteroid in September 2005. It was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in November 2005, after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data. Hayabusa returned to Earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 June 2010.\n\n=== Lunar explorations ===\nAfter [[Hiten]] in 1990, ISAS planned a lunar penetrator mission called [[LUNAR-A]], but after delays due to technical problems, the project was terminated in January 2007. The seismometer penetrator design for LUNAR-A may be reused in a future mission.\n\nOn 14 September 2007, JAXA succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer ''[[SELENE|Kaguya]]'', also known as SELENE (costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle), the largest such mission since the [[Apollo program]], on an [[H-2A]] rocket. Its mission is to gather data on the [[Moon#Origin and geologic evolution|Moon's origin and evolution]].

The [[Mars]] explorer [[Nozomi (spacecraft)|Nozomi]] (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched before the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000&nbsp;km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the [[Venus]] Climate Orbiter ''[[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|Akatsuki]]'' (PLANET-C) and [[IKAROS]] solar sail demonstrator was launched by a [[H-2A]] launch vehicle.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit on 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the planned initially orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's primary goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's [[Atmosphere of Venus#Circulation|super-rotation]], a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the troposphere circulates the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.\n \nJAXA/ISAS was part of the international [[Europa Jupiter System Mission \u2013 Laplace|Laplace]] [[Jupiter]] mission proposal from its foundation. A Japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research Jupiter's magnetosphere, [[Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter|JMO]] (Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter). Although JMO never left the conception phase, ISAS scientists will see their instruments reaching Jupiter on the ESA-led [[Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer|JUICE]] (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission. JUICE is a reformulation of the ESA [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] orbiter from the Laplace project. JAXA's contribution includes providing components of the RPWI (Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation), PEP (Particle Environment Package), GALA (Ganymede Laser Altimeter) instruments.\n\nJAXA is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the Martian system; a sample return mission to [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] called [[Martian Moons Explorer|MMX]] (Martian Moons Explorer).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/10/national/science-health/jaxa-plans-probe-bring-back-samples-martian-moons/|title=JAXA plans probe to bring back samples from moons of Mars|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/2016/ISASnews418.pdf#page=3 |title=ISAS\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 2016.1 No.418 |publisher= [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=2016-02-04 |language=Japanese}}</ref> First revealed in 9 June 2015, MMX's primary goal is to determine the origin of the [[Martian moons]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Torishima |first=Shinya |date=June 19, 2015 |title=JAXA\u306e\u300c\u706b\u661f\u306e\u885b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30fb\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u300d\u8a08\u753b\u3068\u306f |url=http://news.mynavi.jp/series/jaxa_mars/001/ |language=Japanese |newspaper=Mynavi News |accessdate=2015-10-06 }}</ref> Alongside collecting samples from Phobos, MMX will perform [[remote sensing]] of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], and may also observe the [[atmosphere of Mars]] as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cps-jp.org/~tansa/pub/2015/2015-08-27/10_imamura/src/20150827_10_imamura.pdf |title=\u9ad8\u6642\u9593\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u89b3\u6e2c\u304c\u3072\u3089\u304f\u706b\u661f\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u6c34\u5faa\u74b0\u306e\u79d1\u5b66 |publisher=Center for Planetary Science |format=PDF |date=28 August 2015 |access-date=2016-02-04 |language=Japanese}}</ref> As of January 2016, MMX is to be launched in fiscal year 2022.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 4, 2016 |title=JAXA\u3001\u706b\u661f\u885b\u661f\u300c\u30d5\u30a9\u30dc\u30b9\u300d\u63a2\u67fb\u2026\uff12\uff12\u5e74\u306b |url =http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/20160104-OYT1T50063.html |archive-url =https://archive.today/20160104080052/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/20160104-OYT1T50063.html |url-status =dead |archive-date =January 4, 2016 |language=Japanese |newspaper=[[The Yomiuri Shimbun]] |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n{{See also|BepiColombo}}\n\n=== Solar sail research ===\nOn 9 August 2004, ISAS successfully deployed two prototypes [[solar sail]]s from a sounding rocket. A clover-type sail was deployed at 122&nbsp;km altitude and a fan type sail were deployed at 169&nbsp;km altitude. Both sails used 7.5 [[micrometre|micrometer]]-thick film.\n\nISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub-payload to the [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] (ASTRO-F) mission on 22 February 2006. However, the solar sail did not deploy fully. ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the [[Hinode (satellite)|SOLAR-B]] launch on 23 September 2006, but contact with the probe was lost. The [[IKAROS]] solar sail was launched on 21 May 2010. The solar sail deployed successfully. The goal is to have a solar sail mission to Jupiter after 2020.\n\n== Astronomy program ==\n{{See also|Scientific research on the ISS}}\n\nThe first Japanese astronomy mission was x-raying satellite Hakucho (Corsa-B), which was launched in 1979. Later ISAS moved into solar observation, radio astronomy through Space [[VLBI]], and infrared astronomy.\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[Hinode (satellite)|SOLAR-B]], [[MAXI (ISS Experiment)|MAXI]], [[SPRINT-A]], and [[CALET]]<br />\n''' Under Development:''' [[X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission|XRISM]]<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[ASTRO-F]], [[ASTRO-EII]], and [[ASTRO-H]]<br />\n'''Cancelled:''' [[ASTRO-G]]\n\n=== Infrared astronomy ===\n[[File:Astro-E clean-room.jpg|thumb|right|ASTRO-E.]]\nJapan's first infrared astronomy mission was the 15-cm [[Infrared Telescope in Space|IRTS]] telescope, which was part of the [[Space Flyer Unit|SFU]] multipurpose satellite in 1995. IRTS scanned during its one-month lifetime around 7% of the sky before SFU got brought back to Earth by the Space Shuttle. During the 1990s, JAXA also gave ground support for the [[ESA]] [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) infrared mission.\n\nThe next step for JAXA was the [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] spacecraft, with the pre-launch designation [[ASTRO-F]]. This satellite was launched on 21 February 2006. Its mission is [[infrared]] astronomy with a 68&nbsp;cm telescope. This is the first all-sky survey since the first infrared mission [[IRAS]] in 1983.\n(A 3.6&nbsp;kg [[nanosatellite]] named [[CUTE-1.7]] was also released from the same launch vehicle.)<ref>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2006-005A Akari], NSSDCA</ref>\n\nJAXA is also doing further R&D for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission, [[SPICA spacecraft|SPICA]]. This would enable a warm launch without liquid helium. SPICA has the same size as the ESA [[Herschel Space Observatory]] mission, but is planned to have a temperature of just 4.5 K and will be much colder. Unlike Akari, which had a [[geocentric orbit]], SPICA will be located at Sun-Earth {{L2|nolink=no}}. The launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on JAXA's new [[H3 Launch Vehicle]]. However, the mission is not yet fully funded. ESA and [[NASA]] may also each contribute an instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/article/interview/no19/p4_e.html|title=JAXA - Takao Nakagawa - Dramatic Birth and Death of Stars -|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== X-ray astronomy ===\n{{See also|ASTRO-H}}\n\nStarting from 1979 with [[Hakucho]] (CORSA-b), for nearly two decades Japan had achieved continuous observation with its [[Hinotori (satellite)|Hinotori]], [[Tenma]], [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]] and [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics|ASCA]] (ASTRO-A through D) x-ray observation satellites. However, in the year 2000, the launch of Japan's fifth x-ray observation satellite, [[ASTRO-E]] failed (as it failed at launch, it never received a proper name).\n\nThen on 10 July 2005, JAXA was finally able to launch a new [[X-ray astronomy]] mission named [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]] (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA because in the five years since the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an [[x-ray telescope]]. Three instruments were included in this satellite: an [[X-ray spectrometer]] (XRS), an [[X-ray imaging spectrometer]] (XIS), and a [[hard X-ray detector]] (HXD). However, the XRS was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction, which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium.\n\nThe next JAXA x-ray mission is the [[MAXI (ISS Experiment)|Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI)]]. MAXI continuously monitors astronomical X-ray objects over a broad energy band (0.5 to 30 keV). MAXI is installed on the Japanese external module of the ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iss.sfo.jaxa.jp/kibo/kibomefc/maxi_e.html |title=MAXI:Experiment - International Space Station - JAXA |author=JAXA |accessdate=12 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521055336/http://iss.sfo.jaxa.jp/kibo/kibomefc/maxi_e.html |archivedate=21 May 2013 }}</ref> On 17 February 2016, [[Hitomi (satellite)|Hitomi]] (ASTRO-H) was launched as the successor to Suzaku, which completed its mission a year before.\n\n=== Solar observation ===\nJapan's solar astronomy started in the early 1980s with the launch of the ''[[Hinotori (satellite)|Hinotori]]'' (ASTRO-A) x-ray mission.

As H-2A is more powerful, SOLAR-C could either be heavier or be stationed at {{L1}} ([[Lagrange point]] 1).\n\n=== Radio astronomy ===\nIn 1998 Japan launched the [[HALCA]] (MUSES-B) Mission, the world's first spacecraft dedicated to conducting SPACE VLBI observations of pulsars, among others. To do so, ISAS set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation. The observation part of the mission lasted until 2003, and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005. In FY 2006, Japan funded the [[ASTRO-G]] as the succeeding mission.\n\n== Communication, positioning and technology tests ==\nOne of the primary duties of the former NASDA body was the testing of new space technologies, mostly in the field of communication. The first test satellite was ETS-I, launched in 1975. However, during the 1990s, NASDA was afflicted by problems surrounding the ETS-VI and COMETS missions.\n\nIn February 2018, JAXA announced a research collaboration with [[Sony]] to test a [[laser communication in space|laser communication]] system from the Kibo module in late 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAXA {{!}} Laser Link Communications Technology and Kibo Cooperative Research Agreement by JAXA, Sony CSL and Sony|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2018/02/20180208_i-seep.html|website=JAXA {{!}} Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nTesting of communication technologies remains to be one of JAXA's critical duties in cooperation with [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology|NICT]].\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[Reimei|INDEX]], [[QZS-1]], [[SLATS]], [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZS-2]], QZS-3, QZS-4<br />\n'''Under Development:''' ETS-IX<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[OICETS]], [[ETS-VIII]], [[WINDS]]<br />\n\n=== i-Space : ETS-VIII, WINDS and QZS-1 ===\nTo upgrade Japan's communication technology the Japanese state launched the i-Space initiative with the ETS-VIII and WINDS missions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i-space.jaxa.jp/ispace.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225200106/http://i-space.jaxa.jp/ispace.html |archivedate=25 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nETS-VIII was launched on 18 December 2006. The purpose of [[ETS-VIII]] is to test communication equipment with two massive antennas and an atomic clock test. On 26 December, both antennas were successfully deployed. This was not unexpected since JAXA tested the deployment mechanism before with the LDREX-2 Mission, which was launched on 14 October with the European Ariane 5. The test was successful. The mission of [[WINDS]] (Kizuna) is to create the world's fastest satellite Internet connection. WINDS was launched in February 2008.\n\n=== OICETS and INDEX ===\nOn 24 August 2005, JAXA launched the experimental satellites [[OICETS]] and [[Reimei|INDEX]] on a Ukrainian [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]]. OICETS (Kirari) is a mission tasked with testing optical links with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) [[ARTEMIS]] satellite, which is around 40,000&nbsp;km away from OICETS. The experiment was successful on 9 December, when the link could be established. In March 2006, JAXA could establish with OICETS the worldwide first optical links between an LEO satellite and a ground station first in Japan and in June 2006 with a mobile station in Germany.\n\nINDEX (Reimei) is a small 70&nbsp;kg satellite for testing various equipment, and functions as an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] observation mission as well. The Reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase.\n\n== Earth observation programme ==\nJapan's first Earth observation satellites were MOS-1a and MOS-1b launched in 1987 and 1990. During the 1990s and the new millennium, this programme came under heavy fire, because both Adeos (Midori) and [[Adeos 2]] (Midori 2) satellites failed after just ten months in orbit.\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[GOSAT]], [[GCOM-W]], [[ALOS-2]], [[GCOM-C]], GOSAT-2<br />\n'''Under Development:''' ALOS-3<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[ALOS]]<br />\n\n=== ALOS ===\n[[File:MTSAT-1.jpg|right|thumb|MTSAT-1]]\nIn January 2006, JAXA successfully launched the [[Advanced Land Observation Satellite]] (ALOS/Daichi). Communication between ALOS and the ground station in Japan will be done through the Kodama Data Relay Satellite, which was launched during 2002. This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth Observation Mission. For missions following Daichi, JAXA opted to separate it into a radar satellite ([[ALOS-2]]) and an optical satellite (ALOS-3). ALOS 2 SAR was launched in May 2014.\n\n=== Rainfall observation ===\nSince Japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a fundamental issue. For this reason, Japan launched in 1997 the [[TRMM]] (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research, NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons,{{specify|reason=what would those reasons be?|date=November 2017}} both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, an H-2A rocket launched the [[GPM Core Observatory]], a satellite jointly developed by JAXA and NASA. The GPM mission is the successor of the TRMM mission, which by the time of the GPM launch, had been noted as highly successful. JAXA provided the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]]/Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM/DPR) Instrument for this mission. Global Precipitation Measurement itself is a satellite constellation, whilst the GPM Core Observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation. Other countries/agencies like France, India, ESA, etc. provide the sub-satellites. GPM aims to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail.\n\n=== Monitoring of carbon dioxide ===\nAt the end of the 2008 fiscal year, JAXA launched the satellite [[GOSAT]] (Greenhouse Gas Observing SATellite) to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The satellite is being jointly developed by JAXA and Japan's [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]].  JAXA is building the satellite while the Ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected. Since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the world's atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe, the GOSAT may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground.  Sensors for [[methane]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]ses are also being considered for the satellite, although the plans are not yet finalized. The satellite weighs approximately 1650&nbsp;kg and is expected to have a life span of five years.\n\n=== GCOM series ===\nThe next funded Earth-observation mission after GOSAT is the GCOM ([[Global Change Observation Mission]]) Earth-observation programme as a successor to ADEOS II (Midori) and the [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time, the mission will be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, [[GCOM-W]] (Shizuku), was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The launch of the second satellite, [[GCOM-C]], is currently planned for 2017.\n\n== Satellites for other agencies ==\nFor weather observation, Japan launched in February 2005 the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R ([[MTSAT|MTSAT-1R]]). The success of this launch was critical for Japan since the original MTSAT-1 could not be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the H-2 rocket in 1999. Since then, Japan relied on weather forecasting on an old satellite, which was already beyond its useful life term and on American systems.\n\nOn 18 February 2006, JAXA, as head of the H-IIA at this time, successfully launched the MTSAT-2 aboard an H-2A rocket. MTSAT-2 is the backup to the MTSAT-1R. The MTSAT-2 uses the DS-2000 satellite bus developed by Mitsubishi Electric.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/society/space/products/platform_b.html |title=\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb\u88fd\u54c1\u30fb\u885b\u661f\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\uff0fDS2000 |language=Japanese |publisher=Mitsubishi Electric |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822142407/http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/society/space/products/platform_b.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}</ref>  The DS-2000 is also used for the DRTS Kodama, ETS-VIII, and the Superbird 7 communication satellite, making it the first commercial success for Japan.\n\nAs a secondary mission, both the MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 help to direct air traffic.\n\n== Other JAXA satellites currently in use ==\n* [[GEOTAIL]] magnetosphere observation satellite (since 1992)\n* [[DRTS]] (Kodama) Data Relay Satellite, since 2002.

Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite will be in a zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled primary independent mission for JAXA, as no significant civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However, it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. The first launch is planned for 2010. In 2009 Japan also plans to launch a new version of the IGS with an improved resolution of 60&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Launch schedule ===\nThe maiden flight of the [[H-IIB]] and the HTV occurred on 1 September 2009.

JAXA was formed as an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] administered by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]] (MIC).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jaxa.jp/about/law/law_e.pdf |title= Law Concerning Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nBefore the merger, ISAS was responsible for [[outer space|space]] and planetary research, while NAL was focused on aviation research. NASDA, which was founded on 1 October 1969, had developed [[rocket]]s, satellites, and also built the [[Japanese Experiment Module]]. The old NASDA headquarters were located at the current site of the [[Tanegashima Space Center]], on [[Tanegashima|Tanegashima Island]], 115 kilometers south of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]].

Another successful area for Japan  has been [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) with the [[HALCA]] mission. Additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the [[magnetosphere]], among other areas.\n\nNASDA was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology. However, since the satellite market of Japan is completely open, the first time a Japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005. Another prime focus of the NASDA body is Earth [[climate]] observation.\n\nJAXA was awarded the [[Space Foundation]]'s John L. \"Jack\" Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060101/http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n== Launch development ==\n[[File:H-II series.png|180px|right|thumb|H-IIA & H-IIB.]]\n\n=== Rocket history ===\nJapan launched its first satellite, [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]], in 1970, using ISAS' [[Lambda (rocket)|L-4S]] rocket. Prior to the merger, ISAS used small solid-fueled launch vehicles, while NASDA developed larger liquid-fueled launchers. In the beginning, NASDA used licensed American models. The first model of liquid-fuelled launch vehicle indigenously developed in Japan was the [[H-II]], introduced in 1994. However, at the end of the 1990s, with two H-II launch failures, Japanese rocket technology began to face criticism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/11/25/Japan-launches-first-commercial-satellite/8821448472152/ |title=Japan launches first commercial satellite |last=Shim |first=Elizabeth |date=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Early H-IIA missions ===\nJapan's first space mission under JAXA, an H-IIA rocket launch on 29 November 2003, ended in failure due to stress problems. After a 15-month hiatus, JAXA performed a successful launch of an H-IIA rocket from [[Tanegashima Space Center]], placing a satellite into orbit on 26 February 2005.\n\n=== Epsilon Rocket ===\nTo be able to launch smaller mission on JAXA developed a new solid-fueled rocket, the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] as a replacement to the retired [[M-V]].

To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth swing by orbits with the [[Hiten]] mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi]] (PLANET-B), which was launched in 1998. It passed Mars in 2003, but failed to reach Mars orbit due to maneuvering systems failures earlier in the mission. Currently interplanetary missions remain at the ISAS group under the JAXA umbrella. However, for FY 2008 JAXA is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization. New head for this group will be [[Hayabusa]] project manager Kawaguchi.<ref>[http://ilwsonline.org/china_jaxa.pdf Agency\u2019s Report from ISAS/JAXA to ILWS WG meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107214927/http://ilwsonline.org/china_jaxa.pdf |date=7 January 2016 }}, [[Living With a Star]], July 23, 2006</ref>{{update-inline|date=October 2018}}\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[PLANET-C]], [[IKAROS]], [[Hayabusa 2]]<br />\n''' Under Development:''' [[Smart Lander for Investigating Moon|SLIM]], [[Martian Moons Explorer|MMX]], [[DESTINY PLUS|DESTINY<sup>+</sup>]]<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[PLANET-B]], [[SELENE]], [[MUSES-C]]<br />\n'''Cancelled:''' [[LUNAR-A]]\n\n=== Small body exploration: Hayabusa mission ===\n{{See also|Hayabusa 2}}\n[[File:Hayabusa hover.jpg|thumb|[[Hayabusa]]]]\nOn 9 May 2003, [[Hayabusa]] (meaning, [[Peregrine falcon]]), was launched from an [[M-V]] rocket. The goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small [[near-Earth asteroid]] named [[25143 Itokawa]]. The craft [[space rendezvous|rendezvoused]] with the asteroid in September 2005. It was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in November 2005, after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data. Hayabusa returned to Earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 June 2010.\n\n=== Lunar explorations ===\nAfter [[Hiten]] in 1990, ISAS planned a lunar penetrator mission called [[LUNAR-A]] but after delays due to technical problems, the project was terminated in January 2007. The seismometer penetrator design for LUNAR-A may be reused in a future mission.\n\nOn 14 September 2007, JAXA succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer ''[[SELENE|Kaguya]]'', also known as SELENE (costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle), the largest such mission since the [[Apollo program]], on an [[H-2A]] rocket. Its mission is to gather data on the [[Moon#Origin and geologic evolution|Moon's origin and evolution]].

The [[Mars]] explorer [[Nozomi (spacecraft)|Nozomi]] (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000&nbsp;km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the [[Venus]] Climate Orbiter ''[[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|Akatsuki]]'' (PLANET-C) and [[IKAROS]] solar sail demonstrator was launched by a [[H-2A]] launch vehicle.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit in 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's [[Atmosphere of Venus#Circulation|super-rotation]], a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the troposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.\n \nJAXA/ISAS was part of the international [[Europa Jupiter System Mission \u2013 Laplace|Laplace]] [[Jupiter]] mission proposal from its foundation. A Japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research Jupiter's magnetosphere, [[Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter|JMO]] (Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter). Although JMO never left the conception phase, ISAS scientists will see their instruments reaching Jupiter on the ESA-led [[Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer|JUICE]] (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission. JUICE is a reformulation of the ESA [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] orbiter from the Laplace project. JAXA's contribution includes providing components of the RPWI (Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation), PEP (Particle Environment Package), GALA (GAnymede Laser Altimeter) instruments.\n\nJAXA is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the Martian system; a sample return mission to [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] called [[Martian Moons Explorer|MMX]] (Martian Moons Explorer).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/10/national/science-health/jaxa-plans-probe-bring-back-samples-martian-moons/|title=JAXA plans probe to bring back samples from moons of Mars|date=10 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/2016/ISASnews418.pdf#page=3 |title=ISAS\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 2016.1 No.418 |publisher= [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=2016-02-04 |language=Japanese}}</ref> First revealed in 9 June 2015, MMX's primary goal is to determine the origin of the [[Martian moons]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Torishima |first=Shinya |date=June 19, 2015 |title=JAXA\u306e\u300c\u706b\u661f\u306e\u885b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30fb\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u300d\u8a08\u753b\u3068\u306f |url=http://news.mynavi.jp/series/jaxa_mars/001/ |language=Japanese |newspaper=Mynavi News |accessdate=2015-10-06 }}</ref> Alongside collecting samples from Phobos, MMX will perform [[remote sensing]] of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], and may also observe the [[atmosphere of Mars]] as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cps-jp.org/~tansa/pub/2015/2015-08-27/10_imamura/src/20150827_10_imamura.pdf |title=\u9ad8\u6642\u9593\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u89b3\u6e2c\u304c\u3072\u3089\u304f\u706b\u661f\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u6c34\u5faa\u74b0\u306e\u79d1\u5b66 |publisher=Center for Planetary Science |format=PDF |date=28 August 2015 |access-date=2016-02-04 |language=Japanese}}</ref> As of January 2016, MMX is to be launched in fiscal year 2022.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 4, 2016 |title=JAXA\u3001\u706b\u661f\u885b\u661f\u300c\u30d5\u30a9\u30dc\u30b9\u300d\u63a2\u67fb\u2026\uff12\uff12\u5e74\u306b |url =http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/20160104-OYT1T50063.html |archive-url =https://archive.today/20160104080052/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/20160104-OYT1T50063.html |url-status =dead |archive-date =January 4, 2016 |language=Japanese |newspaper=[[The Yomiuri Shimbun]] |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n{{See also|BepiColombo}}\n\n=== Solar sail research ===\nOn 9 August 2004, ISAS successfully deployed two prototype [[solar sail]]s from a sounding rocket. A clover-type sail was deployed at 122&nbsp;km altitude and a fan type sail was deployed at 169&nbsp;km altitude. Both sails used 7.5 [[micrometre|micrometer]]-thick film.\n\nISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub-payload to the [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] (ASTRO-F) mission on 22 February 2006. However the solar sail did not deploy fully. ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the [[Hinode (satellite)|SOLAR-B]] launch at 23 September 2006, but contact with the probe was lost. The [[IKAROS]] solar sail was launched on 21 May 2010. The solar sail deployed successfully. The goal is to have a solar sail mission to Jupiter after 2020.\n\n== Astronomy program ==\n{{See also|Scientific research on the ISS}}\n\nThe first Japanese astronomy mission was x-ray satellite Hakucho (Corsa-B), which was launched in 1979.

IRTS scanned during its one-month lifetime around 7% of the sky before SFU got brought back to Earth by the Space Shuttle. During the 1990s JAXA also gave ground support for the [[ESA]] [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) infrared mission.\n\nThe next step for JAXA was the [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] spacecraft, with the pre-launch designation [[ASTRO-F]]. This satellite was launched on 21 February 2006. Its mission is [[infrared]] astronomy with a 68&nbsp;cm telescope. This is the first all sky survey since the first infrared mission [[IRAS]] in 1983.\n(A 3.6&nbsp;kg [[nanosatellite]] named [[CUTE-1.7]] was also released from the same launch vehicle.)<ref>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2006-005A Akari], NSSDCA</ref>\n\nJAXA is also doing further R&D for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission, [[SPICA spacecraft|SPICA]]. This would enable a warm launch without liquid helium. SPICA has the same size as the ESA [[Herschel Space Observatory]] mission, but is planned to have a temperature of just 4.5 K and will be much colder. Unlike Akari, which had a [[geocentric orbit]], SPICA will be located at Sun\u2013Earth {{L2|nolink=no}}. The launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on JAXA's new [[H3 Launch Vehicle]], however the mission is not yet fully funded. ESA and [[NASA]] may also each contribute an instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/article/interview/no19/p4_e.html|title=JAXA - Takao Nakagawa - Dramatic Birth and Death of Stars -|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== X-ray astronomy ===\n{{See also|ASTRO-H}}\n\nStarting from 1979 with [[Hakucho]] (CORSA-b), for nearly two decades Japan had achieved continuous observation with its [[Hinotori (satellite)|Hinotori]], [[Tenma]], [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]] and [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics|ASCA]] (ASTRO-A through D) x-ray observation satellites. However, in the year 2000 the launch of Japan's fifth x-ray observation satellite, [[ASTRO-E]] failed (as it failed at launch it never received a proper name).\n\nThen on 10 July 2005, JAXA was finally able to launch a new [[X-ray astronomy]] mission named [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]] (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA, because in the five years since the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an [[x-ray telescope]]. Three instruments were included in this satellite: an [[X-ray spectrometer]] (XRS), an [[X-ray imaging spectrometer]] (XIS), and a [[hard X-ray detector]] (HXD). However, the XRS was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium.\n\nThe next JAXA x-ray mission is the [[MAXI (ISS Experiment)|Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI)]]. MAXI continuously monitors astronomical X-ray objects over a broad energy band (0.5 to 30 keV). MAXI is installed on the Japanese external module of the ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iss.sfo.jaxa.jp/kibo/kibomefc/maxi_e.html |title=MAXI:Experiment - International Space Station - JAXA |author=JAXA |accessdate=12 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521055336/http://iss.sfo.jaxa.jp/kibo/kibomefc/maxi_e.html |archivedate=21 May 2013 }}</ref> On 17 February 2016, [[Hitomi (satellite)|Hitomi]] (ASTRO-H) was launched as the successor to Suzaku, which completed its mission a year before.\n\n=== Solar observation ===\nJapan's solar astronomy started in the early 1980s with the launch of the ''[[Hinotori (satellite)|Hinotori]]'' (ASTRO-A) x-ray mission. The [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]] (SOLAR-B) spacecraft, the follow-on to the joint Japan/US/UK [[Yohkoh]] (SOLAR-A) spacecraft, was launched on 23 September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solar-b.nao.ac.jp/index_e.shtml |title=National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322214057/http://solar-b.nao.ac.jp/index_e.shtml |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=2015-07-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://solar-b.msfc.nasa.gov/|title=SSL Redirect... please wait|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> A SOLAR-C can be expected sometime after 2020. However no details are worked out yet other than it will not be launched with the former ISAS's Mu rockets. Instead a H-2A from Tanegashima could launch it. As H-2A is more powerful, SOLAR-C could either be heavier or be stationed at {{L1}} ([[Lagrange point]] 1).\n\n=== Radio astronomy ===\nIn 1998 Japan launched the [[HALCA]] (MUSES-B) Mission, the world's first spacecraft dedicated to conduct SPACE VLBI observations of pulsars, among others. To do so, ISAS set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation. The observation part of the mission lasted until 2003 and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005. In FY 2006 Japan funded the [[ASTRO-G]] as the succeeding mission.\n\n== Communication, positioning and technology tests ==\nOne of the primary duties of the former NASDA body was the testing of new space technologies, mostly in the field of communication. The first test satellite was ETS-I, launched in 1975. However, during the 1990s NASDA was afflicted by problems surrounding the ETS-VI and COMETS missions.\n\nIn February 2018, JAXA announced a research collaboration with [[Sony]] to test a [[laser communication in space|laser communication]] system from the Kibo module in late 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAXA {{!}} Laser Link Communications Technology and Kibo Cooperative Research Agreement by JAXA, Sony CSL and Sony|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2018/02/20180208_i-seep.html|website=JAXA {{!}} Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nTesting of communication technologies remains to be one of JAXA's key duties in cooperation with [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology|NICT]].\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[Reimei|INDEX]], [[QZS-1]], [[SLATS]], [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZS-2]], QZS-3, QZS-4<br />\n'''Under Development:''' ETS-IX<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[OICETS]], [[ETS-VIII]], [[WINDS]]<br />\n\n=== i-Space : ETS-VIII, WINDS and QZS-1 ===\nTo upgrade Japan's communication technology the Japanese state launched the i-Space initiative with the ETS-VIII and WINDS missions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i-space.jaxa.jp/ispace.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225200106/http://i-space.jaxa.jp/ispace.html |archivedate=25 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nETS-VIII was launched on 18 December 2006. The purpose of [[ETS-VIII]] is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an atomic clock test. On 26 December both antennas were successfully deployed. This was not unexpected, since JAXA tested the deployment mechanism before with the LDREX-2 Mission, which was launched on 14 October with the European Ariane 5. The test was successful. The mission of [[WINDS]] (Kizuna) is to create the world's fastest satellite Internet connection. WINDS was launched in February 2008.\n\n=== OICETS and INDEX ===\nOn 24 August 2005, JAXA launched the experimental satellites [[OICETS]] and [[Reimei|INDEX]] on a Ukrainian [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]]. OICETS (Kirari) is a mission tasked with tesing optical links with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) [[ARTEMIS]] satellite, which is around 40,000&nbsp;km away from OICETS. The experiment was successful on 9 December, when the link could be established. In March 2006 JAXA could establish with OICETS the worldwide first optical links between a LEO satellite and a ground station first in Japan and in June 2006 with a mobile station in Germany.\n\nINDEX (Reimei) is a small 70&nbsp;kg satellite for testing various equipment, and functions as an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] observation mission as well. The Reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase.\n\n== Earth observation programme ==\nJapan's first Earth observation satellites were MOS-1a and MOS-1b launched in 1987 and 1990. During the 1990s and the new millennium this programme came under heavy fire, because both Adeos (Midori) and [[Adeos 2]] (Midori 2) satellites failed after just ten months in orbit.\n\n'''Active Missions:''' [[GOSAT]], [[GCOM-W]], [[ALOS-2]], [[GCOM-C]], GOSAT-2<br />\n'''Under Development:''' ALOS-3<br />\n'''Retired:''' [[ALOS]]<br />\n\n=== ALOS ===\n[[File:MTSAT-1.jpg|right|thumb|MTSAT-1]]\nIn January 2006, JAXA successfully launched the [[Advanced Land Observation Satellite]] (ALOS/Daichi). Communication between ALOS and the ground station in Japan will be done through the Kodama Data Relay Satellite, which was launched during 2002. This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth Observation Mission. For missions following Daichi, JAXA opted to separate it into a radar satellite ([[ALOS-2]]) and an optical satellite (ALOS-3). ALOS 2 SAR was launched in May 2014.\n\n=== Rainfall observation ===\nSince Japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a very important issue. For this reason Japan launched in 1997 the [[TRMM]] (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons,{{specify|reason=what would those reasons be?|date=November 2017}} both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, a H-2A rocket launched the [[GPM Core Observatory]], a satellite jointly developed by JAXA and NASA. The GPM mission is the successor to the TRMM mission, which by the time of the GPM launch had been noted as highly successful. JAXA provided the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]]/Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM/DPR) Instrument for this mission. Global Precipitation Measurement itself is a satellite constellation, whilst the GPM Core Observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation. Other countries/agencies like France, India, ESA, etc. provides the sub-satellites. The aim of GPM is to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail.\n\n=== Monitoring of carbon dioxide ===\nAt the end of the 2008 fiscal year, JAXA launched the satellite [[GOSAT]] (Greenhouse Gas Observing SATellite) to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The satellite is being jointly developed by JAXA and Japan's [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]].  JAXA is building the satellite while the Ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected. Since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the world's atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe, the GOSAT may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground.  Sensors for [[methane]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]ses are also being considered for the satellite, although the plans are not yet finalized. The satellite weighs approximately 1650&nbsp;kg and is expected to have a life span of five years.\n\n=== GCOM series ===\nThe next funded Earth-observation mission after GOSAT is the GCOM ([[Global Change Observation Mission]]) Earth-observation programme as a successor to ADEOS II (Midori) and the [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, [[GCOM-W]] (Shizuku), was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The launch of the second satellite, [[GCOM-C]], is currently planned for 2017.\n\n== Satellites for other agencies ==\nFor weather observation Japan launched in February 2005 the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R ([[MTSAT|MTSAT-1R]]). The success of this launch was critical for Japan, since the original MTSAT-1 could not be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the H-2 rocket in 1999. Since then Japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its useful life term and on American systems.\n\nOn 18 February 2006, JAXA, as head of the H-IIA at this time, successfully launched the MTSAT-2 aboard a H-2A rocket. MTSAT-2 is the backup to the MTSAT-1R. The MTSAT-2 uses the DS-2000 satellite bus developed by Mitsubishi Electric.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/society/space/products/platform_b.html |title=\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb\u88fd\u54c1\u30fb\u885b\u661f\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\uff0fDS2000 |language=Japanese |publisher=Mitsubishi Electric |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822142407/http://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/society/space/products/platform_b.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}</ref>  The DS-2000 is also used for the DRTS Kodama, ETS-VIII and the Superbird 7 communication satellite, making it the first commercial success for Japan.\n\nAs a secondary mission both the MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 help to direct air traffic.\n\n== Other JAXA satellites currently in use ==\n* [[GEOTAIL]] magnetosphere observation satellite (since 1992)\n* [[DRTS]] (Kodama) Data Relay Satellite, since 2002.

Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite will be in a zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010. In 2009 Japan also plans to launch a new version of the IGS with an improved resolution of 60&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Launch schedule ===\nThe maiden flight of the [[H-IIB]] and the HTV occurred in 1 September 2009.

In Paraguay, Guarani shares joint official status with Spanish. In Colombia, the languages of the country's ethnic groups are constitutionally recognized as official languages in their territories; more than 60 such aboriginal languages exist today. In Ecuador, Spanish, [[Northern Quechua]] and [[Shuar]] are official for intercultural relations. In Peru, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages are co-official in the areas where they are predominant. There are many other languages once spoken in South America that are extinct today (such as the [[extinct languages of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River basin]]).\n\nIn Brazil, there are around 135 indigenous languages confirmed. The regions with the most speakers are northern and southern Brazil, where there is a larger concentration of native people.

In Ecuador, Spanish, [[Northern Quechua]] and [[Shuar]] are official for intercultural relations. In Peru, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages are co-official in the areas where they are predominant.

The album garnered favorable reviews,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/figure-8/elliott-smith |title=''Figure 8'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> and peaked at number 99 on the ''Billboard'' 200<ref name=\"Billboard charts\" /> and 37 on the UK Album Charts.<ref name=\"zobbel.de\" /> The album received praise for its [[power pop]] style and complex arrangements, described as creating a \"sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures\".<ref name=\"AllMusic Figure 8\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/figure-8-mw0000604250 |title=''Figure 8'' \u2013 Elliott Smith : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=Huey |first=Steve |publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to \"the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/2847/ |title=M\u00f6bius Smith |last=Smith |first=Ethan |date=April 24, 2000 |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlbum art and promotional pictures from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the ''Figure 8'' tour.<ref name=\"Gowing\" />\n\n=== 2001\u201302: Addiction and scrapped recordings ===\n[[File:Crystal Ballroom entrance - Portland, Oregon.JPG|alt=Crystal Ballroom from the street\u2014a three-story brick building with an elaborate black awning|thumb|The Crystal Ballroom music venue in Portland, Oregon. One of Smith's performances here in December 2001 drew concern from a reviewer.]]\n\nAround the time he began recording his final album, Smith began to display signs of [[paranoia]], often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went.{{sfn|Nugent|2004}} He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] was out to get him: \"Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house.\"<ref name=\"Under the Radar 1\" /> During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with [[Rob Schnapf]], but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the ''Roman Candle'' days.<ref name=\"Gowing\" /> He finally began recording a new album with only himself and [[Jon Brion]] as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album when Brion stopped the sessions because of Smith's struggle with [[substance use disorder]].<ref name=\"The Confabulators\">{{cite web |url=http://www.confabulators.com/2005/elliott-smith-lives-again-from-a-basement-on-the-hill-v2 |title=Elliott Smith Lives Again!

He later said \"There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.\"<ref name=\"Under the Radar 1\" />\n\nWhen Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives [[Lenny Waronker]] and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. Smith complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the ''Figure 8'' album. The talks proved fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life.<ref name=\"Gowing\" /> In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from [[David McConnell]] of [[Goldenboy]]. McConnell told ''Spin'' that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and [[crack cocaine|crack]] per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. [[Steven Drozd]] of [[The Flaming Lips]] and Scott McPherson of [[Sense Field]] played a few drum tracks, [[Sam Coomes]] contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSmith's song \"[[Needle in the Hay]]\" was included in [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2001 dark comedy film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' during a [[suicide attempt]] scene.

A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland's [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] expressed concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long, his face was bearded and gaunt, and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of \"memory-loss and butterfingers\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2607-elliott_smith_%281969_2003%29.html |title=Elliott Smith (1969\u20132003) |date=October 29, 2003 |website=[[Willamette Week]] |accessdate=June 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717071127/http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2607-elliott_smith_%281969_2003%29.html |archivedate=July 17, 2013}}</ref> At another performance in San Francisco that month, the audience began shouting out lyrics when Smith could not remember them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html |title=''Magnet'' Live Review: Elliott Smith |last=Stoltz |first=Peter |website=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013103320/http://magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined [[Northwestern University]]'s A&O Ball with [[Wilco]] on May 2 in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news |last=Murtaugh |first=Dan |date=February 5, 2002 |title=A&O Ball Signs on a Second Headliner |newspaper=[[The Daily Northwestern]] | url=http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/02/Campus/Ao.Ball.Signs.On.A.Second.Headliner-1909814.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100316/http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/02/Campus/Ao.Ball.Signs.On.A.Second.Headliner-1909814.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> He was onstage for nearly an hour but failed to complete half of the songs.<ref name=\"Carpenter\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/5202.html |title=05.02.02 \u2013 Riviera Theatre \u2013 Chicago, IL |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left [[Paresthesia|hand having fallen asleep]] and told the audience it felt \"like having stuff on your hand and you can't get it off\".<ref name=\"Carpenter\" /> Smith's performance was reviewed as \"undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nucomment.com/archive/issues/020521/features/wilco.html |title=NUcomment \u2013 A&O Ball: Did You Behave? \u2013 5.21.02 |last=Winn |first=Luke |website=NUcomment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029131156/http://www.nucomment.com/archive/issues/020521/features/wilco.html |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> and an \"excruciating [\u2026] nightmare\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Dombal |first=Ryan |date=March 5, 2002 |title=Shot in the Arm |newspaper=[[The Daily Northwestern]] | url=http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/03/Campus/shot-In.The.Arm-1909849.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418161539/http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/03/Campus/shot-In.The.Arm-1909849.shtml |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> A reporter for the online magazine ''Glorious Noise'' wrote, \"It would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gloriousnoise.com/2002/just_say_yes |title=Just Say Yes |last=Brown |first=Jake |date=May 3, 2002 |website=Glorious Noise |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] at a concert where [[The Flaming Lips]] and [[Beck]] were performing.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Alison |date=October 24, 2003 |title=Elliott Smith Found Dead at 34 |journal=[[The Queen's Journal]] | issue=27 |volume=131 |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol131/issue17/arts/story3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040905170843/http://www.queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol131/issue17/arts/story3 |archivedate=September 5, 2004 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and girlfriend Jennifer Chiba.

He started telling people that [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] was out to get him: \"Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label.

Smith complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the ''Figure 8'' album. The talks proved fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life.<ref name=\"Gowing\" /> In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from [[David McConnell]] of [[Goldenboy]].
