It is first mentioned in 1234 as ''Frutingen''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages there were three castles in the modern municipal border; [[Halten Castle|Halten]], [[Tellenburg Castle|Tellenburg]] and [[B\u00fcrg Castle (Frutigen)|B\u00fcrg]].  By 1260 the scattered farmers of the valley floor had formed a political and business association.  The association had its own [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] in 1263 and in 1340 it negotiated a peace with an association in the [[Obersimmental District|Obersimmental]].  In 1391, the village of Frutigen gained the right to hold the [[High, middle and low justice|low court]] in the village.  In 1400, the expanding city-state of [[Bern]] annexed the entire valley.  However, the association was powerful enough to force Bern to make concessions.  The residents of the valley were freed from the obligation to pay taxes or provide labor for local lords and their soldiers marched under their own [[banner]].  The valley held onto these freedoms until 1854.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe village church, Saint Quirinus' church, was first mentioned in 1228 as one of the twelve churches around [[Lake Thun]] in the Str\u00e4ttliger Chronicle.  However, this church was built over the foundation of an older church.  The earliest church was probably built in the 8th or 9th century above 7th or 8th century tombs.  The original church was replaced in the 11th or 12th century.  That church was rebuilt in 1421.  The current church was built on the ruins of the 1421 church following a fire in 1727.  In 1528, Bern adopted the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the Canton.  Frutigen, like the rest of the [[Bernese Oberland]], resisted the new faith, but adopted it after the Interlaken uprising was suppressed.  The large [[parish]] of Frutigen was divided several times but still includes the villages of Schwandi and Wengi which are both part of the municipality of [[Reichenbach im Kandertal|Reichenbach]].  A Roman Catholic [[parish church]] was built in 1959.  The Catholic Frutigen parish covers approximately the same area as the medieval parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe valley had always profited from trade over the [[Gemmi Pass|Gemmi]] and [[L\u00f6tschen Pass]]es.  A ''sust'' or warehouse and mountain pass way station was built in Kanderbr\u00fcck in the 16th century, though similar buildings existed since at least the Middle Ages.  During the 16th century the local economy also began to change.  Instead of raising a variety of crops, the local farmers began to specialize in raising cattle for export.  The village now had to import grain from the [[Swiss Plateau]].  Around 1850 the economy shifted again as lace and watch factories moved into the valley.  A match stick factory also opened in Frutigen in 1850.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe first mail coach between Thun and Frutigen began operations in 1814.  The [[Spiez]]-Frutigen railroad opened in 1901, followed by the [[Bern\u2013L\u00f6tschberg\u2013Simplon railway]] in 1913.  In 1917 the [[Postauto]] began regular service between Frutigen and [[Adelboden]].  The railroad and improved roads allowed industry and tourism to flourish in the municipality.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Loetschbergbahn02.jpg|thumb|Two bridges of the ''L\u00f6tschbergbahn'' train line in Frutigen]]\n\nFrutigen has an area of {{Swiss area|0563|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|0563|QUELLE}}<!--71.75 - 71.78 km2-->  Of this area, {{convert|38.4|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 53.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|19.06|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 26.6% is forested.

It is first mentioned in 1234 as ''Frutingen''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages there were three castles in the modern municipal border; [[Halten Castle|Halten]], [[Tellenburg Castle|Tellenburg]] and [[B\u00fcrg Castle (Frutigen)|B\u00fcrg]].  By 1260 the scattered farmers of the valley floor had formed a political and business association.  The association had its own [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] in 1263 and in 1340 it negotiated a peace with an association in the [[Obersimmental District|Obersimmental]].  In 1391, the village of Frutigen gained the right to hold the [[High, middle and low justice|low court]] in the village.  In 1400, the expanding city-state of [[Bern]] annexed the entire valley.  However, the association was powerful enough to force Bern to make concessions.  The residents of the valley were freed from the obligation to pay taxes or provide labor for local lords and their soldiers marched under their own [[banner]].  The valley held onto these freedoms until 1854.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe village church, Saint Quirinus' church, was first mentioned in 1228 as one of the twelve churches around [[Lake Thun]] in the Str\u00e4ttliger Chronicle.  However, this church was built over the foundation of an older church.  The earliest church was probably built in the 8th or 9th century above 7th or 8th century tombs.  The original church was replaced in the 11th or 12th century.  That church was rebuilt in 1421.  The current church was built on the ruins of the 1421 church following a fire in 1727.  In 1528, Bern adopted the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the Canton.  Frutigen, like the rest of the [[Bernese Oberland]], resisted the new faith, but adopted it after the Interlaken uprising was suppressed.  The large [[parish]] of Frutigen was divided several times but still includes the villages of Schwandi and Wengi which are both part of the municipality of [[Reichenbach im Kandertal|Reichenbach]].  A Roman Catholic [[parish church]] was built in 1959.  The Catholic Frutigen parish covers approximately the same area as the medieval parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe valley had always profited from trade over the [[Gemmi Pass|Gemmi]] and [[L\u00f6tschen Pass]]es.  A ''sust'' or warehouse and mountain pass way station was built in Kanderbr\u00fcck in the 16th century, though similar buildings existed since at least the Middle Ages.  During the 16th century the local economy also began to change.  Instead of raising a variety of crops, the local farmers began to specialize in raising cattle for export.  The village now had to import grain from the [[Swiss Plateau]].  Around 1850 the economy shifted again as lace and watch factories moved into the valley.  A match stick factory also opened in Frutigen in 1850.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe first mail coach between Thun and Frutigen began operations in 1814.  The [[Spiez]]-Frutigen railroad opened in 1901, followed by the [[Bern\u2013L\u00f6tschberg\u2013Simplon railway]] in 1913.  In 1917 the [[Postauto]] began regular service between Frutigen and [[Adelboden]].  The railroad and improved roads allowed industry and tourism to flourish in the municipality.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Loetschbergbahn02.jpg|thumb|Two bridges of the ''L\u00f6tschbergbahn'' train line in Frutigen]]\n\nFrutigen has an area of {{Swiss area|0563|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|0563|QUELLE}}<!--71.75 - 71.78 km2-->  Of this area, {{convert|38.4|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 53.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|19.06|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 26.6% is forested.

After this land was assigned to Pennsylvania by the federal government according to the placement of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], Indiana County was created on March 30, 1803, from parts of [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] and [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania|Clearfield]] counties and was formally organized in 1806.<ref name=\"counties\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/documents/PA_Individual_County_Chronologies.htm|title=Pennsylvania: Individual County Chronologies|publisher=The Newberry Library|website=Pennsylvania Atlas of Historical County Boundaries|date=2008|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIndiana County (Indiana meaning \"land of the Indians\") derives its name from the so-called \"Indiana Grant of 1768\" that the Iroquois Six Nations were forced to make to \"suffering traders\" under the [[Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768]]. The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley as their hunting grounds since the 17th century, and Anglo-American colonists were moving into the area and wanted to develop it. Traders arranged to force the Iroquois to grant land under the treaty in relations to losses due to [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].<ref name=\"anderson\">Anderson, James Donald, \"Vandalia: The First West Virginia?\" ''West Virginia History'', Volume 40, No. 4 (Summer 1979), pp. 375-92  [http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/journal_wvh/wvh40-4.html online]</ref>\n\nSome of the grantees joined forces with the Ohio Company, forming a larger development company based on enlarging their grant of land. They proposed that the entire large area would become a new British colony, possibly to be called Pittsylvania or [[Vandalia (colony)|Vandalia]]. It was to be bordered on the north and west by the [[Ohio River]], and made up of what are now parts of eastern Kentucky, northern West Virginia (then part of the Virginia Colony), and western Pennsylvania. Anglo-European colonists from Virginia and Pennsylvania had already started to move into the area, which was identified by these various names as Indiana and the other above names on some maps of the late 1700s.<ref name=\"miller\"/><ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\nOpposition from other interest groups<ref>Gipson, Lawrence Henry, ''The British Empire Before the American Revolution'', 15 vols.

Afterward, some United States speculators proposed setting up a state in this area to be called Vandalia, or Westsylvania, as appears on some maps of the period.\n\nBut both the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania claimed the land based on their colonial charters.

The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley as their hunting grounds since the 17th century, and Anglo-American colonists were moving into the area and wanted to develop it. Traders arranged to force the Iroquois to grant land under the treaty in relations to losses due to [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].<ref name=\"anderson\">Anderson, James Donald, \"Vandalia: The First West Virginia?\" ''West Virginia History'', Volume 40, No. 4 (Summer 1979), pp. 375-92  [http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/journal_wvh/wvh40-4.html online]</ref>\n\nSome of the grantees joined forces with the Ohio Company, forming a larger development company based on enlarging their grant of land. They proposed that the entire large area would become a new British colony, possibly to be called Pittsylvania or [[Vandalia (colony)|Vandalia]]. It was to be bordered on the north and west by the [[Ohio River]], and made up of what are now parts of eastern Kentucky, northern West Virginia (then part of the Virginia Colony), and western Pennsylvania. Anglo-European colonists from Virginia and Pennsylvania had already started to move into the area, which was identified by these various names as Indiana and the other above names on some maps of the late 1700s.<ref name=\"miller\"/><ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\nOpposition from other interest groups<ref>Gipson, Lawrence Henry, ''The British Empire Before the American Revolution'', 15 vols.

Afterward, some United States speculators proposed setting up a state in this area to be called Vandalia, or Westsylvania, as appears on some maps of the period.\n\nBut both the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania claimed the land based on their colonial charters.

The nature of British-Indian relationships and stigma during the colonial period often meant that many Anglo-Indians were undocumented or incorrectly racially identified during the British Raj.

The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at [[Fort St. George]]: \"Induce by all meanes you can invent our souldiers (sic) to marry with Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.\" Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\"\n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12\u201317 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=3\u201311 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=15\u201319 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nAs British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women. Intermarriage declined after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Rebellion of 1857]],<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=31\u20133}}</ref> after which several [[anti-miscegenation laws]] were implemented.<ref>{{citation|title=Converting Women|first=Eliza F.|last=Kent|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=2004|isbn=0-19-516507-1|pages=85\u20136}}</ref><ref>{{citation|doi=10.1353/dia.1996.0005|title=Review Essay: Colonial Figures and Postcolonial Reading|first=Suvir|last=Kaul|journal=[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]|volume=26|issue=1|year=1996|pages=74\u201389 [83\u20139]}}</ref> As a result, Eurasians were neglected by both the British and Indian populations in India.\n\n===Consolidation===\nOver generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. [[Anglo-Indian cuisine|Their cuisine]], dress, speech (use of English as their [[mother tongue]]), and religion ([[Christianity]]) all served to further segregate them from the native population.  A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English language school system, their Anglo-centric culture, and their Christian beliefs in particular helped bind them together.<ref name=autogenerated3>Maher, James, Reginald. (2007).

They felt a loyalty to a British \"home\" that most had never seen and where they would gain little social acceptance. (''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' touches on the identity crisis faced by the Anglo-Indian community during the independence struggle.) They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions.\n\nMany Anglo-Indians left the country in 1947, hoping to make a new life in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], such as Australia or Canada. The exodus continued through the 1950s and 1960s and by the late 1990s most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.<ref>Anthony, Frank.

There have been nine reunions, with the latest being held in 2015 in [[Kolkata]].\n\nSeveral narratives and novels have been published recently. ''The Leopard's Call: An Anglo-Indian Love Story'' (2005) by Reginald Shires, tells of the life of two teachers at the small Bengali town of [[Falakata]], down from [[Bhutan]]; ''At the Age for Love: A Novel of Bangalore during World War II'' (2006) is by the same author.

''The Hammarskjold Killing'' (2007) by William Higham, is a novel in which a London-born Anglo-Indian heroine is caught up in a terrorist crisis in Sri Lanka.

In order to encourage the integration of the community into the larger society, the government stipulates that a certain percentage of the student body come from other Indian communities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\nIn a 2013 [[BBC News]] feature on Anglo-Indians, journalist [[Kris Griffiths]] wrote: \"It has been noted in recent years that the number of Anglo-Indians who have succeeded in certain fields is remarkably disproportionate to the community's size. For example, in the music industry there are [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] (born [[Madras]]), [[Peter Sarstedt]] ([[Delhi]]) and [[Cliff Richard]] ([[Lucknow]]).

[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Maurice Barker]] was India's first Anglo-Indian Air Marshal. At least seven other Anglo-Indians subsequently reached that post, a notable achievement for a small community.

The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India. Foremost among these is CTR (Calcutta Tiljallah Relief \u2013 based in the US), which has instituted a senior pension scheme, and provides monthly pensions to over 300 seniors.

The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\" \n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12-17 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=3-11 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=15-19 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref> \n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nAs British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women.

There have been nine reunions, with the latest being held in 2015 in [[Kolkata]].\n\nSeveral narratives and novels have been published recently. ''The Leopard's Call: An Anglo-Indian Love Story'' (2005) by Reginald Shires, tells of the life of two teachers at the small Bengali town of [[Falakata]], down from [[Bhutan]]; ''At the Age for Love: A Novel of Bangalore during World War II'' (2006) is by the same author.

The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India.

When they do get cooking, it's on extended 12-bar blues vamps in the first set like \"It Ain't No Use\" and \"Pig's Boogie\", while the second set tends toward laid-back jams like \"Catfish John\" or shuffling electric blues workouts like \"Tore Up Over You\". The band takes some time to truly get in a groove on this date, finally settling into some of the best material near the end of the recording.\"<ref name=AllMusic/>\n\nIn ''[[All About Jazz]]'', Doug Collette wrote, \"The fact of the matter is everyone in the group gets their own chance to shine, but these abbreviated solo intervals don't interrupt the seamless flow of the collective interaction....

It is the seat of the administrative district ([[gmina]]) called [[Gmina Niemcza]].\n\nThe town lies on the [[\u015al\u0119za River]], approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} east of [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w]], and {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} south of the regional capital [[Wroc\u0142aw]].\n\nFrom 1975 to 1998 Niemcza was in [[Wa\u0142brzych Voivodeship]].\n\n==History==\nNiemcza is historically one of the most important towns of Silesia.<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.361\">Weczerka, p.361</ref><ref name=\"Niemcza\">[http://www.um.niemcza.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=458&Itemid=123 \"Official website of the city]</ref> The oldest traces date back to the [[Bronze Age]]. Between 1000 and 800 B.C. people of the [[Lusatian culture]] fortified the so-called \"city hill\" and incorporated this fortification into their Silesian defence system. This fort was probably destroyed during a battle against the [[Scythian]] around 500 BC. Members of the Germanic [[Silingi]] tribe who did not participate in the [[Migration Period]] but stayed in Silesia chose the place in the 4th century as their fortified center of a Germanic settlement area between \"mons Silencii\" ([[Mount \u015al\u0119\u017ca|\u015al\u0119\u017ca]]) and the river \"Selenca\" ([[\u015al\u0119za]]).<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.361\"/> [[Slavs]] arrived after the 6th century and called this place \"Nemci\" ( = mute, metaphorically \"those who do not speak our language\").<ref name=\"Niemcza\"/><ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\">Weczerka, p.362</ref> [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] later described \"Nemzi\" as \"eo quod a nostris olim sitcondita, dicta\" (Nemzi is called like that because it is, according to reports, founded by our people).<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\"/><ref>Petry, p.76</ref> The settlement was expanded and evolved into the center of the [[\u015al\u0119\u017canie]] district.\n[[File:Niemcza, deska na n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|thumb|left|A monument commemorating the [[Siege of Niemcza|Polish defense of Niemcza]] in 1017 at the Market Square]]\nIn early times Niemcza became an important base in [[Bohemia]]s fight for Silesia. After 990 it was seized by [[Poland]] under first historic ruler [[Mieszko I of Poland]] and withstood both emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II.]] in 1017 ([[Siege of Niemcza]]) and a major offensive of Bohemia in 1093.<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\">Weczerka, p.362</ref> In 1137, the Polish and Czech rulers, [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] and [[Sob\u011bslav I, Duke of Bohemia|Sob\u011bslav I]], met in Niemcza.<ref name=UM>{{cite web|url=http://www.um.niemcza.pl/turysci/historia-2|title=Historia|website=Urz\u0105d Miasta i Gminy Niemcza|accessdate=19 October 2019|language=Polish}}</ref><ref name=MN>{{cite web|url=https://muzeumniemcza.pl/historia/kalendarium/|title=Historia / Kalendarium|website=Wirtualne Muzeum Ziemi Niemcza\u0144skiej|accessdate=19 October 2019|language=Polish}}</ref> In 1152 the overthrown Polish ruler [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]] stayed in Niemcza.<ref name=UM/> After 1155 it became the center of a [[Piast]] castellany district. This preurban civitas consisted of a settlement enclosed by imposing ramparts in [[Great Moravia|great-moravian]] design (the only one in Silesia), the castellany castle with St. Peter chapel, first mentioned in 1288/95, and a market place around St. Adalbert church, one of the oldest churches of Silesia, outside and to the west of the ramparts. The area was surrounded by several manors.\n\nThe German [[Ostsiedlung]] reached Niemcza and the surrounding area already in 1210.<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\"/> The settlement however grew only slow as the new German town was founded directly on the soil of the cramped old Polish urbs, whereas the more spacious market place around St. Adalbert was remodeled to a village. In 1282, Duke [[Henry IV Probus]] granted Niemcza [[town rights]], although it is possible that town rights were granted earlier.<ref name=UM/> Remarkable was the establishment of the parish church St. Marien, which in 1295 was assigned to both Poles and Germans for shared and separate usage. Before 1300 a new city wall was built, which is in parts preserved. At the same time the wooden castellany castle was replaced by a stone castle, and a city hall was first mentioned in 1474.\n[[File:2016 Brama Dolna w Niemczy 01.jpg|thumb|The historical fortifications and gate near the entrance to the Old Town]]\n\nWith the partition of the [[Duchy of Silesia|Duchy of Wroc\u0142aw]] in 1311 the town passed to the [[Duchy of Brzeg]]. In 1322 both the town and municipal area (Weichbild) became a pledged possession of the Duchy of \u015awidnica, whose duke [[Bolko I the Strict|Bolko I.]] used the strategic position of Niemcza in his fight against [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. In 1331 Niemcza was successfully defended during the Czech invasion of King [[John of Bohemia]].<ref name=UM/> After 1392 the duchy of \u015awidnica was dissolved, Niemcza came back to the duchy of Brzeg, which in 1419 was reunited with the [[Duchy of Legnica]] and remained under the rule of the [[Piast dynasty]] until 1675, although under Bohemian suzerainty. The [[Hussite]]s seized Niemcza/Nimptsch in 1430 and held the town for several years. After six unsuccessful sieges it was returned in 1434 and razed to the ground by the burghers of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. In 1455 duchess [[Hedwig of Legnica]] confirmed the town rights of Niemcza.<ref name=MN/>\n\n[[File:Niemcza by Werner.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Nimptsch in 1752, drawing by Friedrich Bernhard Werner]]\nIn 1481 the administration of the municipal area was moved to [[Bia\u0142obrzezie]].<ref name=MN/> Nimptsch, which was equipped below average, enclosed by noble properties, on the periphery of the municipal area, in the extreme western corner of the duchy and close to the far more successful foundations of [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w|Reichenbach]] (Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w) and [[Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie|Frankenstein]] (Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie), could never overcome such backlashes. A moderate recovery, marked by the reconstruction of the town wall, the modernisation of the,never used, ducal residence, the rebuilding of St. Adalbert as the Protestant church St. George in 1612 and the awarding of several town rights, was stopped by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the war, in 1625 a plague epidemic broke out, and in the 1630s the town was destroyed and plundered by foreign troops.<ref name=MN/> In 1635 [[Daniel Casper von Lohenstein]] was born in the residence, the only building not destroyed during this war. Only 12 out of 103 landlords of Nimpsch survived firestorm and pest. In 1642 the town hall was rebuilt.<ref name=MN/>\n\nThe slow rebuilding, with the help of immigrated Bohemians, was again stopped by several major fires, which destroyed the town hall and parts of the residence. After the extinction of the local Piasts in 1675 the [[counter-reformation]] obtained the tension-filled reestablishment of a Catholic commune. At the same time Nimptsch became a center of sacred music thanks to Protestant cantor Johann Heinrich Quiel.\n\n{{multiple image |align=right |perrow=3 |total_width=350 |header=Historic sights of Niemcza (examples)\n| image1=2016 Niemcza, pl.

Between 1000 and 800 B.C. people of the [[Lusatian culture]] fortified the so-called \"city hill\" and incorporated this fortification into their Silesian defence system. This fort was probably destroyed during a battle against the [[Scythian]] around 500 BC. Members of the Germanic [[Silingi]] tribe who did not participate in the [[Migration Period]] but stayed in Silesia chose the place in the 4th century as their fortified center of a Germanic settlement area between \"mons Silencii\" ([[Mount \u015al\u0119\u017ca|\u015al\u0119\u017ca]]) and the river \"Selenca\" ([[\u015al\u0119za]]).<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.361\"/> [[Slavs]] arrived after the 6th century and called this place \"Nemci\" ( = mute, metaphorically \"those who do not speak our language\").<ref name=\"Niemcza\"/><ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\">Weczerka, p.362</ref> [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] later described \"Nemzi\" as \"eo quod a nostris olim sitcondita, dicta\" (Nemzi is called like that because it is, according to reports, founded by our people).<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\"/><ref>Petry, p.76</ref> The settlement was expanded and evolved into the center of the [[\u015al\u0119\u017canie]] district.\n[[File:Niemcza, deska na n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|thumb|left|A monument commemorating the [[Siege of Niemcza|Polish defense of Niemcza]] in 1017 at the Market Square]]\nIn early times Niemcza became an important base in [[Bohemia]]s fight for Silesia.

This preurban civitas consisted of a settlement enclosed by imposing ramparts in [[Great Moravia|great-moravian]] design (the only one in Silesia), the castellany castle with St. Peter chapel, first mentioned in 1288/95, and a market place around St. Adalbert church, one of the oldest churches of Silesia, outside and to the west of the ramparts. The area was surrounded by several manors.\n\nThe German [[Ostsiedlung]] reached Niemcza and the surrounding area already in 1210.<ref name=\"Weczerka, p.362\"/> The settlement however grew only slow as the new German town was founded directly on the soil of the cramped old Polish urbs, whereas the more spacious market place around St. Adalbert was remodeled to a village. In 1282, Duke [[Henry IV Probus]] granted Niemcza [[town rights]], although it is possible that town rights were granted earlier.<ref name=UM/> Remarkable was the establishment of the parish church St. Marien, which in 1295 was assigned to both Poles and Germans for shared and separate usage. Before 1300 a new city wall was built, which is in parts preserved. At the same time the wooden castellany castle was replaced by a stone castle, and a city hall was first mentioned in 1474.\n[[File:2016 Brama Dolna w Niemczy 01.jpg|thumb|The historical fortifications and gate near the entrance to the Old Town]]\n\nWith the partition of the [[Duchy of Silesia|Duchy of Wroc\u0142aw]] in 1311 the town passed to the [[Duchy of Brzeg]]. In 1322 both the town and municipal area (Weichbild) became a pledged possession of the Duchy of \u015awidnica, whose duke [[Bolko I the Strict|Bolko I.]] used the strategic position of Niemcza in his fight against [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. In 1331 Niemcza was successfully defended during the Czech invasion of King [[John of Bohemia]].<ref name=UM/> After 1392 the duchy of \u015awidnica was dissolved, Niemcza came back to the duchy of Brzeg, which in 1419 was reunited with the [[Duchy of Legnica]] and remained under the rule of the [[Piast dynasty]] until 1675, although under Bohemian suzerainty. The [[Hussite]]s seized Niemcza/Nimptsch in 1430 and held the town for several years. After six unsuccessful sieges it was returned in 1434 and razed to the ground by the burghers of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. In 1455 duchess [[Hedwig of Legnica]] confirmed the town rights of Niemcza.<ref name=MN/>\n\n[[File:Niemcza by Werner.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Nimptsch in 1752, drawing by Friedrich Bernhard Werner]]\nIn 1481 the administration of the municipal area was moved to [[Bia\u0142obrzezie]].<ref name=MN/> Nimptsch, which was equipped below average, enclosed by noble properties, on the periphery of the municipal area, in the extreme western corner of the duchy and close to the far more successful foundations of [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w|Reichenbach]] (Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w) and [[Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie|Frankenstein]] (Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie), could never overcome such backlashes. A moderate recovery, marked by the reconstruction of the town wall, the modernisation of the,never used, ducal residence, the rebuilding of St. Adalbert as the Protestant church St. George in 1612 and the awarding of several town rights, was stopped by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the war, in 1625 a plague epidemic broke out, and in the 1630s the town was destroyed and plundered by foreign troops.<ref name=MN/> In 1635 [[Daniel Casper von Lohenstein]] was born in the residence, the only building not destroyed during this war. Only 12 out of 103 landlords of Nimpsch survived firestorm and pest. In 1642 the town hall was rebuilt.<ref name=MN/>\n\nThe slow rebuilding, with the help of immigrated Bohemians, was again stopped by several major fires, which destroyed the town hall and parts of the residence. After the extinction of the local Piasts in 1675 the [[counter-reformation]] obtained the tension-filled reestablishment of a Catholic commune. At the same time Nimptsch became a center of sacred music thanks to Protestant cantor Johann Heinrich Quiel.\n\n{{multiple image |align=right |perrow=3 |total_width=350 |header=Historic sights of Niemcza (examples)\n| image1=2016 Niemcza, pl.

The parties agreed to [[arbitration]], which found that Gwynneth, as executor, owed a further \u00a3500 over and above \u00a3500 which Dame Margery had already received. This was then reduced to \u00a3400 by taking into account \u00a3100 which she and George Rolle had taken upon a bond from the children's portions deposited for them by Gwynneth in the Chamber of London, and which had not been repaid. Gwynneth made a payment and was granted his release or acquittance by the arbitrators. \n\nChamberlayne, however, pressed his bill, and Gwynneth then brought the matter to a perfect issue. He objected that Rolle's bond was nothing to do with Chamberlayne's suit, had not been mentioned in arbitration, and was never a subject of dispute. He revealed and proved that he had paid the full \u00a3500 before receiving his acquittance. He thereby exonerated himself from any possible imputation that he had used the children's money to discharge what he owed to Dame Margery. Her obligation, on the other hand, still remained. By a final and definitive sentence in Chancery on 4 November 1556 he was completely discharged and awarded costs, and Chamberlayne's bill was dismissed.<ref>The National Archives (UK), Chancery, Pleadings: ''Chamberlayn v Guyneth'', [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7501237 C 1/1339/16-20], and C 18/10/26; Final decree: ''Chamberlayne v Gwnyneth'' [''[[sic]]'', recte Gwyneth], ref.

The parties agreed to [[arbitration]], which found that Gwynneth, as executor, owed a further \u00a3500 over and above \u00a3500 which Dame Margery had already received. This was then reduced to \u00a3400 by taking into account \u00a3100 which she and George Rolle had taken upon a bond from the children's portions deposited for them by Gwynneth in the Chamber of London, and which had not been repaid. Gwynneth made a payment and was granted his release or acquittance by the arbitrators. \n\nChamberlayne, however, pressed his bill, and Gwynneth then brought the matter to a perfect issue. He objected that Rolle's bond was nothing to do with Chamberlayne's suit, had not been mentioned in arbitration, and was never a subject of dispute. He revealed and proved that he had paid the full \u00a3500 before receiving his acquittance. He thereby exonerated himself from any possible imputation that he had used the children's money to discharge what he owed to Dame Margery. Her obligation, on the other hand, still remained. By a final and definitive sentence in Chancery on 4 November 1556 he was completely discharged and awarded costs, and Chamberlayne's bill was dismissed.<ref>The National Archives (UK), Chancery, Pleadings: ''Chamberlayn v Guyneth'', [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7501237 C 1/1339/16-20], and C 18/10/26; Final decree: ''Chamberlayne v Gwnyneth'' [''[[sic]]'', recte Gwyneth], ref.

{"title_page": "Prehistory of Brittany", "text_new": "[[File:Carnac Kermario 07.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Carnac stones|alignments of Carnac]], the largest collection of megaliths in the world, demonstrate the organisation of Neolithic culture in Brittany]]\nThis page concerns the [[prehistory]] of [[Brittany]].\n\n==Palaeolithic==\nBrittany was never [[glaciation|glaciated]] during the [[Quaternary]], owing to its latitude, proximity to the coast and absence of significant mountain ranges. However, even though free of glaciers, Palaeolithic Brittany was extremely cold compared to its present climate, with annual mean temperatures at the last glacial maximum estimated at -3&nbsp;\u00b0C (27&nbsp;\u00b0F). [[Permafrost]] was present with only a very shallow active layer estimated at only 1 foot (30&nbsp;cm) thawing each summer, so that only a very light (less than 5 percent) cover of [[tundra]] could grow. This vegetation could only support very low densities of grazing mammals like [[reindeer]], which (in Europe) are found today only in areas then uninhabitable due to the presence of thick [[ice sheet]]s.\n\nConsequently, few if any people could survive in Brittany prior to the end of the last glaciation, and only a few Palaeolithic sites are known from Brittany, like the rock shelter of [[Perros-Guirec]] near [[Rochworn]]. The only cave site known so far is Roc'h Toul  in a sandstone promontory near Guiclan ([[Finist\u00e8re]]). The cave contained about 200 artifacts and was dated to the late [[Magdalenian]] by [[Gabriel de Mortillet|de Mortillet]]. Because of the presence of points with curved backs, it is now connected with the [[epipalaeolithic]] [[Azilian]]. Other Azilian sites include Parc-an-Plenen and Enez Guennoc.\n\n==Mesolithic==\nThe best-known [[mesolithic]] sites from Brittany are the cemeteries on the islands of [[Ho\u00ebdic]] (10 graves) and [[T\u00e9viec]] (9 graves) in [[Morbihan]]. The collective graves are placed in [[shell midden]]s without any particular order. Some graves show evidence of postmortal manipulations of the bones. There are single burials and empty graves ([[cenotaph]]s) as well. The graves are covered with stones, a [[hearth]] or [[antler]]s forming a sort of dome. Rich funeral gifts, [[flint tools]], engraved bones, shell ornaments and [[ochre]] demonstrate the affluence of these [[hunter-gatherers]], or rather fisher-gatherers. Certain shells are sex-specific.\n\nIn Teviec there are stone [[cist]] graves. The bones of an infant have been postmortally ornamented with striations.\n\nThe corresponding settlements consist of shell middens. A [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon date]] of 4625 (uncal.) for Ho\u00ebdic places it in the 6th Millennium BC cal, rather late in the Mesolithic sequence, and indeed there are some indications of contact with agricultural societies to the East. Their economy was based on marine resources. Recently, a number of [[accelerator (chemistry)|accelerator]] dates have been published for Ho\u00ebdic.\n\nIn [[Beg an Dorchenn]] in Plomeur (Finist\u00e8re), domestic dog and cattle were already present, in [[Dissignac]], [[microlith]]s were associated with [[pollen]] evidence for [[forest clearance|clearance]]s.\n\nSome scholars speculate that megalithic graves might go back to the Mesolithic, but this contention is difficult to prove, as most structures have been reused. Large numbers of microliths have been found under the [[chambered tomb]] of Dissignac [[:fr:Tumulus de Dissignac]].\n\n==Neolithic==\n[[File:Kerloas menhir.JPG|thumb|The Kerloas Menhir, near Plouarzel. With a height of 9.5 metres this menhir is the tallest standing menhir in Brittany. A few centuries ago the top was knocked off in a thunder storm: originally it must have been over 10 metres high.]]\nThe westernmost extensions of the [[Villeneuve-Saint-Germain culture]], based on a [[linearbandkeramic]] tradition are found in eastern Brittany at Le Haut Me\u00e9. The use of [[schist]] from the eastern edge of the Breton Massif for bracelets in settlements in the Paris Bassin attests to widespread trade. A bracelet of polished stone found in a grave in the VSG-settlement of [[Jablines]] Les-Longues-Raies was made of [[amphibolite]] from the island of [[Groix]] in southern Morbihan, proves  trade with local [[Mesolithic]] communities.\n\nThe earliest long mounds date to the mid-5th millennium ([[Barnenez]]). The early [[passage grave]]s generally date to between 4000 and 3000 bc, followed by evolved passage graves between 3000-2500 bc. In the later part of the Neolithic, [[all\u00e9e couverte|all\u00e9es couvertes]] and simple [[dolmen]]s became the predominant type of burial monument.\nSome passage graves are decorated with incised lines, of which [[Gavrinis]] is probably the best known example.\n\nSome scholars see an influence of the central European [[Linear band ceramic]] culture in the finds from the longbarrows of [[Man\u00e9 Ty Ec]] and [[Man\u00e9 Pochat er Ieu]] ([[Morbihan]]), but this should rather be connected to the [[la Hoguette]] tradition, ultimately of [[Cardial Ware|Cardial]] extraction.\n\nCarn-pottery, thin walled round based deep bowls, often with applied crescents (croissants) is typical for early [[chambered tomb]]s. It is found in Finist\u00e8re, Morbihan and [[Loire-Atlantique]].\n\nMiddle Neolithic settlements include La Motte, La Butte-aux-Pierres and Lannic. They mainly concentrate on the Coast. The pottery shows [[Chass\u00e9en]] influences. Bowls are still round-bottomed, but with s-shaped profiles and vertically perforated [[Lug (knob)|lug]]s. Some geometric decoration occurs, but is rather rare. Vase-supports of Chassey-type are found as well, the Breton variety has been named the Er Lannic type and is characterised by triangular perforations, while the examples found in the [[Channel Islands]] show circular perforations. Other local pottery types include Castellic grooved ware, [[Souc'h-ware]], and Colpo-type ware.\n\n[[Stone circle]]s like [[Er Lannic]] (a double oval of standing stones and a ditch) sometimes contain settlement material and pottery of Chass\u00e9en-type.\n\nBy the middle of the 3rd century, the Kerugou, upper and lower Conguel and Rosmeur/Croh Coll\u00e9 types became preponderant.\n\n[[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]]-influenced pottery in central Brittany includes the Quessoy and Crec'h Quille/Le Melus types. Collared bottles can be related to the Kragenflaschenhorizont of the late TBK.\n\nFrom the late 3rd millennium, Grand-Pressigny [[flint]] was imported in some quantity. Some type of Breton axes were exported. For example, [[dolerite]] axes made at Plussulien have been found in Britain. The dolmen Man\u00e9-Lud at [[Locmariaquer]] is thought to show a picture of a boat.\n\n[[Beaker people|Beaker]] material is known from some settlement sites, for example Kastel Koz, other beakers were found in rivers. Marine beakers predominate, AOC-decoration is found in Southern Brittany. Small [[gold]] plaques are known from beaker graves, in Kerouaren a diadem has been found.\n\nThere is no indication that the beaker people already exploited the Armorican metal deposits.\n\n==Bronze Age==\nThe early [[Bronze Age]] culture is commonly believed to have grown out of Beaker roots, with some [[Wessex culture|Wessex]] and [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] influence. In the early Bronze Age, rich individual graves are found under [[tumulus|barrows]], which indicates a complete change of the social structure. The Breton barrows have been divided into two series by Cogn\u00e9 and Guiot, the first dating from 1900-1600 bc, the second to 1600-1400 bc. The barrows of the first series can be up to 50 m in diameter and 6 m high. They are found in Western Brittany, along the coast, the [[Blavet]] river and at the southern border of the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]]. A few examples have been recorded from Normandy. The barrows contain a small cairn over a stone cist, wooden coffin or dry stone structure containing the burial. Often the chambers are covered by large stone slabs. Sometimes roofed mortuary houses are found, for example at St. Jude en Bourbriac. The stone [[cist]]s can be quite large, up to 4 m long, but always only contain a single body. Grave gifts include [[amber]] beads, [[silver]] cups, gold-hilted daggers (Saint Adrien), tanged flint [[arrowhead]]s and stone [[axe]]s. Because of these rich [[grave goods]], J. Briard sees them as burials of warrior-priests. Certainly not everybody was buried in this way, but nothing is known of \"commoner-burials\", especially as bones are not normally preserved in the acidic soils of Brittany. The gold-pin decoration of the dagger hilts and the amber-beads show close connection to the Wessex-culture, but there are technical differences.\n\nThe barrow of Kernonen en Plouvorn, Finist\u00e8re, provides a good example of a rich burial of the first series.\n\nThe barrows of the second series are a bit smaller and show a more inland-distribution. They do not normally contain metal, but numerous pottery vessels, high biconical vessels, sometimes with a geometric decoration under the rim, or single four-handled undecorated pots. There seems to be no division of the grave goods by gender.\n\nGlass-beads are found in some graves, for example at Mez-Nabat, Plouhinec (Finist\u00e8re).\n\nA number of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dates]] are known from the barrows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! name of site\n! dept.\n!

Numerous hoards contain tools and weapons, but metalwork is rarely found in burials or settlements, which makes the synchronisation of hoards and settlements difficult. The Tr\u00e9boul-group of hoards is thought to be contemporaneous with the second series barrows. Decorated spear-heads, flanged axes, [[palstaves]] and long daggers are typical. The hoard from Bignan (Morbihan) contained only bronze jewellery.\n\nCoastal [[saltern]]s are known from the late Bronze Age onwards as well, for example at Curnic, Guiss\u00e9ny.\n\nPollen analysis shows that widespread clearance of the beech forests took place in the early Bronze Age. Cereal pollen have been found at Porsguen, Plouescat, for example. Domestic animals included sheep, goats and cattle, but hunting may have still provided a lot of meat. La Roche, Videlles, has still 60% wild animals among the animal bones, but it is not clear if this is typical. Carbonised remains of naked wheat and barley have been found at Ploun\u00e9our-Trez, hazelnuts and acorns were eaten as well. Flint still formed an important part of the tool inventory.\n\n[[File:Bretagne Morbihan Locmariaquer 14017.jpg|thumb|The ''Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9'' and ''Table des Marchand'' at Locmariaquer]]\n\nSome standing stones (Menhirs) and stone alignments date to the early Bronze Age, for example the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 at Locmariaquer.\n\nThe later Bronze Age sees only a slight [[Urnfield]] influence. Hoards are numerous. The Saint-Brieuc-des-Iffs phase marks the beginnings of the Atlantic bronze industries. It is succeeded by the [[carp's-tongue complex]], found in Britain and Portugal as well.\n\nThe square-socketed armorican axes turn up in [[hoard]]s in great numbers. At Maure-de-Bretagne, over 4000 axes have been found, ca. 800 at Tr\u00e9hou and Loud\u00e9ac.\n\nThe axes are mainly unused and may have been a form of ingot of primitive [[currency]]. They contain a high amount of lead or consist of pure lead and are distributed from the Iberian Peninsula to eastern Germany, Ireland and Southern Britain, with some pieces from Scotland, Poland and Switzerland. Different regional types are known: Brandivy in Morbihan, Dahouet and Plurien on the North coast, Tr\u00e9hou in Finist\u00e8re. The miniature types of Maure-de-Bretagne, Ille-et-Vilaine and Couville are typical of [[Upper Brittany]].\n\n[[Copper]] was imported from Spain as plano-convex [[ingot]]s, as  found in the [[hoard]] of Penfoul, [[Landelau]].\n\nSettlements have rarely been excavated, [[Ploubazlanec]] at the mouth of the [[Trieux]] is an example of a fortified village.\n\nThe Museum of PreHistory in Carnac has large quantities of Late Bronze Age bronze and copper artifacts from the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museedecarnac.com/protohistoire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604211819/http://www.museedecarnac.com/protohistoire.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 }}</ref>\nThis culture was a maritime trading-networked culture that included Brittany and most of the rest of France, the other [[Celtic nations]], England, Spain and Portugal.

[[Strabo]] and [[Poseidonius]] describe the Armoricani as belonging to the [[Belgae]].\n\nArmorican gold coins have been widely exported and are even found in the Rhineland.\n\n[[Salterns]] are widespread in Northern Armorica, for example at Tr\u00e9gor, Ebihens and Enez Vihan near Pleumeur-Bodou (C\u00f4tes-d'Armor) and the island of Yoc'h near Landuvez (Finist\u00e8re) of late [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] date.\n\nAn estimated  40\u201355&nbsp;kg  of salt per oven were produced at [[Ebihens]]. Each oven was  about 2 m long. The site dates to the end of the early [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] or the middle La T\u00e8ne period. Numerous [[briquetage]]-remains  have been found. At Tregor, boudins de Calage (hand-bricks) were the typical form of briquetage, between 2,5 and 15&nbsp;cm long and with a diameter between 4\u20137&nbsp;cm.\nAt the salterns at Landrellec and Enez Vihan at Pleumeur-Bodou the remains of rectangular ovens have been excavated that are 2,5\u20133 m long and ca. 1 m wide and constructed of stones and clay.\nOn the  [[Gulf of Morbihan]] about 50 salterns have been found so far. mainly dating to the final La T\u00e9ne period.\n\n:''For subsequent periods of Brittany's past, see [[Armorica]] and [[history of Brittany]].''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bowen, E.

However, even though free of glaciers, Palaeolithic Brittany was extremely cold compared to its present climate, with annual mean temperatures at the last glacial maximum estimated at -3&nbsp;\u00b0C (27&nbsp;\u00b0F). [[Permafrost]] was present with only a very shallow active layer estimated at only 1 foot (30&nbsp;cm) thawing each summer, so that only a very light (less than 5 percent) cover of [[tundra]] could grow. This vegetation could only support very low densities of grazing mammals like [[reindeer]], which (in Europe) are found today only in areas then uninhabitable due to the presence of thick [[ice sheet]]s.\n\nConsequently, few if any people could survive in Brittany prior to the end of the last glaciation, and only a few Palaeolithic sites are known from Brittany, like the rock shelter of [[Perros-Guirec]] near [[Rochworn]]. The only cave site known so far is Roc'h Toul  in a sandstone promontory near Guiclan ([[Finist\u00e8re]]). The cave contained about 200 artifacts and was dated to the late [[Magdalenian]] by [[Gabriel de Mortillet|de Mortillet]]. Because of the presence of points with curved backs, it is now connected with the [[epipalaeolithic]] [[Azilian]]. Other Azilian sites include Parc-an-Plenen and Enez Guennoc.\n\n==Mesolithic==\nThe best-known [[mesolithic]] sites from Brittany are the cemeteries on the islands of [[Ho\u00ebdic]] (10 graves) and [[T\u00e9viec]] (9 graves) in [[Morbihan]]. The collective graves are placed in [[shell midden]]s without any particular order. Some graves show evidence of postmortal manipulations of the bones. There are single burials and empty graves ([[cenotaph]]s) as well. The graves are covered with stones, a [[hearth]] or [[antler]]s forming a sort of dome. Rich funeral gifts, [[flint tools]], engraved bones, shell ornaments and [[ochre]] demonstrate the affluence of these [[hunter-gatherers]], or rather fisher-gatherers. Certain shells are sex-specific.\n\nIn Teviec there are stone [[cist]] graves. The bones of an infant have been postmortally ornamented with striations.\n\nThe corresponding settlements consist of shell middens. A [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon date]] of 4625 (uncal.) for Ho\u00ebdic places it in the 6th Millennium BC cal, rather late in the Mesolithic sequence, and indeed there are some indications of contact with agricultural societies to the East. Their economy was based on marine resources. Recently, a number of [[accelerator (chemistry)|accelerator]] dates have been published for Ho\u00ebdic.\n\nIn [[Beg an Dorchenn]] in Plomeur (Finist\u00e8re), domestic dog and cattle were already present, in [[Dissignac]], [[microlith]]s were associated with [[pollen]] evidence for [[forest clearance|clearance]]s.\n\nSome scholars speculate that megalithic graves might go back to the Mesolithic, but this contention is difficult to prove, as most structures have been reused. Large numbers of microliths have been found under the [[chambered tomb]] of Dissignac [[:fr:Tumulus de Dissignac]].\n\n==Neolithic==\n[[File:Kerloas menhir.JPG|thumb|The Kerloas Menhir, near Plouarzel. With a height of 9.5 metres this menhir is the tallest standing menhir in Brittany. A few centuries ago the top was knocked off in a thunder storm: originally it must have been over 10 metres high.]]\nThe westernmost extensions of the [[Villeneuve-Saint-Germain culture]], based on a [[linearbandkeramic]] tradition are found in eastern Brittany at Le Haut Me\u00e9. The use of [[schist]] from the eastern edge of the Breton Massif for bracelets in settlements in the Paris Bassin attests to widespread trade. A bracelet of polished stone found in a grave in the VSG-settlement of [[Jablines]] Les-Longues-Raies was made of [[amphibolite]] from the island of [[Groix]] in southern Morbihan, proves  trade with local [[Mesolithic]] communities.\n\nThe earliest long mounds date to the mid-5th millennium ([[Barnenez]]). The early [[passage grave]]s generally date to between 4000 and 3000 bc, followed by evolved passage graves between 3000-2500 bc. In the later part of the Neolithic, [[all\u00e9e couverte|all\u00e9es couvertes]] and simple [[dolmen]]s became the predominant type of burial monument.\nSome passage graves are decorated with incised lines, of which [[Gavrinis]] is probably the best known example.\n\nSome scholars see an influence of the central European [[Linear band ceramic]] culture in the finds from the longbarrows of [[Man\u00e9 Ty Ec]] and [[Man\u00e9 Pochat er Ieu]] ([[Morbihan]]), but this should rather be connected to the [[la Hoguette]] tradition, ultimately of [[Cardial Ware|Cardial]] extraction.\n\nCarn-pottery, thin walled round based deep bowls, often with applied crescents (croissants) is typical for early [[chambered tomb]]s. It is found in Finist\u00e8re, Morbihan and [[Loire-Atlantique]].\n\nMiddle Neolithic settlements include La Motte, La Butte-aux-Pierres and Lannic. They mainly concentrate on the Coast. The pottery shows [[Chass\u00e9en]] influences. Bowls are still round-bottomed, but with s-shaped profiles and vertically perforated [[Lug (knob)|lug]]s. Some geometric decoration occurs, but is rather rare. Vase-supports of Chassey-type are found as well, the Breton variety has been named the Er Lannic type and is characterised by triangular perforations, while the examples found in the [[Channel Islands]] show circular perforations. Other local pottery types include Castellic grooved ware, [[Souc'h-ware]], and Colpo-type ware.\n\n[[Stone circle]]s like [[Er Lannic]] (a double oval of standing stones and a ditch) sometimes contain settlement material and pottery of Chass\u00e9en-type.\n\nBy the middle of the 3rd century, the Kerugou, upper and lower Conguel and Rosmeur/Croh Coll\u00e9 types became preponderant.\n\n[[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]]-influenced pottery in central Brittany includes the Quessoy and Crec'h Quille/Le Melus types. Collared bottles can be related to the Kragenflaschenhorizont of the late TBK.\n\nFrom the late 3rd millennium, Grand-Pressigny [[flint]] was imported in some quantity. Some type of Breton axes were exported. For example, [[dolerite]] axes made at Plussulien have been found in Britain. The dolmen Man\u00e9-Lud at [[Locmariaquer]] is thought to show a picture of a boat.\n\n[[Beaker people|Beaker]] material is known from some settlement sites, for example Kastel Koz, other beakers were found in rivers. Marine beakers predominate, AOC-decoration is found in Southern Brittany. Small [[gold]] plaques are known from beaker graves, in Kerouaren a diadem has been found.\n\nThere is no indication that the beaker people already exploited the Armorican metal deposits.\n\n==Bronze age==\nThe early [[Bronze age]] culture is commonly believed to have grown out of Beaker roots, with some [[Wessex culture|Wessex]] and [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] influence. In the early Bronze Age, rich individual graves are found under [[tumulus|barrows]], which indicates a complete change of the social structure. The Breton barrows have been divided into two series by Cogn\u00e9 and Guiot, the first dating from 1900-1600 bc, the second to 1600-1400 bc. The barrows of the first series can be up to 50 m in diameter and 6 m high. They are found in Western Brittany, along the coast, the [[Blavet]] river and at the southern border of the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]]. A few examples have been recorded from Normandy. The barrows contain a small cairn over a stone cist, wooden coffin or dry stone structure containing the burial. Often the chambers are covered by large stone slabs. Sometimes roofed mortuary houses are found, for example at St. Jude en Bourbriac. The stone [[cist]]s can be quite large, up to 4 m long, but always only contain a single body. Grave gifts include [[amber]] beads, [[silver]] cups, gold-hilted daggers (Saint Adrien), tanged flint [[arrowhead]]s and stone [[axe]]s. Because of these rich [[grave goods]], J. Briard sees them as burials of warrior-priests. Certainly not everybody was buried in this way, but nothing is known of \"commoner-burials\", especially as bones are not normally preserved in the acidic soils of Brittany. The gold-pin decoration of the dagger hilts and the amber-beads show close connection to the Wessex-culture, but there are technical differences.\n\nThe barrow of Kernonen en Plouvorn, Finist\u00e8re, provides a good example of a rich burial of the first series.\n\nThe barrows of the second series are a bit smaller and show a more inland-distribution. They do not normally contain metal, but numerous pottery vessels, high biconical vessels, sometimes with a geometric decoration under the rim, or single four-handled undecorated pots. There seems to be no division of the grave goods by gender.\n\nGlass-beads are found in some graves, for example at Mez-Nabat, Plouhinec (Finist\u00e8re).\n\nA number of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dates]] are known from the barrows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! name of site\n! dept.\n!

Numerous hoards contain tools and weapons, but metalwork is rarely found in burials or settlements, which makes the synchronisation of hoards and settlements difficult. The Tr\u00e9boul-group of hoards is thought to be contemporaneous with the second series barrows. Decorated spear-heads, flanged axes, [[palstaves]] and long daggers are typical. The hoard from Bignan (Morbihan) contained only bronze jewellery.\n\nCoastal [[saltern]]s are known from the late Bronze Age onwards as well, for example at Curnic, Guiss\u00e9ny.\n\nPollen analysis shows that widespread clearance of the beech forests took place in the early Bronze Age. Cereal pollen have been found at Porsguen, Plouescat, for example. Domestic animals included sheep, goats and cattle, but hunting may have still provided a lot of meat. La Roche, Videlles, has still 60% wild animals among the animal bones, but it is not clear if this is typical. Carbonised remains of naked wheat and barley have been found at Ploun\u00e9our-Trez, hazelnuts and acorns were eaten as well. Flint still formed an important part of the tool inventory.\n\n[[File:Bretagne Morbihan Locmariaquer 14017.jpg|thumb|The ''Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9'' and ''Table des Marchand'' at Locmariaquer]]\n\nSome standing stones (Menhirs) and stone alignments date to the early Bronze Age, for example the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 at Locmariaquer.\n\nThe later Bronze Age sees only a slight [[Urnfield]] influence. Hoards are numerous. The Saint-Brieuc-des-Iffs phase marks the beginnings of the Atlantic bronze industries. It is succeeded by the [[carp's-tongue complex]], found in Britain and Portugal as well.\n\nThe square-socketed armorican axes turn up in [[hoard]]s in great numbers. At Maure-de-Bretagne, over 4000 axes have been found, ca. 800 at Tr\u00e9hou and Loud\u00e9ac.\n\nThe axes are mainly unused and may have been a form of ingot of primitive [[currency]]. They contain a high amount of lead or consist of pure lead and are distributed from the Iberian Peninsula to eastern Germany, Ireland and Southern Britain, with some pieces from Scotland, Poland and Switzerland. Different regional types are known: Brandivy in Morbihan, Dahouet and Plurien on the North coast, Tr\u00e9hou in Finist\u00e8re. The miniature types of Maure-de-Bretagne, Ille-et-Vilaine and Couville are typical of [[Upper Brittany]].\n\n[[Copper]] was imported from Spain as plano-convex [[ingot]]s, as  found in the [[hoard]] of Penfoul, [[Landelau]].\n\nSettlements have rarely been excavated, [[Ploubazlanec]] at the mouth of the [[Trieux]] is an example of a fortified village.\n\nThe Museum of PreHistory in Carnac has large quantities of Late Bronze Age bronze and copper artifacts from the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museedecarnac.com/protohistoire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604211819/http://www.museedecarnac.com/protohistoire.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 }}</ref>\nThis culture was a maritime trading-networked culture that included Brittany and most of the rest of France, the other [[Celtic nations]], England, Spain and Portugal.

[[Strabo]] and [[Poseidonius]] describe the Armoricani as belonging to the [[Belgae]].\n\nArmorican gold coins have been widely exported and are even found in the Rhineland.\n\n[[Salterns]] are widespread in Northern Armorica, for example at Tr\u00e9gor, Ebihens and Enez Vihan near Pleumeur-Bodou (C\u00f4tes-d'Armor) and the island of Yoc'h near Landuvez (Finist\u00e8re) of late [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] date.\n\nAn estimated  40\u201355&nbsp;kg  of salt per oven were produced at [[Ebihens]]. Each oven was  about 2 m long. The site dates to the end of the early [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] or the middle La T\u00e8ne period. Numerous [[briquetage]]-remains  have been found. At Tregor, boudins de Calage (hand-bricks) were the typical form of briquetage, between 2,5 and 15&nbsp;cm long and with a diameter between 4\u20137&nbsp;cm.\nAt the salterns at Landrellec and Enez Vihan at Pleumeur-Bodou the remains of rectangular ovens have been excavated that are 2,5\u20133 m long and ca. 1 m wide and constructed of stones and clay.\nOn the  [[Gulf of Morbihan]] about 50 salterns have been found so far. mainly dating to the final La T\u00e9ne period.\n\n:''For subsequent periods of Brittany's past, see [[Armorica]] and [[history of Brittany]].''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bowen, E.
