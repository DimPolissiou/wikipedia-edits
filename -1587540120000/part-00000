He claims to be of Berber ancestry. During the Nazi occupation of Tunisia, Memmi was imprisoned in a forced labor camp from which he later escaped.<ref>\"The Colonizer and the Colonized,\" back cover material</ref>\n\nMemmi was educated in French primary schools, and continued on to the Carnot high school in [[Tunis]], the [[University of Algiers]] where he studied [[philosophy]], and finally the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. Albert Memmi found himself at the crossroads of three cultures, and based his work on the difficulty of finding a balance between the East and the West.<ref>Kabanda, Th\u00e9ophiste. \"La Permanence de l'exil dans le roman francophone.\" ''Nouvelles \u00e9tudes francophones.'' 1:24, 2009.</ref>\n\nParallel with his literary work, he pursued a career as a teacher, first as a teacher at the Carnot high school in Tunis (1953) and later in France (where he remained after Tunisian independence) at the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]], at the [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes commerciales]] in Paris and at the [[University of Nanterre]] (1970).\n\nAlthough he supported the independence movement in Tunisia, he was not able to find a place in the new Muslim state both because of his French education and his Jewish faith, and following independence he \"was asked to leave\" the new state.<ref>Martinot, Introduction to \"Racism,\" at xvi</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nMemmi's well-regarded first novel, ''La statue de sel'' (translated as ''The Pillar of Salt''), was published in 1953 with a preface by [[Albert Camus]] and was awarded the [[F\u00e9n\u00e9on Prize]] in 1954.<ref name=encyclopedia>Brennan, Carol, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/albert-memmi \"Memmi, Albert 1920\u2013\"], Contemporary Black Biography. ''Encyclopedia.com''.</ref>  His other novels include ''Agar'' (translated as ''Strangers''), ''Le Scorpion'' (''The Scorpion''), and ''Le Desert'' (''The Desert'').\n\nHis best-known non-fiction work is ''[[The Colonizer and the Colonized]]'', about the interdependent relationship of the two groups.  It was published in 1957, a time when many national liberation movements were active.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote the preface.  The work is often read in conjunction with [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''Les damn\u00e9s de la Terre'' (''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'') and ''Peau noire, masques blancs'' (''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'') and [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]]'s ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]''. In October 2006, Memmi's follow-up to this work, entitled ''Decolonization and the Decolonized'', was published. In this book, Memmi suggests that in the wake of global decolonization, the suffering of former colonies cannot be attributed to the former colonizers, but to the corrupt leaders and governments that control these states.\n\nMemmi's related sociological works include ''Dominated Man'', ''Dependence'', and ''Racism''.\n\nSean P. Hier, in a review of Memmi's ''Racism'', calls it \"well-written and autobiographically informed.\" He writes that Memmi's main claim is that racism is a \"'lived experience' arising within human situations which only secondarily become 'social experiences.' According to Hier, Memmi writes that racism is \"endemic to collective human existence.\"<ref name=\"Hier2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Hier|first1=Sean P.|title=Racism|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|date=2001|volume=26|issue=1|page=127|doi=10.2307/3341517|jstor=3341517}}</ref>\n\nMemmi has also written extensively on [[Judaism]], including ''Portrait of a Jew'', ''Liberation of the Jew'' and ''Jews and Arabs''.\n\nHe is also known for the ''Anthology of Maghrebian literature'' (written in collaboration) published in 1965 (vol. 1) and 1969 (vol. 2).\n\nReviewing Memmi's fiction, scholar Judith Roumani asserts that the Tunisian writer's work \"reveals the same philosophical evolution over time from his original viewpoints to less radical but perhaps more realistic positions.\" She concludes that \"his latest fiction is certainly more innovative and different than his earlier work.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Albert Memmi by Judith Roumani | journal = Research in African Literatures | year = 1989 | first = Hedi | last = Bouraoui | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 126\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Memmi said of his own work: \"All of my work has been in sum an inventory of my attachments; all of my work has been, it should be understood, a constant revolt against my attachments; all of my work, for certain, has been an attempt at...reconciliation between the different parts of myself.\"\n\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== French ===\n* ''\u00c0 contre-courants''.

He claims to be of Berber ancestry. During the Nazi occupation of Tunisia, Memmi was imprisoned in a forced labor camp from which he later escaped.<ref>\"The Colonizer and the Colonized,\" back cover material</ref>\n\nMemmi was educated in French primary schools, and continued on to the Carnot high school in [[Tunis]], the [[University of Algiers]] where he studied [[philosophy]], and finally the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. Albert Memmi found himself at the crossroads of three cultures, and based his work on the difficulty of finding a balance between the East and the West.<ref>Kabanda, Th\u00e9ophiste. \"La Permanence de l'exil dans le roman francophone.\" ''Nouvelles \u00e9tudes francophones.'' 1:24, 2009.</ref>\n\nParallel with his literary work, he pursued a career as a teacher, first as a teacher at the Carnot high school in Tunis (1953) and later in France (where he remained after Tunisian independence) at the Practical School of Higher Studies, at the [[HEC Paris|HEC]] High School in Paris and at the [[University of Nanterre]] (1970).\n\nAlthough he supported the independence movement in Tunisia, he was not able to find a place in the new Muslim state both because of his French education and his Jewish faith, and following independence he \"was asked to leave\" the new state.<ref>Martinot, Introduction to \"Racism,\" at xvi</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nMemmi's well-regarded first novel, ''La statue de sel'' (translated as ''The Pillar of Salt''), was published in 1953 with a preface by [[Albert Camus]] and was awarded the [[F\u00e9n\u00e9on Prize]] in 1954.<ref name=encyclopedia>Brennan, Carol, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/albert-memmi \"Memmi, Albert 1920\u2013\"], Contemporary Black Biography. ''Encyclopedia.com''.</ref>  His other novels include ''Agar'' (translated as ''Strangers''), ''Le Scorpion'' (''The Scorpion''), and ''Le Desert'' (''The Desert'').\n\nHis best-known non-fiction work is ''[[The Colonizer and the Colonized]]'', about the interdependent relationship of the two groups.  It was published in 1957, a time when many national liberation movements were active.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote the preface.  The work is often read in conjunction with [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''Les damn\u00e9s de la Terre'' (''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'') and ''Peau noire, masques blancs'' (''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'') and [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]]'s ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]''. In October 2006, Memmi's follow-up to this work, entitled ''Decolonization and the Decolonized'', was published. In this book, Memmi suggests that in the wake of global decolonization, the suffering of former colonies cannot be attributed to the former colonizers, but to the corrupt leaders and governments that control these states.\n\nMemmi's related sociological works include ''Dominated Man'', ''Dependence'', and ''Racism''.\n\nSean P. Hier, in a review of Memmi's ''Racism'', calls it \"well-written and autobiographically informed.\" He writes that Memmi's main claim is that racism is a \"'lived experience' arising within human situations which only secondarily become 'social experiences.' According to Hier, Memmi writes that racism is \"endemic to collective human existence.\"<ref name=\"Hier2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Hier|first1=Sean P.|title=Racism|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|date=2001|volume=26|issue=1|page=127|doi=10.2307/3341517|jstor=3341517}}</ref>\n\nMemmi has also written extensively on [[Judaism]], including ''Portrait of a Jew'', ''Liberation of the Jew'' and ''Jews and Arabs''.\n\nHe is also known for the ''Anthology of Maghrebian literature'' (written in collaboration) published in 1965 (vol. 1) and 1969 (vol. 2).\n\nReviewing Memmi's fiction, scholar Judith Roumani asserts that the Tunisian writer's work \"reveals the same philosophical evolution over time from his original viewpoints to less radical but perhaps more realistic positions.\" She concludes that \"his latest fiction is certainly more innovative and different than his earlier work.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Albert Memmi by Judith Roumani | journal = Research in African Literatures | year = 1989 | first = Hedi | last = Bouraoui | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 126\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Memmi said of his own work: \"All of my work has been in sum an inventory of my attachments; all of my work has been, it should be understood, a constant revolt against my attachments; all of my work, for certain, has been an attempt at...reconciliation between the different parts of myself.\"\n\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== French ===\n* ''A contre-courants''.

He also used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth''', for his ''Narrative'' of 1778.\n\n==Early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth was adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming his heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France and returned to Scotland at the time of the 1715 Rising.<ref name=monthly>\u201cMemoirs of FERDINAND SMYTH STUART, M.D., Major in the British Army, and Grandson of the Duke of Monmouth\u201d, in ''The Monthly Magazine'', 1 February 1815, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6m76vtrNAJkC&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 36\u201341]</ref> Stuart stated in 1808 that he was named after his godfather, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince  Ferdinand of Brunswick]].<ref>Ferdinand  Smyth Stuart, ''Destiny and Fortitude'' (1808) p. 42</ref> A genealogist, [[Anthony J.

According to Stuart, he later studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and graduated as a Doctor of Medicine.<ref name=monthly/>\n\n==Life in America==\nStuart emigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and settled near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where he practised as a physician. The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to Great Britain, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist forces]]. He served in several regiments in the rank of captain. He later wrote that at one time he commanded an armed sloop in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and at another raised a company of men for frontier work. More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAt New York, at about the end of 1777, Captain Smyth wrote his ''Narrative or Journal'' of his experiences, critical of the \u201cdeluded and mistaken\u201d rebels, which was printed in 1778.<ref>''Narrative or Journal of Capt.

In May 1779 he brought proceedings on various grounds against his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Graves Simcoe]], but they were found to be \u201cMalicious, Frivolous, Vexatious, & Groundless\u201d. Simcoe claimed that Captain Smyth \u201cavoided military service whenever possible\u201d.

The club are nicknamed the ''Rossobl\u00f9'' due to the red-and-blue striped shirts which they wear, which are also the official colours of the city.\n\nBologna were founding members of [[Serie A]] in 1929. During its history, the club has won the Italian league championship seven times, making them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league.\nThey have participated in 73 Serie A championships out of 88, currently ninth in the ranking of the highest number of appearances of the formations in the highest Italian category.\n\nBologna currently plays in [[Serie A]], the highest level of the Italian football pyramid.\n\nSince [[1927]] the team has been competing in its internal competitions in the [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], born as Stadio del Littoriale and called, from the postwar period until 1983, Stadio Comunale. The stadium can host more than 38,000 spectators.\n\n==History==\n'''Bologna Football Club''''s formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in [[association football|football]] at university in [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]]. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.\n[[File:Bologna1912.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Bologna squad from the 1912 season.]]\n\nThe club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, [[nobleman]] Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti [[cashier]], while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.\n\nOn 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against [[Virtus Bologna|Virtus]], who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9\u20131. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.\n[[File:Bologna since 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The progress of Bologna in the Italian football league structure since the first season of a unified Serie A (1929/30).]]\n\nTheir formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named ''Group Veneto-Emiliano''. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.\n\n===Champions: 1920s and 1930s===\nAfter the [[World War I|first war]], Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919\u201320, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2\u20131 to [[U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio|Pro Vercelli]]. They would equal this again in 1923\u201324, coming runner up to eventual national champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nBologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924\u201325, beating [[Genoa CFC]] after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928\u201329 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.\n[[File:Bologna Associazione Giuoco del Calcio 1936-37.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|1936\u201337 Italian champion Bologna.]]\n\nThe ''[[Scudetto]]'' was won by Bologna four more times before World War II, these were achieved in; 1935\u201336, [[1936\u201337 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1936\u201337]], [[1938\u201339 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1938\u201339]] and [[1940\u201341 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1940\u201341]].\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter [[World War II]], the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in [[1963\u201364 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1963\u201364]]. To date this remains their last [[Serie A]] championship, bringing the club's total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].\n[[File:Bologna Football Club 1963-64.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The last Bologna side to win the ''scudetto'', in the 1963\u201364 season.]]\n\nIt was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the [[Italian Cup]] twice, the second of which was disputed against [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The game was tense and finished 1\u20131 before going to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], where Bologna won 4\u20133.\n\n===Climbing down and back up the Leagues===\nBeginning in the 1981\u201382 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into [[Serie C1]]. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988\u201389 season after four years of fighting it out in [[Serie B]].\n\nThey did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] and playing in the [[UEFA Cup]]. The club remained in Serie A until the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] campaign, losing to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in the playoffs.\n\n====Serie B====\nDespite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from [[Serie B]] in the [[2005\u201306 Serie B|2005\u201306 campaign]]. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach [[Renzo Ulivieri]], replaced by former [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] defender [[Andrea Mandorlini]].\n\nDuring this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005\u201306 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach [[Luca Cecconi]]. For the [[2007\u201308 Serie B|2007\u201308 season]], Bologna was led by [[Daniele Arrigoni]], who helped the ''rossobl\u00f9'' achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.\n\n====Serie A====\nDuring the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A. Arrigoni was confirmed as head coach by the new group, and the start appeared to be particularly impressive, with a surprising 2\u20131 win at [[San Siro]] against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] thanks to a winning goal scored by [[Francesco Valiani]]. The next weeks saw Bologna struggling in the league, however, with eight losses in nine matches. A disappointing 5\u20131 loss to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] ultimately led the club management to sack Daniele Arrigoni on 3 November 2008 and appoint [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]] as new ''rossobl\u00f9'' boss.<ref name=\"mihajlovic_bologna\">{{Cite news|publisher=Bologna FC 1909 |url=http://www.bolognafc.it/pagen.asp?c=4915&m=11&l=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090919123831/http://www.bolognafc.it/pagen.asp?c=4915&m=11&l=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 September 2009 |title=Il Bologna a Mihajlovic |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |language=Italian }}</ref>\n\nOn 14 April 2009, [[Giuseppe Papadopulo]] was appointed as the new manager, and successfully managed to raise the team spirit avoiding relegation to Serie B only in the last match of the season. In the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|2009\u201310 season]], Bologna played in Serie A for the 65th time, and escaped relegation again despite financial issues under new head coach [[Franco Colomba]].\n\nIn June 2010, a club takeover was completed, with the club being sold by the Menarini family to [[Sardinia]]n entrepreneur Sergio Porcedda. Franco Colomba was sacked right before the [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]] opener on 29 August 2010, despite surviving relegation with the team in the 2009\u201310 season. The president of the club, Sergio Porcedda, said that the decision was made mostly \"because he [Colomba] was skeptical of the team.\"<ref name=\"bologna_news\">{{Cite news|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=818951&sec=europe&cc=5901&campaign=rss&source=soccernet|title=Bologna sack Colomba ahead of Inter game|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===The consortium \"Bologna 2010\"===\n\nOn 23 December 2010, the consortium ''Bologna 2010'' led by banker [[Giovanni Consorte]] and coffee businessman [[Massimo Zanetti]] acquired the club from Sergio Porcedda, after the latter failed to pay wages for the club during his short-tenured ownership and put Bologna in threat of bankruptcy.

For 76 days, the chairman was Marco Pavignani.\n\nFrom 7 April 2011, after the resignation of Pavignani and having paid \u20ac2.5m of capital increase, the new chairman was Albano Guaraldi,<ref>http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2011/04/08/2431298/official-bologna-appoint-albano-guaraldi-as-new-president</ref> the second largest shareholder of the consortium \"Bologna 2010\" with the 17% of the quotas, behind the outgoing Zanetti.\n\nThe 2013\u201314 season saw Bologna once again relegated to the Serie B, and also gave light to a number of financial problems involving the club and its ownership of Albino Guaraldi, who was considerably criticized by the team supporters also for a number of controversial decisions, including the sale of star player [[Alessandro Diamanti]] to Chinese club [[Guangzhou Evergrande F.C.|Guangzhou Evergrande]]. A new head coach was then found in former Cagliari boss [[Diego L\u00f3pez (footballer, born August 1974)|Diego L\u00f3pez]] for the new season, whereas Guaraldi clearly stated his intention to hand over his Bologna stakes to a new owner. A North American group headed by [[Joe Tacopina]] and [[Joey Saputo]] (owner of [[Montreal Impact]], also the team of former Bologna hero [[Marco Di Vaio]]) then stated its interest in acquiring the club; this was followed by another offer coming from former chairman [[Massimo Zanetti]]. On 15 October 2014, the board of directors ratified the sale of the club to BFC 1909 Lux SPV, and Tacopina became the new club chairman.\n\n===The consortium \"BFC 1909 Lux Spv\"===\nUnder the new ownership which BFC 1909 Lux Spv S.A.<ref>http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/panorama/2015-12-28/football-bilancio-bologna-160543.php?uuid=ACRoan0B</ref> of Luxamburg as an intermediate holding company, Bologna promoted back to Serie A in 2015. Saputo also succeeded Tacopina as the new chairman of the board of directors of Bologna on 17 November 2014.\n\nIn their first season back in [[Serie A]], Bologna finished 14th avoiding relegation.

The club are nicknamed the ''Rossobl\u00f9'' due to the red-and-blue striped shirts which they wear, which are also the official colours of the city.\n\nBologna were founding members of [[Serie A]] in 1929. During its history, the club has won the Italian league championship seven times, making them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league.\nThey have participated in 73 Serie A championships out of 88, currently ninth in the ranking of the highest number of appearances of the formations in the highest Italian category.\n\nBologna currently plays in [[Serie A]], the highest level of the Italian football pyramid.\n\nSince [[1927]] the team has been competing in its internal competitions in the [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], born as Stadio del Littoriale and called, from the postwar period until 1983, Stadio Comunale. The stadium can host more than 38,000 spectators.\n\n==History==\n'''Bologna Football Club''''s formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in [[association football|football]] at university in [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]]. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.\n[[File:Bologna1912.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Bologna squad from the 1912 season.]]\n\nThe club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, [[nobleman]] Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti [[cashier]], while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.\n\nOn 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against [[Virtus Bologna|Virtus]], who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9\u20131. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.\n[[File:Bologna since 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The progress of Bologna in the Italian football league structure since the first season of a unified Serie A (1929/30).]]\n\nTheir formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named ''Group Veneto-Emiliano''. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.\n\n===Champions: 1920s and 1930s===\nAfter the [[World War I|first war]], Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919\u201320, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2\u20131 to [[U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio|Pro Vercelli]]. They would equal this again in 1923\u201324, coming runner up to eventual national champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nBologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924\u201325, beating [[Genoa CFC]] after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928\u201329 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.\n[[File:Bologna Associazione Giuoco del Calcio 1936-37.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|1936\u201337 Italian champion Bologna.]]\n\nThe ''[[Scudetto]]'' was won by Bologna four more times before World War II, these were achieved in; 1935\u201336, [[1936\u201337 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1936\u201337]], [[1938\u201339 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1938\u201339]] and [[1940\u201341 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1940\u201341]].\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter [[World War II]], the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in [[1963\u201364 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1963\u201364]]. To date this remains their last [[Serie A]] championship, bringing the club's total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].\n[[File:Bologna Football Club 1963-64.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The last Bologna side to win the ''scudetto'', in the 1963\u201364 season.]]\n\nIt was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the [[Italian Cup]] twice, the second of which was disputed against [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The game was tense and finished 1\u20131 before going to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], where Bologna won 4\u20133.\n\n===Climbing down and back up the Leagues===\nBeginning in the 1981\u201382 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into [[Serie C1]]. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988\u201389 season after four years of fighting it out in [[Serie B]].\n\nThey did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] and playing in the [[UEFA Cup]]. The club remained in Serie A until the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] campaign, losing to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in the playoffs.\n\n====Serie B====\nDespite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from [[Serie B]] in the [[2005\u201306 Serie B|2005\u201306 campaign]]. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach [[Renzo Ulivieri]], replaced by former [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] defender [[Andrea Mandorlini]].\n\nDuring this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005\u201306 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach [[Luca Cecconi]]. For the [[2007\u201308 Serie B|2007\u201308 season]], Bologna was led by [[Daniele Arrigoni]], who helped the ''rossobl\u00f9'' achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.\n\n====Serie A====\nDuring the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A. Arrigoni was confirmed as head coach by the new group, and the start appeared to be particularly impressive, with a surprising 2\u20131 win at [[San Siro]] against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] thanks to a winning goal scored by [[Francesco Valiani]]. The next weeks saw Bologna struggling in the league, however, with eight losses in nine matches. A disappointing 5\u20131 loss to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] ultimately led the club management to sack Daniele Arrigoni on 3 November 2008 and appoint [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]] as new ''rossobl\u00f9'' boss.<ref name=\"mihajlovic_bologna\">{{Cite news|publisher=Bologna FC 1909 |url=http://www.bolognafc.it/pagen.asp?c=4915&m=11&l=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090919123831/http://www.bolognafc.it/pagen.asp?c=4915&m=11&l=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 September 2009 |title=Il Bologna a Mihajlovic |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |language=Italian }}</ref>\n\nOn 14 April 2009, [[Giuseppe Papadopulo]] was appointed as the new manager, and successfully managed to raise the team spirit avoiding relegation to Serie B only in the last match of the season. In the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|2009\u201310 season]], Bologna played in Serie A for the 65th time, and escaped relegation again despite financial issues under new head coach [[Franco Colomba]].\n\nIn June 2010, a club takeover was completed, with the club being sold by the Menarini family to [[Sardinia]]n entrepreneur Sergio Porcedda. Franco Colomba was sacked right before the [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]] opener on 29 August 2010, despite surviving relegation with the team in the 2009\u201310 season. The president of the club, Sergio Porcedda, said that the decision was made mostly \"because he [Colomba] was skeptical of the team.\"<ref name=\"bologna_news\">{{Cite news|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=818951&sec=europe&cc=5901&campaign=rss&source=soccernet|title=Bologna sack Colomba ahead of Inter game|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===The consortium \"Bologna 2010\"===\n\nOn 23 December 2010, the consortium ''Bologna 2010'' led by banker [[Giovanni Consorte]] and coffee businessman [[Massimo Zanetti]] acquired the club from Sergio Porcedda, after the latter failed to pay wages for the club during his short-tenured ownership and put Bologna in threat of bankruptcy.

For 76 days, the chairman was Marco Pavignani.\n\nFrom 7 April 2011, after the resignation of Pavignani and having paid \u20ac2.5m of capital increase, the new chairman was Albano Guaraldi,<ref>http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2011/04/08/2431298/official-bologna-appoint-albano-guaraldi-as-new-president</ref> the second largest shareholder of the consortium \"Bologna 2010\" with the 17% of the quotas, behind the outgoing Zanetti.\n\nThe 2013\u201314 season saw Bologna once again relegated to the Serie B, and also gave light to a number of financial problems involving the club and its ownership of Albino Guaraldi, who was considerably criticized by the team supporters also for a number of controversial decisions, including the sale of star player [[Alessandro Diamanti]] to Chinese club [[Guangzhou Evergrande F.C.|Guangzhou Evergrande]]. A new head coach was then found in former Cagliari boss [[Diego L\u00f3pez (footballer, born August 1974)|Diego L\u00f3pez]] for the new season, whereas Guaraldi clearly stated his intention to hand over his Bologna stakes to a new owner. A North American group headed by [[Joe Tacopina]] and [[Joey Saputo]] (owner of [[Montreal Impact]], also the team of former Bologna hero [[Marco Di Vaio]]) then stated its interest in acquiring the club; this was followed by another offer coming from former chairman [[Massimo Zanetti]]. On 15 October 2014, the board of directors ratified the sale of the club to BFC 1909 Lux SPV, and Tacopina became the new club chairman.\n\n===The consortium \"BFC 1909 Lux Spv\"===\nUnder the new ownership which BFC 1909 Lux Spv S.A.<ref>http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/panorama/2015-12-28/football-bilancio-bologna-160543.php?uuid=ACRoan0B</ref> of Luxamburg as an intermediate holding company, Bologna promoted back to Serie A in 2015. Saputo also succeeded Tacopina as the new chairman of the board of directors of Bologna on 17 November 2014.\n\nIn their first season back in [[Serie A]], Bologna finished 14th avoiding relegation.
