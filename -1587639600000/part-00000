The previous year the newly constructed Roman fleet established [[naval superiority|maritime superiority]] over Carthage. They used this advantage to invade Carthage's homeland in North Africa, modern day [[Tunisia]]. After landing on the [[Cape Bon|Cape Bon Peninsula]] and a successful campaign, the fleet returned to [[Sicily]], leaving Regulus with 15,500 men to hold the bridgehead in Africa over the winter.\n\nInstead, Regulus advanced towards the city of Carthage and defeated the Carthaginian army at the [[Battle of Adys]]. The Romans followed up and captured Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from the city of Carthage. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]], but Regulus's proposed terms were so harsh the Carthaginians decided to fight on. They gave charge of the training of their army, and eventually operational control, to the [[Sparta]]n mercenary general Xanthippus.\n\nIn the spring of 255 BC, Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 [[War elephant|elephants]] against the Romans' 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. The Romans had no effective answer to the elephants, their outnumbered cavalry was chased from the field, and most of them were surrounded and wiped out; 500 survived and were captured, including Regulus. Approximately 2,000 Romans avoided being surrounded and retreated to Aspis. The war continued for a further 14 years, mostly on Sicily or in nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory; the terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus.\n\n==Primary sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Punicus'' (or ''Poenicus''), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 c. 118 BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 167 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Bagradas River.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius' work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when Scipio led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations which featured in the events of 256\u2013255 BC.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|left|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had [[Roman expansion in Italy|recently unified mainland Italy]] south of the [[Arno]] under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly, both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 256 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}}\n\nThe Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=130}} The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their allies.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}} In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian [[quinquereme]] as a blueprint for their own ships.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}}\n\nFrustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily and naval victories at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] and [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital, Carthage (close to what is now [[Tunis]]).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=155}} Both sides were determined to establish [[naval supremacy]] and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=83}}\n\nThe Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports sailed from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] and [[Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus]].{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=434}} They embarked approximately 26,000 legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}}{{sfn|Walbank|1959|p=10}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=84\u201385}} The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar (Drepanum)|Hamilcar]], off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them.

Hamilcar and two otherwise unknown generals named Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans'.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}}\n\nThe Carthaginians established a camp on a hill near Adys.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}} The Romans carried out a night march and launched a [[Battle of Adys|surprise dawn attack]] on the camp from two directions. After confused fighting the Carthaginians broke and fled. Their losses are unknown, although their elephants and cavalry escaped with few casualties.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Carthage.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels and food ran out. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=73}} Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms: Carthage was to hand over Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]; pay all of Rome's war expenses; pay [[tribute]] to Rome each year; be prohibited from declaring war or making peace without Roman permission; have its navy limited to a single warship; but provide 50 large warships to the Romans on their request.

Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}} It is not clear how the 15,000 infantry at the Bagradas River were constituted, but they possibly represented four slightly under-strength legions: two Roman and two allied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=98}} Regulus did not attract any troops from the towns and cities rebelling against Carthage. In this he differed from other generals, including Roman ones, leading armies against Carthage in Africa. The reasons for this are not known, and his failure to make up his deficiency in cavalry in particular is puzzling.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=102}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did they fought as well armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed [[light infantry]] [[skirmisher]]s; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} The close order Libyan infantry and the citizen-militia would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Tunis.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=27}}{{#tag:ref|These elephants were typically about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-high}} at the shoulder, and should not be confused with the larger [[African bush elephant]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\n== Xanthippus ==\n[[File:Pompeii, Statuette of a war elephant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=A small, white statuette of an elephant with a mahout|{{center|Roman statuette of a [[war elephant]] recovered from [[Pompeii]]}}]]\nThe Carthaginians were recruiting fighting men from all over the Mediterranean region, and at around this time a large group of recruits from Greece arrived in Carthage.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=74}} Among them was a [[Sparta]]n, mercenary commander, [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}} Polybius notes that he had taken part in Spartan training methods and that he knew both how to deploy and how to manoeuvre an army. He made a good impression with the troops of the Carthaginian army, and was able to persuade the Carthaginian Senate that the strongest elements of their army were their cavalry and elephants and that to be deployed to best effect they needed to fight on open level ground. The historian John Lazenby speculates he may have previously faced elephants when [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] attacked Sparta in the 270s BC.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=102\u2013103}} Xanthippus was put in charge of training both the new recruits and the existing army over the winter, although a committee of Carthaginian generals retained operational control. As the prospect of a decisive battle drew nearer, and as Xanthippus's skill at manoeuvring the army became more evident, full control was given to him. Whether this was a decision of the Senate, the generals, or was forced on them by the wishes of the troops, who included many Carthaginian citizens, is not clear.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=75}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=103}}\n\n== Battle==\n\nXanthippus led the army of 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry{{snd}}the latter included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militia.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=208}}{{snd}}out of Carthage and set up camp close to the Romans in an area of open plain.

The next morning both sides deployed for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=88}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=104}} Xanthippus placed the Carthaginian citizen-militia in the centre of his formation; with the Sicilian veterans and the freshly hired infantry divided on either side of them; and with the cavalry equally divided on either side of these. The elephants were deployed in a single line in front of the centre of the infantry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=76}} The Romans placed their legionary infantry in their centre, arranged in a deeper and denser formation than usual. Polybius considered this to be an effective anti-elephant formation, but points out that it shortened the frontage of the Roman infantry and made them liable to being [[Flanking maneuver|out-flanked]]. Light infantry skirmishers were positioned in front of the legions, and the 500 cavalry were divided between the flanks.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} Regulus apparently hoped to punch through the elephants with his massed infantry, overcome the Carthaginian phalanx in their centre and so win the battle before he needed to worry about being attacked on the flanks.{{sfn|Kistler|2006|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Bagradas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|alt=A map showing the initial dispositions of the Carthaginian and Roman forces|{{center|A plan of the battle:<br>Carthaginians at top, Romans at bottom and elephants in the middle}}]]\n\nThe battle opened with attacks by the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants. The Roman cavalry, hopelessly outnumbered, were soon swept away. The Roman legionaries advanced, shouting and banging their sword hilts on their shields in an attempt to deter the elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=105}} Part of the Roman left overlapped the line of elephants, and they charged the infantry of the Carthaginian right, who broke and fled back to their camp, pursued by the Romans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=76}} This part of the Roman force probably consisted of Latin allies. The rest of the Roman infantry had difficulties with the elephants, who were not deterred by their noise but charged home, inflicting casualties and considerable confusion. At least some of the legionaries fought their way through the line of elephants, and attacked the Carthaginian phalanx. But they were too disordered to fight effectively and the phalanx held firm. Some units of the Carthaginian cavalry were now returning from their pursuit and started to attack or feint against the Roman rear and flanks. The Romans attempted to fight on all sides which brought their forward momentum to a halt.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=90}}\n\nThe Romans held firm, possibly partly because of the way their dense formation jammed them close together. However, the elephants continued to rampage through their ranks, and the Carthaginian cavalry pinned them in place by firing into their rear and flanks. Then Xanthippus ordered the phalanx to attack. Most of the Romans were packed into a space where they could not resist effectively and were slaughtered. Regulus and a small force fought their way out of the encirclement, but were pursued and shortly he and 500 survivors were forced to surrender.{{#tag:ref|Some later Roman accounts make various claims of Regulus being mistreated,{{sfn|Kistler|2006|p=100}} but Polybius does not mention this and [[Diodorus]], a writer hostile to the Carthaginians, suggests he died from natural causes.{{sfn|Hoyos|2010|p=187}}|group=note}} A total of about 13,000 Romans were killed.

The previous year the newly constructed Roman fleet established [[naval superiority|maritime superiority]] over Carthage. They used this advantage to invade Carthage's homeland in North Africa, modern day [[Tunisia]]. After landing on the [[Cape Bon|Cape Bon Peninsula]] and a successful campaign, the fleet returned to [[Sicily]], leaving Regulus with 15,500 men to hold the bridgehead in Africa over the winter.\n\nInstead, Regulus advanced towards the city of Carthage and defeated the Carthaginian army at the [[Battle of Adys]]. The Romans followed up and captured Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from the city of Carthage. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]], but Regulus's proposed terms were so harsh the Carthaginians decided to fight on. They gave charge of the training of their army, and eventually operational control, to the [[Sparta]]n mercenary general Xanthippus.\n\nIn the spring of 255 BC, Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 [[War elephant|elephants]] against the Romans' 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. The Romans had no effective answer to the elephants, their outnumbered cavalry was chased from the field, and most of them were surrounded and wiped out; 500 survived and were captured, including Regulus. Approximately 2,000 Romans avoided being surrounded and retreated to Aspis. The war continued for a further 14 years, mostly on Sicily or in nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory; the terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Punicus'' (or ''Poenicus''), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 c. 118 BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 167 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Bagradas River.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius' work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when Scipio led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations which featured in the events of 256\u2013255 BC.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|left|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had [[Roman expansion in Italy|recently unified mainland Italy]] south of the [[Arno]] under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly, both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 256 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}}\n\nThe Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=130}} The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their allies.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}} In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian [[quinquereme]] as a blueprint for their own ships.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}}\n\nFrustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily and naval victories at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] and [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital, Carthage (close to what is now [[Tunis]]).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=155}} Both sides were determined to establish [[naval supremacy]] and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=83}}\n\nThe Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports sailed from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] and [[Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus]].{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=434}} They embarked approximately 26,000 legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}}{{sfn|Walbank|1959|p=10}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=84\u201385}} The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar (Drepanum)|Hamilcar]], off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. With a combined total of about 680 warships carrying as many as 290,000 crew and marines, the battle was possibly the [[largest naval battle in history]] by the number of combatants involved.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=436}} When they met at the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]], the Carthaginians took the initiative, hoping their superior ship handling skills would tell.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=459}} After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=69}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n[[Image:First Punic War Africa 256-255BC.svg|thumb|upright=1|left|alt=a map of what is now north-east Tunisia, showing the advance, main military clashes and retreat of the invading Roman army in 256\u2013255 BC|1: Romans land and capture Apsis (256 BC)<br>\n2: Roman victory at Adys (256 BC)<br>\n3: Romans capture Tunis (256 BC)<br>\n4: Xanthippus sets out from Carthage with a large army (255 BC)<br>\n5: Romans are defeated at the Battle of Tunis.

It was expected he would achieve this by raids and by fomenting rebellion among Carthage's subject territories, but consuls had wide discretion.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=207}} Regulus chose to take his relatively small force and strike inland.{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} He advanced on the city of [[Uthina|Adys]], {{convert|60|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} south-east of Carthage, and besieged it.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} The Carthaginians, meanwhile, had recalled Hamilcar from Sicily with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hamilcar and two otherwise unknown generals named Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans'.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}}\n\nThe Carthaginians established a camp on a hill near Adys.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}} The Romans carried out a night march and launched a [[Battle of Adys|surprise dawn attack]] on the camp from two directions. After confused fighting the Carthaginians broke and fled. Their losses are unknown, although their elephants and cavalry escaped with few casualties.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Carthage.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels and food ran out. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=73}} Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms: Carthage was to hand over Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]; pay all of Rome's war expenses; pay [[tribute]] to Rome each year; be prohibited from declaring war or making peace without Roman permission; have its navy limited to a single warship; but provide 50 large warships to the Romans on their request. Finding these completely unacceptable, the Carthaginians decided to fight on.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=187}}\n\n==Armies==\n{{main|Roman army of the mid-Republic|Military of Carthage}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaries|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nMost male Roman citizens were eligible for military service, and would serve as infantry, with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}} It is not clear how the 15,000 infantry at the Bagradas River were constituted, but they possibly represented four slightly under-strength legions: two Roman and two allied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=98}} Regulus did not attract any troops from the towns and cities rebelling against Carthage. In this he differed from other generals, including Roman ones, leading armies against Carthage in Africa. The reasons for this are not known, and his failure to make up his deficiency in cavalry in particular is puzzling.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=102}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did they fought as well armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed [[light infantry]] [[skirmisher]]s; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} The close order Libyan infantry and the citizen-militia would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Tunis.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=27}}{{#tag:ref|These elephants were typically about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-high}} at the shoulder, and should not be confused with the larger [[African bush elephant]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\n== Xanthippus ==\n[[File:Pompeii, Statuette of a war elephant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=A small, white statuette of an elephant with a mahout|{{center|Roman statuette of a [[war elephant]] recovered from [[Pompeii]]}}]]\nThe Carthaginians were recruiting fighting men from all over the Mediterranean region, and at around this time a large group of recruits from Greece arrived in Carthage.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=74}} Among them was a [[Sparta]]n, mercenary commander, [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}} Polybius notes that he had taken part in Spartan training methods and that he knew both how to deploy and how to manoeuvre an army. He made a good impression with the troops of the Carthaginian army, and was able to persuade the Carthaginian Senate that the strongest elements of their army were their cavalry and elephants and that to be deployed to best effect they needed to fight on open level ground. The historian John Lazenby speculates he may have previously faced elephants when [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] attacked Sparta in the 270s BC.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=102\u2013103}} Xanthippus was put in charge of training both the new recruits and the existing army over the winter, although a committee of Carthaginian generals retained operational control. As the prospect of a decisive battle drew nearer, and as Xanthippus's skill at manoeuvring the army became more evident, full control was given to him. Whether this was a decision of the Senate, the generals, or was forced on them by the wishes of the troops, who included many Carthaginian citizens, is not clear.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=75}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=103}}\n\n== Battle==\n\nXanthippus led the army of 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry{{snd}}the latter included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militia.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=208}}{{snd}}out of Carthage and set up camp close to the Romans in an area of open plain. The precise site is not known, but it is assumed to be close to Tunis. The Roman army of about 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry advanced to meet them, and set up camp about {{convert|2|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} away. The next morning both sides deployed for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=88}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=104}} Xanthippus placed the Carthaginian citizen-militia in the centre of his formation; with the Sicilian veterans and the freshly hired infantry divided on either side of them; and with the cavalry equally divided on either side of these. The elephants were deployed in a single line in front of the centre of the infantry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=76}} The Romans placed their legionary infantry in their centre, arranged in a deeper and denser formation than usual. Polybius considered this to be an effective anti-elephant formation, but points out that it shortened the frontage of the Roman infantry and made them liable to being [[Flanking maneuver|out-flanked]]. Light infantry skirmishers were positioned in front of the legions, and the 500 cavalry were divided between the flanks.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} Regulus apparently hoped to punch through the elephants with his massed infantry, overcome the Carthaginian phalanx in their centre and so win the battle before he needed to worry about being attacked on the flanks.{{sfn|Kistler|2006|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Bagradas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|alt=A map showing the initial dispositions of the Carthaginian and Roman forces|{{center|A plan of the battle:<br>Carthaginians at top, Romans at bottom and elephants in the middle}}]]\n\nThe battle opened with attacks by the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants. The Roman cavalry, hopelessly outnumbered, were soon swept away. The Roman legionaries advanced, shouting and banging their sword hilts on their shields in an attempt to deter the elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=105}} Part of the Roman left overlapped the line of elephants, and they charged the infantry of the Carthaginian right, who broke and fled back to their camp, pursued by the Romans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=76}} This part of the Roman force probably consisted of Latin allies. The rest of the Roman infantry had difficulties with the elephants, who were not deterred by their noise but charged home, inflicting casualties and considerable confusion. At least some of the legionaries fought their way through the line of elephants, and attacked the Carthaginian phalanx. But they were too disordered to fight effectively and the phalanx held firm. Some units of the Carthaginian cavalry were now returning from their pursuit and started to attack or feint against the Roman rear and flanks. The Romans attempted to fight on all sides which brought their forward momentum to a halt.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=90}}\n\nThe Romans held firm, possibly partly because of the way their dense formation jammed them close together. However, the elephants continued to rampage through their ranks, and the Carthaginian cavalry pinned them in place by firing into their rear and flanks. Then Xanthippus ordered the phalanx to attack. Most of the Romans were packed into a space where they could not resist effectively and were slaughtered. Regulus and a small force fought their way out of the encirclement, but were pursued and shortly he and 500 survivors were forced to surrender.{{#tag:ref|Some later Roman accounts make various claims of Regulus being mistreated,{{sfn|Kistler|2006|p=100}} but Polybius does not mention this and [[Diodorus]], a writer hostile to the Carthaginians, suggests he died from natural causes.{{sfn|Hoyos|2010|p=187}}|group=note}} A total of about 13,000 Romans were killed. The Carthaginians lost 800 men from the force on their right which was routed; the losses of the rest of their army are not known.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=76\u201377}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=106}} Approximately 2,000 Romans survived, from the left wing who had broken through into the Carthaginian camp; they escaped the battlefield and retreated to Aspis.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}} This was Carthage's only victory in a major land battle during the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=88}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nXanthippus, fearful of the envy of the Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=91}} The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting [[Battle of Cape Hermaeum]] off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=438}} The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, with 384 ships sunk from their total of 464{{#tag:ref|This assumes, per G.K .

Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}} The question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and

His name is cited in the inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (as well as in the ''[[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|Res Gestae Divi Saporis]]'') and the [[Paikuli inscription]] of [[Narseh]]. Kartir also had inscriptions of his own made in the present-day [[Fars Province]] (then known as [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]]). His inscriptions narrates his rise to power throughout the reigns of Shapur I ({{reign|240|270}}), [[Hormizd I]] ({{reign|270|271}}), [[Bahram I]] ({{reign|271|274}}), and [[Bahram II]] ({{reign|274|293}}). During the brief reign of Bahram II's son and successor [[Bahram III]], Kartir was amongst the nobles who supported the rebellion of Narseh, who overthrew Bahram III and ascended the throne. During Narseh's reign, Kartir fades into obscurity, due not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.\n\n== Name ==\nKartir's name is spelled in several ways in the engravings; Middle Persian <kltyl, kltyly, krtyr, kltyr>, [[Parthian language|Parthian]] <krtyr>, [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Karteir'', and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Kardel''. The name was also used in the northeastern Iranian world, being spelt <krt'yr> in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and as ''Kirdira'' in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Biography ==\n===Under Shapur I and Hormizd I===\n[[Image:Gold coin of Shapur I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Shapur I]].]]\nKartir may have been a [[eunuch]], due to being depicted without a beard in the Sasanian reliefs.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He first appears in historical records in [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], which was most likely created between 260\u2013262. Kartir is the only religious bureaucrat mentioned in the inscription.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I, a \"lukewarm Zoroastrian\",{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} was known for his tolerance towards other religions. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, Shapur I let the [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to freely practice their religion.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} He was also friendly towards the founder of [[Manichaeism]], [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], whom he allowed to preach freely and even to be an escort in his military expeditions.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} \n[[Image:Rare coin of Hormizd I.jpg|left|thumb|Coin of [[Hormizd I]].]]\nShapur I religious practices seems to have been somewhat unusual, with animal sacrifice being made for the soul of the kings and queens of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This presumably seemed \"pagan\" to Zoroastrian priests. {{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}} Kartir, who \"abhorred animal sacrifice\" was unable to stop Shapur I from doing them.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by [[Hormizd I]], who gave Kartir clothes that were worn by the upper class, the cap and belt (''kul\u0101f ud kamarband'') and appointed him as the chief priest (''[[mobad|mowbed]]'').{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}}\n\nHormizd I died the following year; Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir, whose authority and influence had greatly increased.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} Bahram I then made a settlement with his brother [[Narseh]] to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenia]], which was constantly the subject of war between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and Sasanian Empires.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Narseh held the title of ''Vazurg \u0160\u0101h Armin\u0101n'' (\"Great King of Armenia\"), which was used by the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\n===Under Bahram I===\n[[Image:Coin of the Sasanian king Bahram I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram I]].]]\nThe previous Sasanian shahs had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. However, with Bahram I's accession to the throne, and the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed; when Mani reached the city of [[Gundishapur]], much uproar occurred, in the same fashion as [[Jesus]]' entry into [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=74}} Kartir, along with other Zoroastrian priests protested and made Bahram I have Mani imprisoned and sentenced to death in 274.{{sfn|Daniel|2012|p=61}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\nMani's death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who used the persecution of religious minorities as a method to increase and spread their vast influence.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} Mani was seen by the Zoroastrian clergy as heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan who was presenting an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism, which had been tainted by non-Zoroastrian (i.e., Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian) ideas.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid foundations to a Zoroastrian state church.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} As a result, Bahram I became applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a \"benevolent and worthy king.\"{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} His son [[Bahram II]] succeeded him as shah; he may have been aided by Kartir to ascend the throne instead of Narseh.{{sfn|Daryaee|Rezakhani|2017|p=157}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This most likely frustrated Narseh, who had now been neglected from succession several times.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\n=== Under Bahram II, Bahram III and Narseh ===\n[[Image:Silver coin of Bahram II.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram II]].]]\n[[Image:NarsehCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Narseh]].]]\nBahram II, like his father, received Kartir well. He saw him as his mentor, and handed out several honors to Kartir, giving him the rank of grandee (''[[wuzurgan]]''), and appointing him as the supreme judge (''dadwar'') of the whole empire, which indicates that thenceforth priests were given the office of judge.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}} Kartir was also appointed the steward of the [[Anahid fire-temple]] at [[Istakhr]], which had originally been under the care of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} The Sasanian kings thus lost much of their religious authority in the empire.

His name is cited in the inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (as well as in the ''[[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|Res Gestae Divi Saporis]]'') and the [[Paikuli inscription]] of [[Narseh]]. Kartir also had inscriptions of his own made in the present-day [[Fars Province]] (then known as [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]]). His inscriptions narrates his rise to power throughout the reigns of Shapur I ({{reign|240|270}}), [[Hormizd I]] ({{reign|270|271}}), [[Bahram I]] ({{reign|271|274}}), and [[Bahram II]] ({{reign|274|293}}). During the brief reign of Bahram II's son and successor [[Bahram III]], Kartir was amongst the nobles who supported the rebellion of Narseh, who overthrew Bahram III and ascended the throne. During Narseh's reign, Kartir fades into obscurity, due not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.\n\n== Name ==\nKartir's name is spelled in several ways in the engravings; Middle Persian <kltyl, kltyly, krtyr, kltyr>, [[Parthian language|Parthian]] <krtyr>, [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Karteir'', and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Kardel''. The name was also used in the northeastern Iranian world, being spelt <krt'yr> in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and as ''Kirdira'' in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Biography ==\n===Under Shapur I and Hormizd I===\n[[Image:Gold coin of Shapur I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Shapur I]].]]\nKartir may have been a [[eunuch]], due to being depicted without a beard in the Sasanian reliefs.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He first appears in historical records in [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], which was most likely created between 260\u2013262. Kartir is the only religious bureaucrat mentioned in the inscription.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I, a \"lukewarm Zoroastrian\",{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} was known for his tolerance towards other religions. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, Shapur I let the [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to freely practice their religion.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} He was also friendly towards the founder of [[Manichaeism]], [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], whom he allowed to preach freely and even to be an escort in his military expeditions.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} \n[[Image:Rare coin of Hormizd I.jpg|left|thumb|Coin of [[Hormizd I]].]]\nShapur I religious practices seems to have been somewhat unusual, with animal sacrifice being made for the soul of the kings and queens of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This presumably seemed \"pagan\" to Zoroastrian priests. {{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}} Kartir, who \"abhorred animal sacrifice\" was unable to stop Shapur I from doing them.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by [[Hormizd I]], who gave Kartir clothes that were worn by the upper class, the cap and belt (''kul\u0101f ud kamarband'') and appointed him as the chief priest (''[[mobad|mowbed]]'').{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}}\n\nHormizd I died the following year; Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir, whose authority and influence had greatly increased.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} Bahram I then made a settlement with his brother [[Narseh]] to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenia]], which was constantly the subject of war between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and Sasanian Empires.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Narseh held the title of ''Vazurg \u0160\u0101h Armin\u0101n'' (\"Great King of Armenia\"), which was used by the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\n===Under Bahram I===\n[[Image:Coin of the Sasanian king Bahram I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram I]].]]\nThe previous Sasanian shahs had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. However, with Bahram I's accession to the throne, and the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed; when Mani reached the city of [[Gundishapur]], much uproar occurred, in the same fashion as [[Jesus]]' entry into [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=74}} Kartir, along with other Zoroastrian priests protested and made Bahram I have Mani imprisoned and sentenced to death in 274.{{sfn|Daniel|2012|p=61}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\nMani's death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who used the persecution of religious minorities as a method to increase and spread their vast influence.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} Mani was seen by the Zoroastrian clergy as heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan who was presenting an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism, which had been tainted by non-Zoroastrian (i.e., Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian) ideas.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid foundations to a Zoroastrian state church.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} As a result, Bahram I became applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a \"benevolent and worthy king.\"{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} His son [[Bahram II]] succeeded him as shah; he may have been aided by Kartir to ascend the throne instead of Narseh.{{sfn|Daryaee|Rezakhani|2017|p=157}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This most likely frustrated Narseh, who had now been neglected from succession several times.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\n=== Under Bahram II, Bahram III and Narseh ===\n[[Image:Silver coin of Bahram II.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram II]].]]\n[[Image:NarsehCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Narseh]].]]\nBahram II, like his father, received Kartir well. He saw him as his mentor, and handed out several honors to Kartir, giving him the rank of grandee (''[[wuzurgan]]''), and appointing him as the supreme judge (''dadwar'') of the whole empire, which indicates that thenceforth priests were given the office of judge.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}} Kartir was also appointed the steward of the [[Anahid fire-temple]] at [[Istakhr]], which had originally been under the care of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} The Sasanian kings thus lost much of their religious authority in the empire. The clergy from now on served as judges all over the country, with court cases most likely being based on Zoroastrian jurisprudence, with the expection of when representatives of other religions had conflicts with each other.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\nIt is thus under Bahram II that Kartir unquestionably becomes a powerful figure in the empire; the latter claimed on his inscription that he \"struck down\" the non-Zoroastrian minorities, such as the [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} According to the modern historian Parvaneh Pourshariati: \"it is not clear, however, to what extent Kartir's declarations reflect the actual implementation, or for that matter, success, of the measures he is supposed to have promoted.\"{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}} Indeed, Jewish and Christian sources, for example, makes no mention of persecutions during this period.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}}{{sfn|Payne|2015|p=24}} Before Bahram II, all the previous Sasanian shahs had been \"lukewarm Zoroastrians.\"{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He died in 293 and was succeeded by his son [[Bahram III]].\n\nFour months into Bahram III's reign, Narseh was summoned to [[Mesopotamia]] at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility.

The saint's veneration dates to the 5th century with some certainty, and possibly still to the 4th. The addition of the [[Saint George and the Dragon|dragon legend]] dates to the 11th century.\n\nThe earliest text which preserves fragments of George's narrative is in a Greek hagiography which is identified by [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] of the scholarly [[Bollandist]]s to be a [[palimpsest]] of the 5th century.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/actasanctorum12unse#page/n148/mode/1up Acta Sanctorum], Volume 12, as republished in 1866</ref> \nAn earlier work by [[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church history]]'', written in the 4th century, contributed to the legend but did not name George or provide significant detail.<ref>[[Church History (Eusebius)]], book 8, chapter 5; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0640%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1 Greek text here], and [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0265-0339,_Eusebius_Caesariensis,_Historia_ecclesiastica_%5BSchaff%5D,_EN.pdf English text here].

[[Herbert Thurston]] in ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states that based upon an ancient cultus, narratives of the early pilgrims, and the early dedications of churches to Saint George, going back to the fourth century, \"there seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George\", although no faith can be placed in either the details of his history or his alleged exploits.<ref name=\"CE1913\">{{Cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston |wstitle=St. George}} \"There seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George, even though he is not commemorated in the Syrian, or in the primitive Hieronymian Martyrologium, but no faith can be placed in the attempts that have been made to fill up any of the details of his history. For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis. Still less is St. George to be considered, as suggested by Gibbon, Vetter, and others, a legendary double of the disreputable bishop, George of Cappadocia, the Arian opponent of St. Athanasius.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Attwater]], \"No historical particulars of his life have survived, ... The widespread veneration for St George as a soldier saint from early times had its centre in Palestine at Diospolis, now [[Lod|Lydda]].

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on the 23rd of April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis. Still less is St. George to be considered, as suggested by Gibbon, Vetter, and others, a legendary double of the disreputable bishop, George of Cappadocia, the Arian opponent of St. Athanasius.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Attwater]], \"No historical particulars of his life have survived, ...

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on the 23rd of April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=2011-10-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

The new unit was equipped with the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]] [[Uzi submachine gun]] as their primary weapon as it provided light and small automatic fire, essential properties for [[reconnaissance|recon]] units and [[commando]]s.<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=9395 The combat ethos is alive and well], [[Israel Hayom]], July 31, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe goals in creating the Paratroopers Brigade were: \n# To have an elite leading force.\n# To innovate and improve fighting skills within other units.\n# To raise the next generation of military commanders and officers.\n\nThe first commander of the Paratroopers Brigade was [[Ariel Sharon]].\n\nThe Paratroopers Brigade has had only one operational combat [[parachute]] drop, during the [[Suez Crisis|1956 Sinai War]]. In the [[Six-Day War]] (1967) reservists from this unit, formed into the [[55th Paratroopers Brigade]], took part in the capture of [[Jerusalem]], along with the [[Jerusalem Brigade]], [[Harel Brigade]] and armored support. The 55th Brigade paratroopers were the ones to capture the [[Western Wall]] and the [[Temple Mount]], considered a historic moment and the highlight of the war by the Israeli public due to the sanctity of these places to the [[Jew]]ish people.\n\nOver the years, the Paratroopers Brigade has been the source of several future [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Israeli Chiefs of Staff]], including [[Shaul Mofaz]], [[Moshe Ya'alon]], and [[Benny Gantz]].\n\n==Selection and training==\nService in the Paratroopers is voluntary and requires passing an intense two-day selection process<ref>{{cite web|title = Word of the Day / Gibush: Coming together like water molecules in the freezer - Word of the Day|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.613081|website = Haaretz.com|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}</ref> that includes tests of physical fitness as well as emotional preparedness, leadership skills and the ability to cooperate in a group. Each year the brigade receives five times more applicants than it can accept. Paratrooper recruits go through a year of training, and more than a quarter drop out. The paratrooper training course includes fitness training, [[Krav Maga]] training, harsh combat skills, specializing in a wide range of weapons, field craft, long marches with heavy equipment, weeks of survival training including navigation and camouflage, helicopter training, jump training, collaboration with other units, close quarters combat, and urban warfare. The course begins with four months of basic infantry training followed by advanced training that ends with a  \"Beret March\", where recruits march 80 kilometers in full combat gear, after which they are inducted into the IDF.<ref>https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2012/02/21/photos-final-challenge-paratrooper-training/</ref>\n\n==Battles & operations==\n\n===Reprisal operations===\n[[File:Dayan w Kuntila Raid comm.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Members of 890th Paratroop Battalion after Operation Egged (November 1955).

[[Aharon Davidi]], Lt. Ya'akov Ya'akov, Capt. [[Raful Eitan]]]]\nThe Paratroopers Brigade played a key role in the [[Reprisal operations]], a series of retaliatory raids into Arab territory in response to [[fedayeen]] attacks on Israel. In 1955, the 890th battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade carried out [[Operation Elkayam]], successfully attacking Egyptian military positions in the [[Khan Yunis]] area of the Gaza Strip. This was followed up with [[Operation Volcano]], a successful raid by paratroopers together with [[Nahal Brigade]] and [[Golani Brigade]] infantry against Egyptian military positions on the Egyptian-Israeli border that was the largest Israeli military undertaking since the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], and [[Operation Egged]] later that year, a raid that destroyed an Egyptian military post in the Sinai. In December 1955, paratroopers augmented by Nahal and [[Givati Brigade]] infantry carried out [[Operation Olive Leaves]], an attack on Syrian gun emplacements along the border which had been shelling Israel, destroying them. In 1956, a force of paratroopers carried out [[Operation Black Arrow]], raiding an Egyptian military base in Gaza and ambushing an Egyptian military relief convoy.\n\n===Sinai Campaign (1956)===\n[[File:Tzniha-mitle.jpg|thumb|An Israeli paratrooper in the Mitla Pass during the Suez Crisis]]\nThe [[Suez Crisis]] began with a drop of an entire paratroop battalion over the eastern approaches to the [[Mitla Pass]]. The remaining members of the brigade force were to travel along a 300&nbsp;km route (200&nbsp;km deep within enemy territory) and link up with the battalion. This break-through took 28 hours, during which the column swept through the deserted [[Kuntilla]] and fought two short but fierce battles against Egyptian forces in Thamad and Nakhl. The major paratroop action during the campaign was the battle for Mitla Pass. A paratroop reconnaissance patrol entering the pass found itself trapped by an overwhelming enemy force. The Egyptians enjoyed the topographical advantage, fighting from positions and niches in superior terrain. Outnumbered reinforcements who entered the fray fought desperately to rescue their comrades. After nightfall, the Egyptians were finally routed, but at the cost of 38 paratroopers dead and over 100 more wounded. Enemy losses were estimated at 260.\nThe paratroopers jumped once again during the Sinai Campaign\u2014at [[At-Tur]], on the south-eastern shore of the [[Gulf of Suez]]. The rest of the brigade proceeded by land to conquer [[Ras Sudar]] and link up with their comrades at At-Tur. They then moved southeastward to [[Sharm El Sheikh]] at the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]\u2014which they conquered in a classic pincers move in coordination with the 9th brigade which had been moving southwestward. After the war's end, the paratroopers concentrated on reorganization and training with emphasis on helicopter operations.\n\nAt least 49 Egyptian POWs were executed by the Paratroopers Brigade. The officer Arye Biro ordered the executions, because \"We had to move on to Ras Sudar\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fisk|first1=Robert|title=The great war for civilisation : the conquest of the Middle East|date=2007|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1400075173|page=916|edition=1.

Paratroopers and armor broke through the Rafah positions heavily defended by the Egyptian 7th Division from behind, with the unit suffering heavy losses. Many troops were further killed in action during the evacuation of the wounded. The following day, the unit entered [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Paratroop forces under the command of Danny Matt, who later attained the rank of Major General, made a helicopter landing at the Um Katef artillery positions in the enemy's rear line. A battalion raced against the 7th IDF Armored Division for the honor of being the first to reach the Suez Canal. Veteran paratrooper Aharon Davidi arrived first at the banks of the Suez. During the Six-Day War, paratroopers reached Sharm El Sheikh and likewise participated in the attack on the Golan. During the recapture of East Jerusalem from [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian annexation]], considerable care was taken to protect and avoid damaging the holy places of the three religions. For this, the Paratroopers paid a heavy price in dead and wounded.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSayeret Tzanhanim reconnaissance paratroopers equipped with Jeeps mounting 106mm recoilless rifles waged a campaign of destruction against Egyptian armor formations.<ref>Katz p.31</ref> During the [[Battle of Firdan Bridge]] the paratroopers destroyed dozens of [[T-55]] tanks right off the freighter in Alexandria harbor.<ref>Katz p.31</ref>\n\n===War of Attrition (1968\u20131973)===\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Paratroopers Brigade Reconnaissance Batallion in Live-Fire Drill (8).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paratroopers Reconnaissance in training]]\nAfter the Six-Day War, paratroopers participated in pursuit and retaliation operations against Egyptian infiltrators and became embroiled in the [[War of Attrition]] on various fronts.\nOn March 21, 1968, [[Battle of Karameh|paratroopers and armor raided]] a headquarters in [[Karameh|Karame]], [[Jordan]], killing 250 Jordanian soldiers. On December 12, 1968, a heliborne paratroop force raided [[Beirut Airport]] and destroyed Lebanese aircraft. The raid came in response to repeated terrorist attacks against Israeli aircraft. On December 23, 1969, paratroopers participated in [[Operation Rooster 53]], airlifting an entire Soviet radar station out of Egypt and transporting it back to Israel.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WebUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PP218#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Israel's Clandestine Diplomacies|last=Jones|first=Clive|last2=Petersen|first2=Tore T.|date=2013-11-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199365326|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1970, the brigade spearheaded [[Operation Rhodes]], taking over the Egyptian island of [[Shadwan]].

Gen. [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]] landed in different sites in and around [[Beirut]], where according to published foreign reports, they linked up with waiting cars hired by [[Mossad]] agents. According to these sources, the soldiers drove through Beirut without arousing suspicion. They simultaneously attacked the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's]] headquarters and the residences of three high-ranking PLO leaders responsible for the Fatah-Black September [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli athletes in 1972. Surprise was total, and despite fierce resistance in the headquarters, all teams succeeded in carrying out their missions and were extracted by [[Israeli Air Force]] helicopters. Two Israeli soldiers and dozens of PFLP fighters were killed during the fighting.\n\n===Yom Kippur War (1973)===\n[[File:Israeli Paratroopers - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|250px|Israeli paratroopers advance in the Sinai during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]\nThe [[Yom Kippur War]] saw the paratroopers fighting in some of the most difficult battles of the war. In the Sinai, paratroopers assigned to armored units rescued the beleaguered 'Budapest' outpost and destroyed the Egyptian forces. Paratroopers armed with LAW missiles helped contain an Egyptian armored thrust. Paratroopers of Danny Matt's brigade crossed the canal, as the spearhead of General Sharon's divisions, and established a bridgehead. Others, attempting to break open a route for them, ran up against the massive \"[[Battle of the Chinese Farm|Chinese Farm]]\" fortifications. For three days, paratroopers and armored corps of General Sharon's and General Adan's divisions made repeated attempts until they finally succeeded in breaking through and rescuing their comrades. During the bitter fighting, IDF soldiers ran over open ground to evacuate fallen comrades, and often fell victim to enemy fire in the process. The battles for the \"Chinese Farm\" prevented the Egyptians from closing in on the bridgehead and eventually succeeded in opening an access point to it. On the West Bank of the Suez Canal, paratroopers fought in the city of Suez and advanced upon the city of [[Ismailia]]. On the Syrian front, paratroopers captured the peaks of Mt. Hermon in a heliborne operation. Other troops conquered [[Quneitra]] in the Golan Heights and [[Tel Shams]] and acted as armored infantry in the thrust into Syrian territory.\nAfter the Yom Kippur War the paratroopers and other infantry units were placed under the command of a chief Paratroop and Infantry Officer.\n\nDuring an operation known as Operation Nightgown Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers were dropped off at a grassy opening near Kasr al-Hayr on the main Baghdad-Damascus Highway.<ref>Katz p.36</ref> They headed for a bridge where a brigade of Iraqi [[T-62]] tanks was about to cross en route to the Golan Heights battlefield.<ref>Katz p.36</ref> The paratroopers attacked the Iraqi armor from the front causing a bottleneck.

Gen. Dan Shomron succeeded in rescuing 102 passengers and crew of a hijacked Air France aircraft at [[Entebbe, Uganda]]. The Paratroopers force, led by Col. Matan Vilnai, was tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft. The commandos, transported in four [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport planes]], succeeded in landing undetected at Entebbe's airport and taking the hijackers and their Ugandan collaborators by surprise. All seven hijackers and dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed during the mission. After the raid, the assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages where they were shot at by Ugandan soldiers. Israeli forces returned fire with their [[AK-47]]s, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, [[Yonatan Netanyahu|Lt. Col. Yonatan \"Yoni\" Netanyahu]], the older brother of current Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], was shot in the chest and killed during the firefight. He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation. Three hostages were killed, one was left in Uganda, and approximately 10 were wounded. The 102 rescued hostages were flown to Israel via Nairobi, Kenya, shortly after the raid.\n\n===Operation Litani (1978)===\nParatroopers participated in the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|1978 invasion of Lebanon]], carried out after the infamous [[Coastal Road massacre]], which temporarily purged Southern Lebanon of [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] terrorists. After the IDF withdrawal and the return of sporadic attacks, the Paratroopers participated in preventive raids against bases in Lebanon, raids designed to keep the terrorists off balance and \"on the run,\" thereby preventing them from carrying out their operations within Israel.\n\n===First Lebanon War (1982)===\nThe paratroopers were an important component of the [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]].<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Win-the-close-fight-484803 Win the close fight], [[The Jerusalem Post]], March 21, 2017.</ref>  The war in Lebanon proved the IDF's fighting ability and tested Paratroop combat doctrine, which had been revised as a result of the lessons of the Yom Kippur War, Operation Litani and other operations.\nParatroopers fought in every sector of the war against Syrian troops and paratroops, both in built-up and mountainous areas. They operated efficiently and in full coordination with other corps, the Navy and the Air Force.\n\nOne of the better known operations was the amphibious landing at the mouth of the Awali River, north of [[Sidon]], from where the paratroopers advanced to the outskirts of Beirut through the mountains. In their advance, they engaged Syrian commando forces.<ref>{{cite web|title = Paratroopers Infantry Brigade {{!}} Jewish Virtual Library|url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/paratroop.html|website = www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}</ref>\n\n===Second Intifada===\nThe paratroopers played a key role in the [[Second Intifada]].

[[Aharon Davidi]], Lt. Ya'akov Ya'akov, Capt. [[Raful Eitan]]]]\nThe Paratroopers Brigade played a key role in the [[Reprisal operations]], a series of retaliatory raids into Arab territory in response to [[fedayeen]] attacks on Israel. In 1955, the 890th battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade carried out [[Operation Elkayam]], successfully attacking Egyptian military positions in the [[Khan Yunis]] area of the Gaza Strip. This was followed up with [[Operation Volcano]], a successful raid by paratroopers together with [[Nahal Brigade]] and [[Golani Brigade]] infantry against Egyptian military positions on the Egyptian-Israeli border that was the largest Israeli military undertaking since the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], and [[Operation Egged]] later that year, a raid that destroyed an Egyptian military post in the Sinai. In December 1955, paratroopers augmented by Nahal and [[Givati Brigade]] infantry carried out [[Operation Olive Leaves]], an attack on Syrian gun emplacements along the border which had been shelling Israel, destroying them. In 1956, a force of paratroopers carried out [[Operation Black Arrow]], raiding an Egyptian military base in Gaza and ambushing an Egyptian military relief convoy.\n\n===Sinai Campaign (1956)===\n[[File:Tzniha-mitle.jpg|thumb|An Israeli paratrooper in the Mitla Pass during the Suez Crisis]]\nThe [[Suez Crisis]] began with a drop of an entire paratroop battalion over the eastern approaches to the [[Mitla Pass]]. The remaining members of the brigade force were to travel along a 300&nbsp;km route (200&nbsp;km deep within enemy territory) and link up with the battalion. This break-through took 28 hours, during which the column swept through the deserted [[Kuntilla]] and fought two short but fierce battles against Egyptian forces in Thamad and Nakhl. The major paratroop action during the campaign was the battle for Mitla Pass. A paratroop reconnaissance patrol entering the pass found itself trapped by an overwhelming enemy force. The Egyptians enjoyed the topographical advantage, fighting from positions and niches in superior terrain. Outnumbered reinforcements who entered the fray fought desperately to rescue their comrades. After nightfall, the Egyptians were finally routed, but at the cost of 38 paratroopers dead and over 100 more wounded. Enemy losses were estimated at 260.\nThe paratroopers jumped once again during the Sinai Campaign\u2014at [[At-Tur]], on the south-eastern shore of the [[Gulf of Suez]]. The rest of the brigade proceeded by land to conquer [[Ras Sudar]] and link up with their comrades at At-Tur. They then moved southeastward to [[Sharm El Sheikh]] at the southern tip of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]\u2014which they conquered in a classic pincers move in coordination with the 9th brigade which had been moving southwestward. After the war's end, the paratroopers concentrated on reorganization and training with emphasis on helicopter operations.\n\nAt least 49 Egyptian POWs were executed by the Paratroopers Brigade. The officer Arye Biro ordered the executions, because \"We had to move on to Ras Sudar\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fisk|first1=Robert|title=The great war for civilisation : the conquest of the Middle East|date=2007|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1400075173|page=916|edition=1.

Paratroopers and armor broke through the Rafah positions heavily defended by the Egyptian 7th Division from behind, with the unit suffering heavy losses. Many troops were further killed in action during the evacuation of the wounded. The following day, the unit entered [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Paratroop forces under the command of Danny Matt, who later attained the rank of Major General, made a helicopter landing at the Um Katef artillery positions in the enemy's rear line. A battalion raced against the 7th IDF Armored Division for the honor of being the first to reach the Suez Canal. Veteran paratrooper Aharon Davidi arrived first at the banks of the Suez. During the Six-Day War, paratroopers reached Sharm El Sheikh and likewise participated in the attack on the Golan. During the recapture of East Jerusalem from [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian annexation]], considerable care was taken to protect and avoid damaging the holy places of the three religions.

Gen. [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]] landed in different sites in and around [[Beirut]], where according to published foreign reports, they linked up with waiting cars hired by [[Mossad]] agents. According to these sources, the soldiers drove through Beirut without arousing suspicion. They simultaneously attacked the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's]] headquarters and the residences of three high-ranking PLO leaders responsible for the Fatah-Black September [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli athletes in 1972. Surprise was total, and despite fierce resistance in the headquarters, all teams succeeded in carrying out their missions and were extracted by [[Israeli Air Force]] helicopters. Two Israeli soldiers and dozens of PFLP fighters were killed during the fighting.\n\n===Yom Kippur War (1973)===\n[[File:Israeli Paratroopers - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|250px|Israeli paratroopers advance in the Sinai during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]\nThe [[Yom Kippur War]] saw the paratroopers fighting in some of the most difficult battles of the war. In the Sinai, paratroopers assigned to armored units rescued the beleaguered 'Budapest' outpost and destroyed the Egyptian forces. Paratroopers armed with LAW missiles helped contain an Egyptian armored thrust. Paratroopers of Danny Matt's brigade crossed the canal, as the spearhead of General Sharon's divisions, and established a bridgehead. Others, attempting to break open a route for them, ran up against the massive \"[[Battle of the Chinese Farm|Chinese Farm]]\" fortifications. For three days, paratroopers and armored corps of General Sharon's and General Adan's divisions made repeated attempts until they finally succeeded in breaking through and rescuing their comrades. During the bitter fighting, IDF soldiers ran over open ground to evacuate fallen comrades, and often fell victim to enemy fire in the process. The battles for the \"Chinese Farm\" prevented the Egyptians from closing in on the bridgehead and eventually succeeded in opening an access point to it. On the West Bank of the Suez Canal, paratroopers fought in the city of Suez and advanced upon the city of [[Ismailia]]. On the Syrian front, paratroopers captured the peaks of Mt. Hermon in a heliborne operation. Other troops conquered [[Quneitra]] in the Golan Heights and [[Tel Shams]] and acted as armored infantry in the thrust into Syrian territory.\nAfter the Yom Kippur War the paratroopers and other infantry units were placed under the command of a chief Paratroop and Infantry Officer.\n\nDuring an operation known as Operation Nightgown Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers were dropped off at a grassy opening near Kasr al-Hayr on the main Baghdad-Damascus Highway.<ref>Katz p.36</ref> They headed for a bridge where a brigade of Iraqi [[T-62]] tanks was about to cross en route to the Golan Heights battlefield.<ref>Katz p.36</ref> The paratroopers attacked the Iraqi armor from the front causing a bottleneck.

Gen. Dan Shomron succeeded in rescuing 102 passengers and crew of a hijacked Air France aircraft at [[Entebbe, Uganda]]. The Paratroopers force, led by Col. Matan Vilnai, was tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft. The commandos, transported in four [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport planes]], succeeded in landing undetected at Entebbe's airport and taking the hijackers and their Ugandan collaborators by surprise. All seven hijackers and dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed during the mission. After the raid, the assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages where they were shot at by Ugandan soldiers. Israeli forces returned fire with their [[AK-47]]s, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, [[Yonatan Netanyahu|Lt. Col. Yonatan \"Yoni\" Netanyahu]], the older brother of current Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], was shot in the chest and killed during the firefight. He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation. Three hostages were killed, one was left in Uganda, and approximately 10 were wounded. The 102 rescued hostages were flown to Israel via Nairobi, Kenya, shortly after the raid.\n\n===Operation Litani (1978)===\nParatroopers participated in the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|1978 invasion of Lebanon]], carried out after the infamous [[Coastal Road massacre]], which temporarily purged Southern Lebanon of [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] terrorists. After the IDF withdrawal and the return of sporadic attacks, the Paratroopers participated in preventive raids against bases in Lebanon, raids designed to keep the terrorists off balance and \"on the run,\" thereby preventing them from carrying out their operations within Israel.\n\n===First Lebanon War (1982)===\nThe paratroopers were an important component of the [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]].<ref>Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Win-the-close-fight-484803 Win the close fight], [[The Jerusalem Post]], March 21, 2017.</ref>  The war in Lebanon proved the IDF's fighting ability and tested Paratroop combat doctrine, which had been revised as a result of the lessons of the Yom Kippur War, Operation Litani and other operations.\nParatroopers fought in every sector of the war against Syrian troops and paratroops, both in built-up and mountainous areas. They operated efficiently and in full coordination with other corps, the Navy and the Air Force.\n\nOne of the better known operations was the amphibious landing at the mouth of the Awali River, north of [[Sidon]], from where the paratroopers advanced to the outskirts of Beirut through the mountains.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The period ended with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] from the German [[House of Hanover]].\n\nThe period was plagued by internal and religious strife, and a large-scale civil war which resulted in the [[Execution of Charles I|execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1649. The [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], largely under the control of [[Oliver Cromwell]], is included here for continuity, even though the Stuarts were in exile. The Cromwell regime collapsed and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had very wide support for his taking of the throne in 1660. His brother [[James II of England|James II]] was overthrown in 1689 in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He was replaced by his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and her Dutch husband [[William III of England|William III]]. Mary's sister Anne was the last of the line. For the next half century James II and his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart]] claimed that they were the true Stuart kings, but they were in exile and attempts  to return with French aid but they were defeated\n\n==Political history==\n\n===James VI and I: 1603\u20131626===\n{{Main|Jacobean era|James VI and I}}\n\n====Rule of the upper-classes====\nEngland was ruled at the national level by royalty and nobility, and at the local level by the lesser nobility and the gentry. Together they comprised about 2% of the families, owned most of the good farmland, and controlled local government affairs.<ref>For in-depth coverage, start with Lawrence Stone, ''The crisis of the aristocracy: 1558\u20131641'' (abridged edition, 1967) pp 23\u201361.</ref> The aristocracy was growing steadily in numbers, wealth, and power. From 1540 to 1640, the number of peers (dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, and barons) grew from 60 families to 160. They inherited their titles through [[primogeniture]], had a favoured position in legal matters, enjoyed the highest positions in society, and held seats in the House of Lords. In 1611, the king looking for new revenue sources created the hereditary rank of [[baronet]], with a status below that of the nobility, and no seat in Lords, and a price tag of about \u00a31100. The vast land holdings seized from the monasteries under [[Henry VIII of England]] in the 1530s were sold mostly to local gentry, greatly expanding the wealth of that class of gentlemen. The gentry tripled to 15,000 from 5000 in the century after 1540. Many families died out, and others moved up, so that three-fourths of the peers in 1714 had been created by Stuart kings since 1603.<ref>Clayton Roberts, David Roberts, and Douglas R.

He also became king of Ireland, but the English were just reestablishing lost control there. The English re-conquest was completed after victory in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]], 1594\u20131603. James' appointees in Dublin as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. The great majority of the Irish population remained Catholic, but James promoted heavy Protestant migration from Scotland into the [[Ulster]] region. The new arrivals were known as [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] or Scotch-Irish. In turn many of them migrated to the new American colonies during the Stuart period.<ref>Tyler Blethen and Curtis Wood, eds., ''Ulster and North America: transatlantic perspectives on the Scotch-Irish'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===Charles I: 1625\u20131649===\n{{Main|Caroline era|Charles I of England}}\nKing James was failing in physical and mental strength, because of this he was often mocked by his family and his own father would throw objects at him when he would try to stand up, and decision-making was increasingly in the hands of Charles and especially [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]] (1592\u20131628), (he was Earl of Buckingham from 1617 and Duke from 1623). Buckingham showed a very high degree of energy and application, as well as a huge appetite for rewards and riches. By 1624 he was effectively the ruler of England. In 1625 Charles became the king of a land deeply involved in a European war and rent by escalating religious controversies. Buckingham and Charles developed a foreign policy based on an alliance with France against Spain. Major foreign adventures against [[C\u00e1diz]] in 1625 and in support of French [[Huguenots]] in 1627 were total disasters. Widespread rumour shaped public opinion that blamed Buckingham, rather than the king, for the ills that beset England. When Parliament twice opened impeachment proceedings, the king simply prorogued (suspended) the Parliament. Buckingham was assassinated in 1628 by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]], a dissatisfied Army officer. The assassin was executed, but he nevertheless became a heroic martyr across the three kingdoms.<ref>David Coast, \"Rumor and 'Common Fame': The Impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham and Public Opinion in Early Stuart England.\" ''Journal of British Studies'' 55.2 (2016): 241\u2013267.

By 1628 he and Buckingham had transformed the political landscape. In 1629 the king dissolved parliament and began a period of eleven years of personal rule.<ref>Kevin Sharpe, ''The personal rule of Charles I'' (1992).</ref><ref>Lovell J. Reeve, ''Charles I and the road to personal rule'' (2003).</ref>\n\n====Personal rule: 1629\u20131640====\n{{Further|Charles I of England#Personal rule}}\nEnglish government was quite small, for the king had no standing army, and no bureaucracy stationed around the country. Laws were enforced primarily by local officials controlled by the local elites. Military operations were typically handled by hired mercenaries. The greatest challenge King Charles faced in ruling without a parliament was raising money. The crown was in debt nearly \u00a31.2 million; financiers in the City refused new loans.<ref>Davies, ''Early Stuarts'' pp 82\u201385</ref> Charles saved money by signing peace treaties with France in 1629 and Spain in 1630, and avoiding involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. He cut the usual budget but it was not nearly enough. Then he discovered a series of ingenious methods to raise money without permission of Parliament.<ref>Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 136\u2013 45.</ref> They had been rarely used, but were nevertheless legal. He sold monopolies, despite their unpopularity. He fined the landowners for supposedly encroaching on the royal forests. Compulsory [[knighthood]] had been established in the Middle Ages when men of certain wealth were ordered to become knights in the king's service, or else pay a fine. When knighthood lost its military status, the payments continued, but they had been abandoned by 1560. James reinstated the fine, and hired new officials to search local records to find wealthy men who did not have knighthood status. They were forced to pay, including [[Oliver Cromwell]] among thousands of other country gentlemen across rural England. \u00a3173,000 was raised, in addition to raising bitter anger among the gentry.<ref>H. H. Leonard, \"Distraint of Knighthood: The Last Phase, 1625\u201341.\" ''History'' 63.207 (1978): 23\u201337. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24410394 online]</ref> The king finally crossed the line of legality when he began to levy \"[[ship money]]\", intended for naval defences, upon interior towns. Protests now escalated to include urban elites. All the new measures generated long-term outrage, but they did balance the short-term budget, which averaged \u00a3600,000, without the need to call Parliament into session.<ref>M. D. Gordon, \"The Collection of Ship-money in the Reign of Charles I.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' 4 (1910): 141\u2013162. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3678388 online]</ref>\n\n====Long Parliament of 1640====\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\nRevolts broke out in Scotland in response to the king's imposition of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which threatened to undermine the religion of the people. The Scots drove English forces out and forced the king to subsidise the insurgents who were now occupying part of northern England. A major revolt among Catholics in Ireland killed thousands of Scots Irish\u2014there was no doubt it had to be suppressed and new taxes would be needed to pay the costs of military action. A new Parliament had to be called.<ref>Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 152\u201355.</ref> The Long Parliament elected in 1640 proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach and remove the king's leading counsellors for high treason. [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] was taken into custody on 10 November; [[William Laud]], the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|Archbishop of Canterbury]] was impeached on 18 December; [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch]], now [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]], was impeached the following day, and he fled to [[Holland]]. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the [[Triennial Act]], which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted [[royal assent]] in February 1641.<ref>Pauline Gregg, ''King Charles I'' (1981), pp 324\u201326.</ref><ref>Conrad Russell, \"Why Did Charles I Call the Long Parliament?.\" ''History'' 69.227 (1984): 375\u2013383.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1875621 online]</ref>\n\n===Civil War and Interregnum: 1642\u20131660===\n{{Main|English Civil War|Commonwealth of England|Interregnum (1649\u20131660)}}\nThe [[First English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131645 ended in victory for the Parliamentarians over the Royalists (often called \"[[Cavaliers]]\"). The Parliamentarians were often called \"[[Roundhead]]s\" because of their short practical haircuts. The [[Second English Civil War]] was fought in 1648\u20131649; Charles lost and the [[execution of Charles I]] took place in January 1649.\n\nThe monarchy was temporarily displaced by the Commonwealth of England from 1649 to 1660. [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled directly from 1653 to his death in 1658, whereupon his Commonwealth disintegrated. The [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], son of Charles I, to return from exile and become king.\n\nThe war period (1642\u20131651) saw a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists, with most of the fighting in England. The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651. Historians debate whether the main determinant of the outcome was based on superior operational decisions and decisive battlefield events (as argued by Malcolm Wanklyn), or rather Parliament's long-run superiority in manpower and money (as argued by Clive Holmes).<ref>Peter Gaunt, ''The English Civil War: A Military History'' (2014) pp 223\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe overall outcome was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658). When Cromwell died his son [[Richard Cromwell]] was incapable of governing, and the Puritan army directly ruled the three kingdoms, to the growing disgust of all classes of people. The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on religion was strengthened by the suppression of the last remnants of Catholicism, and the powerful forces of [[Puritans|Puritanism]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]]. Constitutionally, the wars convinced everyone that an English monarch cannot govern alone, nor could Parliament. They were both essential.<ref>Useful textbooks include Clayton Roberts, F. David Roberts, and Douglas Bisson, ''A History of England, Volume 1: Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2016) ch 14; Michael Lynch, ''The interregnum: 1649\u201360'' (1994); and Angela Anderson, ''The civil wars 1640-9'' (1995).</ref>\n\n====Cromwell====\n{{Further|Oliver Cromwell|Commonwealth of England|The Protectorate}}\nIn 1649\u201359 the dominant figure in England\u2014although he refused the offer of kingship\u2014was [[Oliver Cromwell]], the highly successful Parliamentarian general.<ref>J.S. Morrill, ''Oliver Cromwell and the English revolution'' (1990).</ref>  He worked hard at the time to ensure good publicity for his reign, and his successful wars. He remains a favourite topic of historians even as he is one of the most controversial figures in British history and his intense religiosity has long been out of fashion.<ref>Nicole Greenspan, ''Selling Cromwell's Wars: Media, Empire and Godly Warfare, 1650\u20131658'' (2016).</ref>\n\n=====The Commonwealth: 1649\u20131653=====\nAfter the execution of the King, a republic was declared, known as the [[Commonwealth of England]]. A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs, which included Cromwell among its members. His real power base was in the army; Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original group of 'Royal Independents' centred around St John and Saye and Sele, but only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. From the middle of 1649 until 1651, Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to fight each other. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell eventually dismissed the Rump Parliament in 1653.<ref>Blair Worden, ''The Rump Parliament 1648\u201353'' (1977).</ref> He summoned a new Parliament, whose members were all nominated.  Sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, it was also called the [[Barebones Parliament]]. The Parliament was based on an idea of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]]'s for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs \u2013 which saw a sanhedrin as the precondition of Christ's rule on earth \u2013 he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of a cross-section of sects.<ref>C.H. Midgley, \"Political thinking and the creation of the Assembly of 1653.\" ''The Seventeenth Century'' 31.1 (2016): 37\u201356.</ref> However, its failure to deal with the complex political, legal and religious problems facing England soon led to its closeure.<ref>Austin Woolrych, ''Commonwealth to protectorate'' (1982).</ref>\n\n=====The Protectorate: 1653\u20131658=====\n\nIn December 1653 Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector, with powers akin to those of a monarch. Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars, and which he subsequently prudently guarded, and during his period of dictatorship he divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major Generals who answered only to him.  The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central to Cromwell's moral crusade beginning in October 1655. They lasted less than a year. The generals not only supervised militia forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and insured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. They were resented by provincials. Many members of Parliament feared the generals threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which Parliament voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise.<ref>Christopher Durston, \"The Fall of Cromwell's Major-Generals,\" ''English Historical Review'' (1998) 113#450: 18\u201337. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/576177 online].</ref>\n\nThe [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] broke out in 1652, against the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]], eventually won by the Royal Navy under [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Admiral Robert Blake]] in 1654.\n\nCromwell was aware of the contribution that Jewish financiers made to the economic success of Holland, now England's leading commercial rival.  It was this that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]], 350 years after their banishment, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Nathan Osterman, \"The Controversy over the Proposed Readmission of the Jews to England (1655).\" ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1941): 301\u2013328 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4464425 online].</ref>\n\nIn 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by a re-constituted Parliament; since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he said no after long deliberation. He ruled as king in all but name, but his office was not hereditary. Instead Cromwell was to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the 1653 [[Instrument of Government]].\n\n====Historiography====\nThe older [[historiography]] came in two flavours: The [[Whig history]] interpretation and the [[Marxist historiography]] interpretation. The Whig model, dominant in the 19th century, saw an inherent conflict between irresistible, truly English ideals of [[liberty]] and [[individualism]] represented by The Puritans and Roundheads, overcoming the medieval concept of the [[Divine right of kings|king as the unquestionable voice of God]]. Historians became increasingly uncomfortable with the writing of history as a [[Determinism|predetermined]] search for an [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic goal]], and the Whig approach lost favour after the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914\u20131918). Meanwhile, in the late 19th century, the remarkably high quality scholarship of archivally oriented historians, especially [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] and [[Charles Harding Firth]] had provided the rich details on national politics, practically on a day-by-day basis. Scholars, however, generally neglected the local dimension.<ref>R.C.

It portrayed a battle between the declining [[The Crown|Crown]] and [[upper class]] [[Feudalism|feudalistic]] [[aristocracy]], versus the rising [[middle class]] [[gentry]]. Marxists downplayed the religious dimension. On one side, influential names included [[R. H. Tawney]], [[Lawrence Stone]], and the Marxist [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. The main argument was that the Civil War was a challenge launched by the rising gentry class to overcome the power of the Crown and the aristocracy. Marxists like Hill saw the war as England's [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolution\u2014that is, the overthrow of an outdated feudal order by the new middle class. The class conflict interpretation was vigorously challenged by conservative scholars, such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that the gentry was not rising but instead felt that its status was being undermined. It fought back against its exclusion from the power, [[patronage]] and payoff by an extravagant court, by the king's swelling state [[bureaucracy]] and by the [[nouveau riche]] [[Investor#Role of the financier|financiers]] in London.<ref>Blair Worden, \"History's Heroic Age\" ''History Today'' (2012) 62#4.</ref><ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 98\u2013132.</ref><ref>Hugh Trevor-Roper, [http://www.historytoday.com/hugh-trevor-roper/country-house-radicals-1590-1660 \"Country-House Radicals 1590\u20131660\" ''History Today'' (1953) 3#7 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903025336/http://www.historytoday.com/hugh-trevor-roper/country-house-radicals-1590-1660 |date=2017-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nMarxist historiography itself lost much of its intellectual support after the 1960s. \"[[Historical revisionism|Revisionists]]\" came to the fore, rejecting both Whig and Marxist approaches because they assumed historical events were the automatic playing out of mysterious forces such as \"liberty\"and \"class conflict.\"<ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 169\u201372.</ref> New microscopic local studies demonstrated that the class differences between the two sides varied greatly from place to place, and did not explain very much.<ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 133\u201349.</ref> Once The revisionists had dispatched the older models, the \"post-revisionists\" began to offer a multiplicity of small-scale explanations that fitted particular localities. Historians now give much more emphasis to [[religiosity]], and to the diversity of local situations. Instead of an argument that massive popular anger had built up in the early 17th century and caused the Civil War, the current approaches depict the early Stuart period as marked by harmony, good government, and popular support. How then could there be a civil war? The current scholarly solution is to emphasise what historians call the \"British problem\", involving the impossible tensions occurring when a single person tried to hold together his three kingdoms with their entirely different geographical, ethnic, political, and religious values and traditions.<ref>Barry Coward and Peter Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age: England, 1603\u20131714'' (5th ed. 2017) [https://www.amazon.com/Stuart-Age-England-1603-1714/dp/1138944173/ pp 4\u20135 available at Amazon].</ref><ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 150\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and Charles II: 1660\u20131685===\n{{Main|English Restoration|Charles II of England}}\nWidespread dissatisfaction with the lack of the king led to the Restoration in 1660, which was based on strong support for inviting Charles II to take the throne.<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reigns of James II and William III'' (1955) pp 195\u2013221.</ref> The restoration settlement of 1660 reestablished the monarchy, and incorporated the lessons learned in the previous half century. The first basic lesson was that the king and the parliament were both needed, for troubles cumulated when the king attempted to rule alone (1629\u20131640), when Parliament ruled without a king (1642\u20131653) or when there was a military dictator (1653\u20131660). The [[Tory]] perspective involved a greater respect for the king, and for the Church of England. The [[Whiggism|Whig]] perspective involved a greater respect for Parliament. The two perspectives eventually coalesced into opposing political factions throughout the 18th century. The second lesson was that the highly moralistic Puritans were too inclined to divisiveness and political extremes. The Puritans and indeed all Protestants who did not closely adhere to the Church of England, were put under political and social penalties that lasted until the early 19th century. Even more severe restrictions were imposed on Catholics and Unitarians. The third lesson was that England needed protection against organised political violence. Politicized mobs in London, or popular revolts in the rural areas, were too unpredictable and too dangerous to be tolerated.<ref>Bucholz and Key, ''Early Modern England'', pp 265\u201366.</ref><ref>Ronald Hutton, ''Charles the Second, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (Oxford UP, 1989) pp 133 \u2013 214</ref> The king's solution was a [[standing army]], a professional force controlled by the king. This solution became highly controversial.<ref>J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian moment: Florentine political thought and the Atlantic republican tradition'' (1975) pp 406\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of 1660 was a deliberate return to the stability of the early 17th century. There was very little recrimination. King Charles acted with moderation and self-restraint, and with energy and attention to details.<ref>Hutton, pp. 136, 141.</ref> The king reached out to everyone, finding high positions for his old friends and allies as well as places for his former enemies. By far the most important role went to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], who was made Earl of Clarendon and [[List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers|Lord Chancellor]] in 1660. He was largely in control of royal affairs, especially after his daughter [[Anne Hyde]] married the king's brother James (he became king in 1685). When the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] ended in failure in 1667, the king removed Clarendon in a severe confrontation; the earl was accused of treason and was banished to France.<ref>Hutton, pp 249\u201354.</ref> Charles was willing to talk to every faction in England, Ireland and Scotland, even with the [[Quakers]], who were hated by practically everyone else. Charles gave out high offices in England with an eye toward favouring his longtime allies, and making sure his erstwhile enemies received at least some symbolic positions. In Scotland he included all of the important factions from the 1640s. In Ireland he retained the men currently in power.<ref>Hutton, pp 134\u201335.</ref>\n\nThe King and Parliament agreed on a general pardon, the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] (1660). It covered everyone, with the exception of three dozen [[regicide]]s who were tracked down for punishment. The terms of the settlement included giving the King a fixed annual payment of \u00a31.2 million; Scotland and Ireland added small additional amounts. It was illegal to use dubious non-parliamentary fund-raising such as payments for knighthood, forced loans, and especially the much-hated ship money. Parliament did impose an entirely new excise tax on alcoholic beverages that raise substantial sums, as did the customs, for foreign trade was flourishing. Parliament closed down the harsh special courts that Charles had used before 1642, such as the [[Star Chamber]], [[Court of High Commission]], and the [[Council of the North]]. Parliament watched Charles' ministers closely for any signs of defiance, and was ready to use the impeachment procedure to remove offenders and even to pass bills of attainder to execute them without a trial.<ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his Kingdom 1660\u20131685'' (2003), pp 43\u201351.</ref>\n\nReligious issues proved the most difficult to resolve. Charles reinstated the bishops, but also tried to reach out to the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. Catholics were entirely shut out of opportunities to practice their religion or connect to the [[Papal States]] in Rome. The Royalists won a sweeping [[1661 English general election|election victory in 1661]]; only 60 Presbyterians survived in Parliament. Severe restrictions were now imposed on the Nonconformist Protestant bodies in England, preventing them from holding scheduled church services, and prohibiting their members from holding government offices at the national or local level. For example, The five-mile law in 1665 made it a crime for nonconformist clergymen to be within 5 miles of their old parish.<ref>Harris, p 53</ref> The Puritans still controlled the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the [[Connecticut Colony]], but they kept a low profile during the interregnum. Charles II cancelled their charters and imposed centralised rule through the [[Dominion of New England]]. His colonial policies were reversed by William III. Most of the smaller independent religious factions faded away, except for the Quakers. The Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Baptists remain, and were later joined by the Methodists. These non-Anglican Protestants continued as a political factor, with its leaders moving toward what became the Whig party. The country gentry continued to form the basis of support for the Church of England, and for what became the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]].<ref>J.P. Kenyon, ''Stuart England'' (1985) pp 195\u2013213.</ref>\n\nParliament was especially alarmed at the success of Cromwell's [[New Model Army]], which demonstrated that a well-organized, well-led professional army was far superior to poorly trained [[militia]] units. Cromwell had used his standing army to take full personal control, and so it was much to be feared as a threat to traditional liberties. The New Model Army was permanently disbanded, and all the soldiers received their full back pay. On the other hand, as long as enemy nations such as Spain and France, had large standing armies, England was practically defenceless on land. King and Parliament all agreed on the wisdom of a strong expanded [[Royal Navy]]. But while the king tried to build up a small standing army, Parliament kept a very close, nervous watch.<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''Britain and her army, 1509\u20131970: a military, political and social survey'' (1970) pp 90\u201398, 110\u201325.</ref>\n\nPuritanism was entirely out of fashion, as the royal court introduced a level of [[hedonism]] that far exceeded anything England had ever seen. Harris says, \"At the center of this world was a [[libertine]] court \u2013 a society of Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]] given more to drinking, gambling, swearing and whoring than to godliness \u2013 presided over by the King himself and his equally rakish brother James, Duke of York.\" <ref>Harris, p 46</ref>\n\n====Standing army====\n{{Further|History of the British Army#Origins}}\nEngland never had a [[standing army]] with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants. It relied on militia organised by local officials, private forces mobilised by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.<ref>David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24\u201345.</ref> Cromwell changed all that with his New Model Army of 50,000 men, that proved vastly more effective than untrained militia, and enabled him to exert a powerful control at the local level over all of England. At the restoration, Parliament paid off Cromwell's army and disbanded it. For many decades the Cromwellian model was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H. Firth ed. 1913) 1:136-38</ref> The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so. However, King Charles managed to pull together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of \u00a3122.000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent [[British Army]], By 1685 it had grown to 7500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1400 men permanently stationed in garrisons. A rebellion in 1685 allowed James II to raise the forces to 20,000 men. There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000 soldiers, and then to 94,000 in 1694. Parliament became very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7,000 in 1697. Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.<ref>Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 46\u201357.</ref>\n\n===Glorious Revolution of 1688\u20131689===\n{{main|Glorious Revolution}}\nThe British have always regarded the overthrow of King [[James II of England]] in 1688 as a decisive break in history, especially as it made the Parliament of England supreme over the King and guaranteed a bill of legal rights to everyone. [[Steven Pincus]] argues that this revolution was the first modern revolution; it was violent, popular, and divisive. He rejects older theories to the effect that it was an aristocratic coup or a Dutch invasion. Instead, Pincus argues it was a widely supported and decisive rejection of James II. The people could not tolerate James any longer. He was too close to the French throne; he was too Roman Catholic; and they distrusted his [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] modernisation of the state. What they got instead was the vision of William of Orange, shared by most leading Englishmen, that emphasised consent of all the elites, religious toleration of all Protestant sects, free debate in Parliament and aggressive promotion of commerce. Pincus sees a dramatic transformation that reshaped religion, political economy, foreign policy and even the nature of the English state.<ref>Steven Pincus, ''1688: The First Modern Revolution'' (2011)</ref><ref>Steven C.

However the primary reason William accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of King [[Louis XIV of France]]. William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-date Belgium) out of French hands. The English elite was intensely [[anti-French]], and generally supported William's broad goals.<ref>George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (2nd ed. 1956)  pp 148\u201353.</ref><ref>Clayton Roberts et al., ''A History of England: volume I Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 245\u201348.</ref> For his entire career in Netherlands and Britain, William was the arch-enemy of Louis XIV.

England and France would be at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697\u20131701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].<ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 160\u201374.</ref> The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralise that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658\u20131705), who was based in Vienna, Austria. Leopold, however, was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.<ref>For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688\u20131725'' (1970) pp 154\u2013192, 223\u201367, 284\u201390, 381\u2013415, 741\u201354.</ref> William was usually supported by the English leadership, which saw France as its greatest enemy. But eventually the  expenses, and war weariness, but the second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the  [[Bank of England]] in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688\u20131783'' (1989) p 133.</ref><ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 174\u201379.</ref>  In the long-running [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u201397) his main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands.  Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognise William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France.Williams focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.<ref>David Onnekink, \"'Mynheer Benting now rules over us': the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689\u201399.\" ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693\u2013713.

The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive.  William died just as the continuation war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1702\u20131714), was beginning. It was fought out by Queen Anne, and ended in a draw.<ref>For summaries of foreign policy see J.R.

Baxter]] is a leading specialist on  William III, and like nearly all his biographers he has a highly favourable opinion of the king:\n:William III was the Deliverer of England from the tyranny and arbitrary government of the Stuarts....He repaired and improved an obsolete system of government, and left it strong enough to withstand the stresses of the next century virtually unchanged.  The army of Marlborough, and that of Wellington, and to a large extent that of Raglan, was the creation of William III. So too was the independence of the judiciary..... [His government] was very expensive; at their peak the annual expenditures of William III were four times as large as those of James II. This new scale of government was bitterly unpopular.  But the new taxes, which were not in fact heavy by comparison with those borne by the Dutch, made England a great power.  And they contributed to the prosperity of the country while they contributed to its strength, by the process which is now called 'pump-priming.'<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen B.

Down until 1710, the Parliament was dominated by the \"[[Whig Junto]]\" coalition. She disliked them and relied instead on her old friends [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] (and his wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]]), and chief minister [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710).<ref>Coward and Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age'' pp 439\u201345.</ref> She made Marlborough captain-general and head of the army; his brilliant victories boded well for Britain at first. But the war dragged on into an expensive stalemate. The opposition Tories had opposed the war all along, and now won a major electoral victory in 1710. Anne reacted by dismissing Marlborough and Godolphin and turning to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]]. She had 12 miscarriages and 6 babies, but only one survived and he died at age 11, so her death ended the Stuart period. Anne's intimate friendship with Sarah Churchill turned sour in 1707 as the result of political differences.

Queen Anne, ruling both countries, worked to bring them together in the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. Public opinion in Scotland was generally hostile, but elite opinion was supportive, especially after the English provided generous financial terms and timely bribes. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] agreed to the terms and disbanded. The new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] was in practice simply the old [[Parliament of England]] augmented by 45 Scots elected to Commons; it selected 16 Scottish peers for the House of Lords. Scotland was much smaller in terms of population and wealth. Its colonial venture in the [[Darien scheme]] had been a major financial and humanitarian disaster. The Acts of Union refunded the losses of the Scottish investors in Darien. In basic terms, Scotland retained its own Presbyterian established church, and its own legal and educational systems, as well it's its own separate nobility. The Scots now paid English taxes, although in reduced rates, and had a voice in the affairs of Great Britain.<ref>T.M.

England was spared the frenzy on [[Continental Europe]]; with over 5% of Europe's population in 1600, England executed only 1% of the 40,000 witches killed in the period 1400\u20131800.<ref>William Monter, \"Re-contextualizing British witchcraft.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 35.1 (2004): 105\u2013111.

King James VI and I made the suppression of witchcraft a high priority in both Scotland, and (in 1604) in England. Judges across England sharply increased their investigation of accused 'witches', thus generating a body of highly detailed local documentation that has provided the main basis for recent historical research on the topic.  Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from [[anthropology]].<ref>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).</ref><ref>Jonathan Barry, \"Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft\" in Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996) pp. 1\u201346</ref><ref>Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).</ref> They argued that English witchcraft was endemic year in and year out, rather than happening in epidemic outbursts. Older women were the favourite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.<ref>Clarke Garrett, \"\"Women and witches: Patterns of analysis.\" ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461\u2013470.

As the process of psychological modernisation reached more and more people, fears of witchcraft and magic tended to steadily diminish. After 1660 Puritans were largely excluded from the judiciary and lost their power to investigate. In 1712, [[Jane Wenham (alleged witch)|Jane Wenham]] was the last woman found guilty of witchcraft in England. In 1735 Parliament no longer believed that witchcraft was real\u2014despite the efforts of [[James Erskine, Lord Grange]], the Scottish Lord who made a fool of himself speaking in opposition. Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] which made it a crime to accuse someone of witchcraft. The laws against witchcraft were not fully repealed until 1951 with the passing of the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]].<ref>Peter Elmer, ''Witchcraft, Witch-Hunting, and Politics in Early Modern England'' (2016) ch 5.</ref> Witchcraft was a minor issue of little importance in Ireland.<ref>Andrew Sneddon, \"Witchcraft belief and trials in early modern Ireland.\" ''Irish Economic and Social History'' 39.1 (2012): 1\u201325.</ref> However, Scotland was a major centre of suppression; 3900 Scots were tried; two thirds were convicted and executed, the last of whom was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727.<ref>Brian P.

The dramatists did not criticise the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper&nbsp;...

People could relocate from one village to another inside these networks without feeling like they were strangers. The network would include for example one or more market towns, county centres, or small cities. Roads existed and were supplemented by turnpikes. However the chief means of transportation was typically by water, since it was much cheaper to move wagon loads of commodities, especially wool and cloth, by boat than over land.  Much effort was made to improve the river system, by removing obstacles. A mania to build canals, 1790\u20131840, enlarged the range and lowered costs. After 1840, the coming of railroads enlarged the range of local networks so much that the localism was overwhelmed<ref>H.J. Dyos and D.H.

By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nAs an island there was little incentive for gaining new territory. In the Tudor and Stuart periods the main foreign policy goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was the building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  Wool was the great commercial product. Home production of wool supplied internal needs, while raw wool and wool cloth made up 75\u201390% of exports.<ref>Peter J.

The golden era of the Wiltshire woolen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woolens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500\u20131750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E.

A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England. Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back. However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A.

[[James VI and I|King James I]] (reigned 1603\u201325) was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, but for Europe as a whole.<ref>Roger Lockyer, ''James VI and I'' (1998) pp 138\u201358.</ref> He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself \"Rex Pacificus\" (\"King of peace.\")<ref>Malcolm Smuts, \"The making of ''Rex Pacificus'': James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., ''Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I'' (2002) pp 371\u201387</ref> At the time, Europe was deeply polarised, and on the verge of the massive [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] in the \"[[Spanish Match]]\". The marriage of James' daughter Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the [[Protestant Union]], headquartered in [[Heidelberg]], the capital of the [[Electoral Palatinate]]. King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his na\u00efvet\u00e9, he did not realise that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving the destruction of the other side. Spain's ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar]] knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the [[Vienna]]-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], were both heavily influenced by the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.<ref>W. B. Patterson, \"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618\u201322.\" ''Studies in Church History'' 18 (1982): 319\u2013334.</ref>\n\nLord Buckingham in the 1620s wanted an alliance with Spain.<ref>Godfrey Davies, ''The Early Stuarts: 1603\u20131660'' (1959), pp 47\u201367</ref> Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623. However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or there would be no marriage. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to provide them with military support for their cause. James' son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, an event which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years' War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], and massacred their followers. The Catholic [[Duchy of Bavaria]] then invaded the [[Electoral Palatinate]], and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention. James finally realised that his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades. James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favoured the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.<ref>Jonathan Scott, ''England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context'' (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nFrederick's election as King of Bohemia in 1619 deepened the [[Thirty Years' War]]\u2014a conflagration that destroyed millions of lives in central Europe, but only barely touched Britain. The intense hatred and rivalry of Catholic versus Protestant princes was the main cause. King James' determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the \"war fever\" of 1623, was one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, '' Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 17\u201342.</ref>\n\nDuring 1600\u20131650 the kings made repeated efforts to colonise [[The Guianas|Guiana]] in [[South America]].

The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. Religion was not a factor, since both sides were Protestant.<ref>Steven C. A. Pincus, ''Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650\u20131668'' (1996)</ref> The British in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] (1652\u201354) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful \"[[Ship of the line|ships of the line]]\" which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The British also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. In the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665\u201367) Dutch naval victories followed. This second war cost London ten times more than it had planned on, and the king sued for peace in 1667 with the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]]. It ended the fights over \"[[mercantilism]]\" (that is, the use of force to protect and expand national trade, industry, and shipping.) Meanwhile, the French were building up fleets that threatened both the Netherlands and Great Britain. In the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672\u201374), the British counted on a new alliance with France but the outnumbered Dutch outsailed both of them, and King Charles II ran short of money and political support. The Dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until 1713. The British gained the thriving colony of [[New Netherland]], which was renamed as the [[Province of New York]].<ref>James Rees Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch wars of the seventeenth century'' (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0582056306 online]</ref><ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"The role of mercantilism in Anglo\u2010Dutch political relations, 1650\u201374.\" ''Economic History Review'' 63#3 (2010): 591\u2013611.</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\nThe Stuart period began in 1603 with the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and the accession of King James I.

The period ended with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] from the German [[House of Hanover]].\n\nThe period was plagued by internal and religious strife, and a large-scale civil war which resulted in the [[Execution of Charles I|execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1649. The [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], largely under the control of [[Oliver Cromwell]], is included here for continuity, even though the Stuarts were in exile. The Cromwell regime collapsed and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had very wide support for his taking of the throne in 1660. His brother [[James II of England|James II]] was overthrown in 1689 in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He was replaced by his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and her Dutch husband [[William III of England|William III]]. Mary's sister Anne was the last of the line. For the next half century James II and his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart]] claimed that they were the true Stuart kings, but they were in exile and attempts  to return with French aid but they were defeated\n\n==Political history==\n\n===James VI and I: 1603\u20131626===\n{{Main|Jacobean era|James VI and I}}\n\n====Rule of the upper-classes====\nEngland was ruled at the national level by royalty and nobility, and at the local level by the lesser nobility and the gentry. Together they comprised about 2% of the families, owned most of the good farmland, and controlled local government affairs.<ref>For in-depth coverage, start with Lawrence Stone, ''The crisis of the aristocracy: 1558\u20131641'' (abridged edition, 1967) pp 23\u201361.</ref> The aristocracy was growing steadily in numbers, wealth, and power. From 1540 to 1640, the number of peers (dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, and barons) grew from 60 families to 160. They inherited their titles through [[primogeniture]], had a favoured position in legal matters, enjoyed the highest positions in society, and held seats in the House of Lords. In 1611, the king looking for new revenue sources created the hereditary rank of [[baronet]], with a status below that of the nobility, and no seat in Lords, and a price tag of about \u00a31100. The vast land holdings seized from the monasteries under [[Henry VIII of England]] in the 1530s were sold mostly to local gentry, greatly expanding the wealth of that class of gentlemen. The gentry tripled to 15,000 from 5000 in the century after 1540. Many families died out, and others moved up, so that three-fourths of the peers in 1714 had been created by Stuart kings since 1603.<ref>Clayton Roberts, David Roberts, and Douglas R.

He also became king of Ireland, but the English were just reestablishing lost control there. The English re-conquest was completed after victory in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]], 1594\u20131603. James' appointees in Dublin as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. The great majority of the Irish population remained Catholic, but James promoted heavy Protestant migration from Scotland into the [[Ulster]] region. The new arrivals were known as [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] or Scotch-Irish. In turn many of them migrated to the new American colonies during the Stuart period.<ref>Tyler Blethen and Curtis Wood, eds., ''Ulster and North America: transatlantic perspectives on the Scotch-Irish'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===Charles I: 1625\u20131649===\n{{Main|Caroline era|Charles I of England}}\nKing James was failing in physical and mental strength, because of this he was often mocked by his family and his own father would throw objects at him when he would try to stand up, and decision-making was increasingly in the hands of Charles and especially [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]] (1592\u20131628), (he was Earl of Buckingham from 1617 and Duke from 1623). Buckingham showed a very high degree of energy and application, as well as a huge appetite for rewards and riches. By 1624 he was effectively the ruler of England. In 1625 Charles became the king of a land deeply involved in a European war and rent by escalating religious controversies. Buckingham and Charles developed a foreign policy based on an alliance with France against Spain. Major foreign adventures against [[C\u00e1diz]] in 1625 and in support of French [[Huguenots]] in 1627 were total disasters. Widespread rumour shaped public opinion that blamed Buckingham, rather than the king, for the ills that beset England. When Parliament twice opened impeachment proceedings, the king simply prorogued (suspended) the Parliament. Buckingham was assassinated in 1628 by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]], a dissatisfied Army officer.

By 1628 he and Buckingham had transformed the political landscape. In 1629 the king dissolved parliament and began a period of eleven years of personal rule.<ref>Kevin Sharpe, ''The personal rule of Charles I'' (1992).</ref><ref>Lovell J. Reeve, ''Charles I and the road to personal rule'' (2003).</ref>\n\n====Personal rule: 1629\u20131640====\n{{Further|Charles I of England#Personal rule}}\nEnglish government was quite small, for the king had no standing army, and no bureaucracy stationed around the country. Laws were enforced primarily by local officials controlled by the local elites. Military operations were typically handled by hired mercenaries. The greatest challenge King Charles faced in ruling without a parliament was raising money. The crown was in debt nearly \u00a31.2 million; financiers in the City refused new loans.<ref>Davies, ''Early Stuarts'' pp 82\u201385</ref> Charles saved money by signing peace treaties with France in 1629 and Spain in 1630, and avoiding involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. He cut the usual budget but it was not nearly enough. Then he discovered a series of ingenious methods to raise money without permission of Parliament.<ref>Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 136\u2013 45.</ref> They had been rarely used, but were nevertheless legal. He sold monopolies, despite their unpopularity. He fined the landowners for supposedly encroaching on the royal forests. Compulsory [[knighthood]] had been established in the Middle Ages when men of certain wealth were ordered to become knights in the king's service, or else pay a fine. When knighthood lost its military status, the payments continued, but they had been abandoned by 1560. James reinstated the fine, and hired new officials to search local records to find wealthy men who did not have knighthood status. They were forced to pay, including [[Oliver Cromwell]] among thousands of other country gentlemen across rural England. \u00a3173,000 was raised, in addition to raising bitter anger among the gentry.<ref>H.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24410394 online]</ref> The king finally crossed the line of legality when he began to levy \"[[ship money]]\", intended for naval defences, upon interior towns. Protests now escalated to include urban elites. All the new measures generated long-term outrage, but they did balance the short-term budget, which averaged \u00a3600,000, without the need to call Parliament into session.<ref>M. D.

The Scots drove English forces out and forced the king to subsidise the insurgents who were now occupying part of northern England. A major revolt among Catholics in Ireland killed thousands of Scots Irish\u2014there was no doubt it had to be suppressed and new taxes would be needed to pay the costs of military action. A new Parliament had to be called.<ref>Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 152\u201355.</ref> The Long Parliament elected in 1640 proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach and remove the king's leading counsellors for high treason. [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] was taken into custody on 10 November; [[William Laud]], the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|Archbishop of Canterbury]] was impeached on 18 December; [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch]], now [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]], was impeached the following day, and he fled to [[Holland]]. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the [[Triennial Act]], which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted [[royal assent]] in February 1641.<ref>Pauline Gregg, ''King Charles I'' (1981), pp 324\u201326.</ref><ref>Conrad Russell, \"Why Did Charles I Call the Long Parliament?.\" ''History'' 69.227 (1984): 375\u2013383.

The Parliamentarians were often called \"[[Roundhead]]s\" because of their short practical haircuts. The [[Second English Civil War]] was fought in 1648\u20131649; Charles lost and the [[execution of Charles I]] took place in January 1649.\n\nThe monarchy was temporarily displaced by the Commonwealth of England from 1649 to 1660. [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled directly from 1653 to his death in 1658, whereupon his Commonwealth disintegrated. The [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], son of Charles I, to return from exile and become king.\n\nThe war period (1642\u20131651) saw a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists, with most of the fighting in England. The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651. Historians debate whether the main determinant of the outcome was based on superior operational decisions and decisive battlefield events (as argued by Malcolm Wanklyn), or rather Parliament's long-run superiority in manpower and money (as argued by Clive Holmes).<ref>Peter Gaunt, ''The English Civil War: A Military History'' (2014) pp 223\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe overall outcome was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658). When Cromwell died his son [[Richard Cromwell]] was incapable of governing, and the Puritan army directly ruled the three kingdoms, to the growing disgust of all classes of people. The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on religion was strengthened by the suppression of the last remnants of Catholicism, and the powerful forces of [[Puritans|Puritanism]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]]. Constitutionally, the wars convinced everyone that an English monarch cannot govern alone, nor could Parliament. They were both essential.<ref>Useful textbooks include Clayton Roberts, F.

A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs, which included Cromwell among its members. His real power base was in the army; Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original group of 'Royal Independents' centred around St John and Saye and Sele, but only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. From the middle of 1649 until 1651, Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to fight each other. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell eventually dismissed the Rump Parliament in 1653.<ref>Blair Worden, ''The Rump Parliament 1648\u201353'' (1977).</ref> He summoned a new Parliament, whose members were all nominated.  Sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, it was also called the [[Barebones Parliament]]. The Parliament was based on an idea of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]]'s for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs \u2013 which saw a sanhedrin as the precondition of Christ's rule on earth \u2013 he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of a cross-section of sects.<ref>C.H. Midgley, \"Political thinking and the creation of the Assembly of 1653.\" ''The Seventeenth Century'' 31.1 (2016): 37\u201356.</ref> However, its failure to deal with the complex political, legal and religious problems facing England soon led to its closeure.<ref>Austin Woolrych, ''Commonwealth to protectorate'' (1982).</ref>\n\n=====The Protectorate: 1653\u20131658=====\n\nIn December 1653 Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector, with powers akin to those of a monarch. Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars, and which he subsequently prudently guarded, and during his period of dictatorship he divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major Generals who answered only to him.  The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central to Cromwell's moral crusade beginning in October 1655. They lasted less than a year. The generals not only supervised militia forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and insured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. They were resented by provincials. Many members of Parliament feared the generals threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which Parliament voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise.<ref>Christopher Durston, \"The Fall of Cromwell's Major-Generals,\" ''English Historical Review'' (1998) 113#450: 18\u201337. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/576177 online].</ref>\n\nThe [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] broke out in 1652, against the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]], eventually won by the Royal Navy under [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Admiral Robert Blake]] in 1654.\n\nCromwell was aware of the contribution that Jewish financiers made to the economic success of Holland, now England's leading commercial rival.  It was this that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]], 350 years after their banishment, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Nathan Osterman, \"The Controversy over the Proposed Readmission of the Jews to England (1655).\" ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1941): 301\u2013328 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4464425 online].</ref>\n\nIn 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by a re-constituted Parliament; since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he said no after long deliberation. He ruled as king in all but name, but his office was not hereditary. Instead Cromwell was to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the 1653 [[Instrument of Government]].\n\n====Historiography====\nThe older [[historiography]] came in two flavours: The [[Whig history]] interpretation and the [[Marxist historiography]] interpretation. The Whig model, dominant in the 19th century, saw an inherent conflict between irresistible, truly English ideals of [[liberty]] and [[individualism]] represented by The Puritans and Roundheads, overcoming the medieval concept of the [[Divine right of kings|king as the unquestionable voice of God]]. Historians became increasingly uncomfortable with the writing of history as a [[Determinism|predetermined]] search for an [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic goal]], and the Whig approach lost favour after the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914\u20131918). Meanwhile, in the late 19th century, the remarkably high quality scholarship of archivally oriented historians, especially [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] and [[Charles Harding Firth]] had provided the rich details on national politics, practically on a day-by-day basis. Scholars, however, generally neglected the local dimension.<ref>R.C. Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (Manchester UP, 1998) pp 65\u201397.</ref>\n\nIn the [[post-war]] era (1945\u2013), the [[class conflict]] of the Marxist interpretation emerged as a powerful explanation that seemed to tie all the details together. It portrayed a battle between the declining [[The Crown|Crown]] and [[upper class]] [[Feudalism|feudalistic]] [[aristocracy]], versus the rising [[middle class]] [[gentry]]. Marxists downplayed the religious dimension. On one side, influential names included [[R. H. Tawney]], [[Lawrence Stone]], and the Marxist [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. The main argument was that the Civil War was a challenge launched by the rising gentry class to overcome the power of the Crown and the aristocracy. Marxists like Hill saw the war as England's [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolution\u2014that is, the overthrow of an outdated feudal order by the new middle class. The class conflict interpretation was vigorously challenged by conservative scholars, such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that the gentry was not rising but instead felt that its status was being undermined. It fought back against its exclusion from the power, [[patronage]] and payoff by an extravagant court, by the king's swelling state [[bureaucracy]] and by the [[nouveau riche]] [[Investor#Role of the financier|financiers]] in London.<ref>Blair Worden, \"History's Heroic Age\" ''History Today'' (2012) 62#4.</ref><ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 98\u2013132.</ref><ref>Hugh Trevor-Roper, [http://www.historytoday.com/hugh-trevor-roper/country-house-radicals-1590-1660 \"Country-House Radicals 1590\u20131660\" ''History Today'' (1953) 3#7 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903025336/http://www.historytoday.com/hugh-trevor-roper/country-house-radicals-1590-1660 |date=2017-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nMarxist historiography itself lost much of its intellectual support after the 1960s. \"[[Historical revisionism|Revisionists]]\" came to the fore, rejecting both Whig and Marxist approaches because they assumed historical events were the automatic playing out of mysterious forces such as \"liberty\"and \"class conflict.\"<ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 169\u201372.</ref> New microscopic local studies demonstrated that the class differences between the two sides varied greatly from place to place, and did not explain very much.<ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 133\u201349.</ref> Once The revisionists had dispatched the older models, the \"post-revisionists\" began to offer a multiplicity of small-scale explanations that fitted particular localities. Historians now give much more emphasis to [[religiosity]], and to the diversity of local situations. Instead of an argument that massive popular anger had built up in the early 17th century and caused the Civil War, the current approaches depict the early Stuart period as marked by harmony, good government, and popular support. How then could there be a civil war? The current scholarly solution is to emphasise what historians call the \"British problem\", involving the impossible tensions occurring when a single person tried to hold together his three kingdoms with their entirely different geographical, ethnic, political, and religious values and traditions.<ref>Barry Coward and Peter Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age: England, 1603\u20131714'' (5th ed. 2017) [https://www.amazon.com/Stuart-Age-England-1603-1714/dp/1138944173/ pp 4\u20135 available at Amazon].</ref><ref>Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 150\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Restoration and Charles II: 1660\u20131685===\n{{Main|English Restoration|Charles II of England}}\nWidespread dissatisfaction with the lack of the king led to the Restoration in 1660, which was based on strong support for inviting Charles II to take the throne.<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reigns of James II and William III'' (1955) pp 195\u2013221.</ref> The restoration settlement of 1660 reestablished the monarchy, and incorporated the lessons learned in the previous half century. The first basic lesson was that the king and the parliament were both needed, for troubles cumulated when the king attempted to rule alone (1629\u20131640), when Parliament ruled without a king (1642\u20131653) or when there was a military dictator (1653\u20131660). The [[Tory]] perspective involved a greater respect for the king, and for the Church of England. The [[Whiggism|Whig]] perspective involved a greater respect for Parliament. The two perspectives eventually coalesced into opposing political factions throughout the 18th century. The second lesson was that the highly moralistic Puritans were too inclined to divisiveness and political extremes. The Puritans and indeed all Protestants who did not closely adhere to the Church of England, were put under political and social penalties that lasted until the early 19th century. Even more severe restrictions were imposed on Catholics and Unitarians. The third lesson was that England needed protection against organised political violence. Politicized mobs in London, or popular revolts in the rural areas, were too unpredictable and too dangerous to be tolerated.<ref>Bucholz and Key, ''Early Modern England'', pp 265\u201366.</ref><ref>Ronald Hutton, ''Charles the Second, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (Oxford UP, 1989) pp 133 \u2013 214</ref> The king's solution was a [[standing army]], a professional force controlled by the king. This solution became highly controversial.<ref>J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian moment: Florentine political thought and the Atlantic republican tradition'' (1975) pp 406\u201313.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of 1660 was a deliberate return to the stability of the early 17th century. There was very little recrimination. King Charles acted with moderation and self-restraint, and with energy and attention to details.<ref>Hutton, pp. 136, 141.</ref> The king reached out to everyone, finding high positions for his old friends and allies as well as places for his former enemies. By far the most important role went to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], who was made Earl of Clarendon and [[List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers|Lord Chancellor]] in 1660. He was largely in control of royal affairs, especially after his daughter [[Anne Hyde]] married the king's brother James (he became king in 1685). When the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] ended in failure in 1667, the king removed Clarendon in a severe confrontation; the earl was accused of treason and was banished to France.<ref>Hutton, pp 249\u201354.</ref> Charles was willing to talk to every faction in England, Ireland and Scotland, even with the [[Quakers]], who were hated by practically everyone else. Charles gave out high offices in England with an eye toward favouring his longtime allies, and making sure his erstwhile enemies received at least some symbolic positions. In Scotland he included all of the important factions from the 1640s. In Ireland he retained the men currently in power.<ref>Hutton, pp 134\u201335.</ref>\n\nThe King and Parliament agreed on a general pardon, the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] (1660). It covered everyone, with the exception of three dozen [[regicide]]s who were tracked down for punishment. The terms of the settlement included giving the King a fixed annual payment of \u00a31.2 million; Scotland and Ireland added small additional amounts. It was illegal to use dubious non-parliamentary fund-raising such as payments for knighthood, forced loans, and especially the much-hated ship money. Parliament did impose an entirely new excise tax on alcoholic beverages that raise substantial sums, as did the customs, for foreign trade was flourishing. Parliament closed down the harsh special courts that Charles had used before 1642, such as the [[Star Chamber]], [[Court of High Commission]], and the [[Council of the North]]. Parliament watched Charles' ministers closely for any signs of defiance, and was ready to use the impeachment procedure to remove offenders and even to pass bills of attainder to execute them without a trial.<ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his Kingdom 1660\u20131685'' (2003), pp 43\u201351.</ref>\n\nReligious issues proved the most difficult to resolve. Charles reinstated the bishops, but also tried to reach out to the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. Catholics were entirely shut out of opportunities to practice their religion or connect to the [[Papal States]] in Rome. The Royalists won a sweeping [[1661 English general election|election victory in 1661]]; only 60 Presbyterians survived in Parliament. Severe restrictions were now imposed on the Nonconformist Protestant bodies in England, preventing them from holding scheduled church services, and prohibiting their members from holding government offices at the national or local level. For example, The five-mile law in 1665 made it a crime for nonconformist clergymen to be within 5 miles of their old parish.<ref>Harris, p 53</ref> The Puritans still controlled the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the [[Connecticut Colony]], but they kept a low profile during the interregnum. Charles II cancelled their charters and imposed centralised rule through the [[Dominion of New England]]. His colonial policies were reversed by William III. Most of the smaller independent religious factions faded away, except for the Quakers. The Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Baptists remain, and were later joined by the Methodists. These non-Anglican Protestants continued as a political factor, with its leaders moving toward what became the Whig party. The country gentry continued to form the basis of support for the Church of England, and for what became the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]].<ref>J.P. Kenyon, ''Stuart England'' (1985) pp 195\u2013213.</ref>\n\nParliament was especially alarmed at the success of Cromwell's [[New Model Army]], which demonstrated that a well-organized, well-led professional army was far superior to poorly trained [[militia]] units. Cromwell had used his standing army to take full personal control, and so it was much to be feared as a threat to traditional liberties. The New Model Army was permanently disbanded, and all the soldiers received their full back pay. On the other hand, as long as enemy nations such as Spain and France, had large standing armies, England was practically defenceless on land. King and Parliament all agreed on the wisdom of a strong expanded [[Royal Navy]]. But while the king tried to build up a small standing army, Parliament kept a very close, nervous watch.<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''Britain and her army, 1509\u20131970: a military, political and social survey'' (1970) pp 90\u201398, 110\u201325.</ref>\n\nPuritanism was entirely out of fashion, as the royal court introduced a level of [[hedonism]] that far exceeded anything England had ever seen. Harris says, \"At the center of this world was a [[libertine]] court \u2013 a society of Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]] given more to drinking, gambling, swearing and whoring than to godliness \u2013 presided over by the King himself and his equally rakish brother James, Duke of York.\" <ref>Harris, p 46</ref>\n\n====Standing army====\n{{Further|History of the British Army#Origins}}\nEngland never had a [[standing army]] with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants. It relied on militia organised by local officials, private forces mobilised by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.<ref>David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24\u201345.</ref> Cromwell changed all that with his New Model Army of 50,000 men, that proved vastly more effective than untrained militia, and enabled him to exert a powerful control at the local level over all of England. At the restoration, Parliament paid off Cromwell's army and disbanded it. For many decades the Cromwellian model was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H. Firth ed. 1913) 1:136-38</ref> The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so. However, King Charles managed to pull together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of \u00a3122.000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent [[British Army]], By 1685 it had grown to 7500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1400 men permanently stationed in garrisons. A rebellion in 1685 allowed James II to raise the forces to 20,000 men. There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000 soldiers, and then to 94,000 in 1694. Parliament became very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7,000 in 1697. Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.<ref>Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 46\u201357.</ref>\n\n===Glorious Revolution of 1688\u20131689===\n{{main|Glorious Revolution}}\nThe British have always regarded the overthrow of King [[James II of England]] in 1688 as a decisive break in history, especially as it made the Parliament of England supreme over the King and guaranteed a bill of legal rights to everyone. [[Steven Pincus]] argues that this revolution was the first modern revolution; it was violent, popular, and divisive. He rejects older theories to the effect that it was an aristocratic coup or a Dutch invasion. Instead, Pincus argues it was a widely supported and decisive rejection of James II. The people could not tolerate James any longer. He was too close to the French throne; he was too Roman Catholic; and they distrusted his [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] modernisation of the state. What they got instead was the vision of William of Orange, shared by most leading Englishmen, that emphasised consent of all the elites, religious toleration of all Protestant sects, free debate in Parliament and aggressive promotion of commerce. Pincus sees a dramatic transformation that reshaped religion, political economy, foreign policy and even the nature of the English state.<ref>Steven Pincus, ''1688: The First Modern Revolution'' (2011)</ref><ref>Steven C.

However the primary reason William accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of King [[Louis XIV of France]]. William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-date Belgium) out of French hands. The English elite was intensely [[anti-French]], and generally supported William's broad goals.<ref>George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (2nd ed. 1956)  pp 148\u201353.</ref><ref>Clayton Roberts et al., ''A History of England: volume I Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 245\u201348.</ref> For his entire career in Netherlands and Britain, William was the arch-enemy of Louis XIV.

England and France would be at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697\u20131701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].<ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 160\u201374.</ref> The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralise that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658\u20131705), who was based in Vienna, Austria. Leopold, however, was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.<ref>For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed.

But eventually the  expenses, and war weariness, but the second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies.

Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognise William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France.Williams focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.<ref>David Onnekink, \"'Mynheer Benting now rules over us': the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689\u201399.\" ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693\u2013713.

The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive.  William died just as the continuation war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1702\u20131714), was beginning.

Baxter]] is a leading specialist on  William III, and like nearly all his biographers he has a highly favourable opinion of the king:\n:William III was the Deliverer of England from the tyranny and arbitrary government of the Stuarts....He repaired and improved an obsolete system of government, and left it strong enough to withstand the stresses of the next century virtually unchanged.  The army of Marlborough, and that of Wellington, and to a large extent that of Raglan, was the creation of William III. So too was the independence of the judiciary..... [His government] was very expensive; at their peak the annual expenditures of William III were four times as large as those of James II. This new scale of government was bitterly unpopular.  But the new taxes, which were not in fact heavy by comparison with those borne by the Dutch, made England a great power.  And they contributed to the prosperity of the country while they contributed to its strength, by the process which is now called 'pump-priming.'<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen B.

Down until 1710, the Parliament was dominated by the \"[[Whig Junto]]\" coalition. She disliked them and relied instead on her old friends [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] (and his wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]]), and chief minister [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710).<ref>Coward and Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age'' pp 439\u201345.</ref> She made Marlborough captain-general and head of the army; his brilliant victories boded well for Britain at first. But the war dragged on into an expensive stalemate. The opposition Tories had opposed the war all along, and now won a major electoral victory in 1710. Anne reacted by dismissing Marlborough and Godolphin and turning to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]]. She had 12 miscarriages and 6 babies, but only one survived and he died at age 11, so her death ended the Stuart period. Anne's intimate friendship with Sarah Churchill turned sour in 1707 as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs as ignorant and easily led, which was a theme widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.<ref>Edward Gregg, ''Queen Anne'' (Yale UP, 2001) pp viii\u2013ix</ref><ref>Edward Gregg, \"Anne (1665\u20131714),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford UP, 2004; online edn, Jan 2012) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/560, accessed 29 Aug 2017] doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/560</ref>\n\nAnne took a lively interest in affairs of state, and was a noted patroness of theatre, poetry and music.

Queen Anne, ruling both countries, worked to bring them together in the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. Public opinion in Scotland was generally hostile, but elite opinion was supportive, especially after the English provided generous financial terms and timely bribes. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] agreed to the terms and disbanded. The new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] was in practice simply the old [[Parliament of England]] augmented by 45 Scots elected to Commons; it selected 16 Scottish peers for the House of Lords. Scotland was much smaller in terms of population and wealth. Its colonial venture in the [[Darien scheme]] had been a major financial and humanitarian disaster. The Acts of Union refunded the losses of the Scottish investors in Darien. In basic terms, Scotland retained its own Presbyterian established church, and its own legal and educational systems, as well it's its own separate nobility. The Scots now paid English taxes, although in reduced rates, and had a voice in the affairs of Great Britain.<ref>T.M.

The risk of war between the two was greatly diminished, although [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] raids launched from the north hit England for another forty years.

Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining \"freedom of trade with England and the colonies\" as well as \"a great expansion of markets.\" Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was:\n:of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations&nbsp;...

The [[Witch-hunt|persecution of witches]] began in England in 1563, and hundreds were executed. England was spared the frenzy on [[Continental Europe]]; with over 5% of Europe's population in 1600, England executed only 1% of the 40,000 witches killed in the period 1400\u20131800.<ref>William Monter, \"Re-contextualizing British witchcraft.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 35.1 (2004): 105\u2013111.

King James VI and I made the suppression of witchcraft a high priority in both Scotland, and (in 1604) in England. Judges across England sharply increased their investigation of accused 'witches', thus generating a body of highly detailed local documentation that has provided the main basis for recent historical research on the topic.  Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from [[anthropology]].<ref>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).</ref><ref>Jonathan Barry, \"Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft\" in Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996) pp. 1\u201346</ref><ref>Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).</ref> They argued that English witchcraft was endemic year in and year out, rather than happening in epidemic outbursts. Older women were the favourite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.<ref>Clarke Garrett, \"\"Women and witches: Patterns of analysis.\" ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461\u2013470.

As the process of psychological modernisation reached more and more people, fears of witchcraft and magic tended to steadily diminish. After 1660 Puritans were largely excluded from the judiciary and lost their power to investigate. In 1712, [[Jane Wenham (alleged witch)|Jane Wenham]] was the last woman found guilty of witchcraft in England. In 1735 Parliament no longer believed that witchcraft was real\u2014despite the efforts of [[James Erskine, Lord Grange]], the Scottish Lord who made a fool of himself speaking in opposition. Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] which made it a crime to accuse someone of witchcraft. The laws against witchcraft were not fully repealed until 1951 with the passing of the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]].<ref>Peter Elmer, ''Witchcraft, Witch-Hunting, and Politics in Early Modern England'' (2016) ch 5.</ref> Witchcraft was a minor issue of little importance in Ireland.<ref>Andrew Sneddon, \"Witchcraft belief and trials in early modern Ireland.\" ''Irish Economic and Social History'' 39.1 (2012): 1\u201325.</ref> However, Scotland was a major centre of suppression; 3900 Scots were tried; two thirds were convicted and executed, the last of whom was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727.<ref>Brian P.

The dramatists did not criticise the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct.

However, Charles Phythian-Adams has used local evidence to paint a much more complex picture.<ref>Charles Phythian-Adams, ''Societies, Cultures and Kinship, 1580\u20131850: Cultural Provinces and English Local History'' (Leicester, 1996), pp. 9\u201323.</ref> Data from the location of brides and grooms, the sources of financial credit, and patterns of migration indicate that each village was embedded in a network of villages and transportation routes. People could relocate from one village to another inside these networks without feeling like they were strangers. The network would include for example one or more market towns, county centres, or small cities. Roads existed and were supplemented by turnpikes. However the chief means of transportation was typically by water, since it was much cheaper to move wagon loads of commodities, especially wool and cloth, by boat than over land.  Much effort was made to improve the river system, by removing obstacles. A mania to build canals, 1790\u20131840, enlarged the range and lowered costs. After 1840, the coming of railroads enlarged the range of local networks so much that the localism was overwhelmed<ref>H.J. Dyos and D.H. Aldcroft, ''British transport: an economic survey from the seventeenth century to the twentieth'' (1969)  pp 19\u201344, 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n===World trade===\nThe 18th century was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nAs an island there was little incentive for gaining new territory. In the Tudor and Stuart periods the main foreign policy goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was the building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  Wool was the great commercial product. Home production of wool supplied internal needs, while raw wool and wool cloth made up 75\u201390% of exports.<ref>Peter J.

The British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports were stable at \u00a32.5 million from 1613 to 1669, then soared \u00a36.5 million in 1700, to \u00a314.7 million in 1760 and \u00a343.2 million in 1800.<ref>E.

The golden era of the Wiltshire woolen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woolens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500\u20131750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E.

A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England. Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back. However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500\u20131700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119\u201320.</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy==\nStuart England was primarily consumed with internal affairs. [[James VI and I|King James I]] (reigned 1603\u201325) was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, but for Europe as a whole.<ref>Roger Lockyer, ''James VI and I'' (1998) pp 138\u201358.</ref> He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself \"Rex Pacificus\" (\"King of peace.\")<ref>Malcolm Smuts, \"The making of ''Rex Pacificus'': James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., ''Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I'' (2002) pp 371\u201387</ref> At the time, Europe was deeply polarised, and on the verge of the massive [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] in the \"[[Spanish Match]]\". The marriage of James' daughter Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the [[Protestant Union]], headquartered in [[Heidelberg]], the capital of the [[Electoral Palatinate]]. King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his na\u00efvet\u00e9, he did not realise that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving the destruction of the other side. Spain's ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar]] knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the [[Vienna]]-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], were both heavily influenced by the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.<ref>W. B. Patterson, \"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618\u201322.\" ''Studies in Church History'' 18 (1982): 319\u2013334.</ref>\n\nLord Buckingham in the 1620s wanted an alliance with Spain.<ref>Godfrey Davies, ''The Early Stuarts: 1603\u20131660'' (1959), pp 47\u201367</ref> Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623. However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or there would be no marriage. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to provide them with military support for their cause. James' son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, an event which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years' War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], and massacred their followers. The Catholic [[Duchy of Bavaria]] then invaded the [[Electoral Palatinate]], and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention. James finally realised that his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades. James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favoured the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.<ref>Jonathan Scott, ''England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context'' (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nFrederick's election as King of Bohemia in 1619 deepened the [[Thirty Years' War]]\u2014a conflagration that destroyed millions of lives in central Europe, but only barely touched Britain. The intense hatred and rivalry of Catholic versus Protestant princes was the main cause. King James' determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the \"war fever\" of 1623, was one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, '' Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 17\u201342.</ref>\n\nDuring 1600\u20131650 the kings made repeated efforts to colonise [[The Guianas|Guiana]] in [[South America]].

Loomie, ''Spain & the Early Stuarts, 1585\u20131655'' (1996).</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Dutch Wars===\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were a series of three wars which took place between the English and the Dutch from 1652 to 1674. The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. Religion was not a factor, since both sides were Protestant.<ref>Steven C. A. Pincus, ''Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650\u20131668'' (1996)</ref> The British in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] (1652\u201354) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful \"[[Ship of the line|ships of the line]]\" which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The British also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. In the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665\u201367) Dutch naval victories followed. This second war cost London ten times more than it had planned on, and the king sued for peace in 1667 with the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]]. It ended the fights over \"[[mercantilism]]\" (that is, the use of force to protect and expand national trade, industry, and shipping.) Meanwhile, the French were building up fleets that threatened both the Netherlands and Great Britain. In the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672\u201374), the British counted on a new alliance with France but the outnumbered Dutch outsailed both of them, and King Charles II ran short of money and political support. The Dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until 1713. The British gained the thriving colony of [[New Netherland]], which was renamed as the [[Province of New York]].<ref>James Rees Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch wars of the seventeenth century'' (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0582056306 online]</ref><ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"The role of mercantilism in Anglo\u2010Dutch political relations, 1650\u201374.\" ''Economic History Review'' 63#3 (2010): 591\u2013611.</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\nThe Stuart period began in 1603 with the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and the accession of King James I.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in Sicily (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating leniency in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Primary sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[Punic War]]s{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} He was on the staff of [[Scipio Aemilianus]] when he led a Roman army during the [[Third Punic War]] on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War.{{sfn|Champion|2015|pp=108\u2013109}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in|lk=out}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]], who was one of several Carthaginian [[Hanno]]s known as \"the great\", was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled. These exactions were harshly enforced, causing extreme hardship in many areas.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=114}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Troupes carthaginoises Arverniales 2012.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=A group of men dressed in clothes and carrying weapons from the 3rd century BC accompanying a medium-sized elephant|{{center|Modern recreations of Carthaginian soldiers and a [[war elephant]] at the 2012 [[Gergovie plateau#Events#Les Arverniales|Arverniales]] [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]}}]]\n\nCarthaginian armies were nearly always composed of foreigners; citizens only served in the army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}} [[Ancient Libyans|Libyans]] provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spears{{snd}}both were noted for their discipline and staying power.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gisco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gisco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island.

It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras (Numidian)|Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gisco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifixion|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again. The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe historian Dexter Hoyos writes that \"the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage's domestic fortunes and military orientation\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} Miles agrees there was \"a period of profound political transformation\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=214}} The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=211}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=213}} The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the [[Barcid]] family. Immediately after the war Hamilcar led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in southern [[Carthaginian Iberia|Iberia]]; this was to become a semi-autonomous Barcid fiefdom.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=216, 225}}{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar's son, Hannibal, was to lead Carthage to war in the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=152\u2013155}}|group=note}}  In 218 BC a Carthaginian army under [[Hannibal Barca]] besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia and ignited the Second Punic War.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*''[[Salammb\u00f4]]'': the novel by [[Gustave Flaubert]] set during the war.\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Craige B. \n|last=Champion\n|chapter=Polybius and the Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages=95\u2013110\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite web\n|url=\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/9781119099000.wbabat0270\n|title=The First Punic War and After, 264\u2013237 BC\n|last= Eckstein\n|first=Arthur\n|date=2017\n|website=The Encyclopedia of Ancient Battles\n|publisher=Wiley Online Library\n|access-date=12 March 2020\n|doi=\n|ref=harv }}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage on [[Sicily]] during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in Sicily (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating leniency in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty.

Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]], to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gisco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gisco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal.

An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles.

Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a [[Ruse de guerre|stratagem]], and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force.

He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gisco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners.

The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed.

They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]]{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]], of Second Punic War fame.|group=note}} was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were [[crucifixion|crucified]] in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together.

The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy.

Along with Liberty, the other members of that team included [[Nick Anderson]], [[Kendall Gill]], [[Stephen Bardo]], [[Kenny Battle]], and [[Lowell Hamilton]]. He was then selected by the [[Denver Nuggets]] in the 2nd round (42nd overall) of the [[1990 NBA Draft]]. A 6'8\" (2.03 m) and 205&nbsp;lb (93&nbsp;kg) [[small forward]], Liberty played for the Nuggets and [[Detroit Pistons]] in 4 NBA seasons.
