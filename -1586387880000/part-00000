His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor. Subsequently, Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show, ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]''. In August 2008, Hamilton co-starred in ''Coma'', a web series on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Madsen, George Hamilton and Paul Ben-Victor Star in Coma, an Original Web Series Premiering On Crackle.com|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73148|publisher=webwire.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[My One and Only (film)|My One and Only]]'', which is loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother.\n\nHamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009&nbsp;\u2013 his 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |title=Content Marketing Platform - B2B and B2C Content Marketing Technology - NewsCred |publisher=Daylife.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070010/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508121758/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars+dedicated+by+date.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=May 8, 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me out of Here!

It is part of the [[University of South Carolina System]] and one of the four regional USC campuses which make up [[Palmetto College]]. USC Union is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and awards associate degrees.  Between 500 and 600 students attend one of its two campuses.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, the citizens of [[Union, South Carolina|Union]] formed the Union County Commission for Higher Education to attract a college to their area.  The [[University of South Carolina]] sought to expand its reach throughout the state and agreed to build an extension campus in Union.  Classes began at the campus in 1965 with an initial enrollment of 51 students.  The campus currently includes multiple buildings in Union as well as a branch campus in [[Laurens, South Carolina|Laurens]] at 507 N.
