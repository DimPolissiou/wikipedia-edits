The Hawks played out of [[Beaton Park Stadium]], commonly known as \"The Snakepit\". In 1981, import Mike Jones was named [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Most Valuable Player]]. In 1987, the Hawks had their best season to date, finishing in third place with a 20\u20136 record. In 1998, the team was renamed the '''Wollongong Hawks''' and moved into [[WIN Entertainment Centre]].\n\nThe 2000/01 season marked history for the Hawks as they won their maiden NBL Championship. Prior to the start of the season, coach [[Brendan Joyce]] changed almost half his roster, adding Charles Thomas, Damon Lowery, Grant Kruger, Matt Shanahan and Axel Dench. After finishing the regular season in fourth with a club-best 21 wins from 28 games, Wollongong upset Perth in the first round of the post-season before conquering Adelaide when Lowery sunk three free throws with no time on the clock in game three of the semi-final series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrow|first=Tim|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/3748942/lowery-believes-in-hawks-title-destiny/|title=Lowery believes in Hawks\u2019 title destiny|work=illawarramercury.com.au|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> The Hawks went on to beat Townsville 2\u20131 in the grand final to capture the team's only title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkshistory.com.au/team-list/200001-wollongong-hawks-nbl-champions.html|title=2000/01 - Wollongong Hawks : NBL Champions|work=hawkshistory.com.au|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawks returned to the NBL Grand Final in 2004/05, where they lost to the [[Sydney Kings]].\n\nIn February 2009, captain [[Mat Campbell]] started the \"Save the Hawks\" campaign after the ownership group declared the team would not be able to join revamped league in 2009/10 on financial grounds. Campbell and his small team reached their goal, thanks to the commitment of the Illawarra community, naming rights sponsor ahm Health Insurance, and a bank guarantee provided by Indian mining magnate Mr. Arun Jagatramka from Gujarat NRE. A not-for-profit community-based company formed as Wollongong Hawks Basketball Limited was established to operate the Hawks into the future.\n\nIn 2009/10, they made their third appearance in the grand final series, this time coming up short to the [[Perth Wildcats]]. In 2010/11, import [[Gary Ervin]] was named MVP of the league, becoming the first Hawk to win the award since Mike Jones in 1981. In 2013/14, import [[Rotnei Clarke]] was named MVP of the league, becoming the third Hawk to win the award.\n\nIn July 2014, a new era was ushered in by the Hawks after Telecommunications entrepreneur James Spenceley was successful in his bid to become the organisation's new owner.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hawks.com.au/article/id/19jm5dn0u59xt1svgxiqpzidg3 |title=Hawks under new Ownership |access-date=22 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102633/http://www.hawks.com.au/article/id/19jm5dn0u59xt1svgxiqpzidg3 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, following a dismal 2014/15 season, the organisation was dealt a substantial off-court blow with Wollongong Coal withdrawing their major sponsorship 1\u00bd years into a five-year contract.

He nabbed the trio of New Zealand sharp shooter [[Kirk Penney]], big man [[Andrew Ogilvy|AJ Ogilvy]], and US point guard [[Kevin Lisch]]. The trio were dubbed \"the three-headed monster\",<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-13/hawks-rebuild-to-become-playoff-contenders/7085668 Illawarra Hawks on how they got their wings back]</ref> but they were unsuccessful in leading the Hawks to a championship, falling short in the semi-finals. Lisch was named MVP of the league, becoming the fourth Hawk to win the award.\n\nWith Lisch and Penney departing after one season, the Hawks reacquired the serves of Rotnei Clarke for the 2016/17 season. He helped them reach the NBL Grand Final for the first time since 2010, where they were defeated 3\u20130 by the Perth Wildcats.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, high school phenom [[LaMelo Ball]] announced on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[The Jump (ESPN talk show)|The Jump]]'' that he will sign with the Illawarra Hawks.<ref>https://twitter.com/espn/status/1140707084868210695</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Illawarra Hawks Sign Lamelo Ball |url=http://www.hawks.com.au/news/article/illawarra-hawks-sign-lamelo-ball |publisher=Illawarra Hawks |accessdate=June 17, 2019 |date=June 17, 2019}}</ref> Ball became the second high school phenom to enter the NBL's Next Stars program for the 2019\u201320 NBL season, with [[R.

The logo consists of a red hawk with smaller text \"Illawarra\" centered above the larger text of \"Hawks\". The Hawk is holding a basketball in its talons. Predominately red uniforms are used for home games, and predominately white uniforms for away games.\n\n== Home arenas ==\nThe Illawarra Hawks play their home games at [[WIN Entertainment Centre]], [[Wollongong]]. WIN Entertainment Centre opened in September 1998 with a concert by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Patti Smith]]. It holds a capacity of 6,000 seats when in full basketball format. The Illawarra Hawks are the only full-time tenants at the arena. The Hawks have been playing at the arena since the [[1998\u201399 NBL season]].\n\nPrior to this season, the Hawks played out of the 2,000 seat [[Beaton Park Stadium]] (also known as the '''Illawarra Basketball Stadium''') for twenty seasons starting from the club's inception in 1979. One story that evolved around the NBL during the 1980s was that the [[Illawarra Steelers]] [[rugby league]] team would sit behind the opposition bench during Hawks home games at Beaton Park in a bid to intimidate the opposing team. The Hawks continue to use the stadium as a training facility and also play some pre-season games there.\n\nThe Hawks record home attendance of 5,839 was set on 18 February 2005 against the [[Sydney Kings]] at the WIN Entertainment Centre during Round 21 of the [[2004\u201305 NBL season]].\n\n* [[Beaton Park Stadium]] (1979\u20131998)\n* [[WIN Entertainment Centre]] (1998\u2013present)\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Retired jerseys ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"background:red; color:white\" colspan=4| Illawarra Hawks retired numbers\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:60px\"|{{Tooltip|No.|Number}}\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:180px\"|Player\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:120px\"|Position\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:250px\"|{{Tooltip|Seasons|Seasons played for Hawks}}\n|-\n| '''4''' || Chuck Harmison || [[Forward (basketball)|F]]/[[Center (basketball)|C]] || 1988\u20131996\n|-\n| '''5''' ||[[Gordon McLeod (basketball)|Gordie McLeod]] || [[Guard (basketball)|G]]|| 1979\u20131982, 1984\u20131988\n|-\n| '''12''' ||[[Glen Saville]] || [[Swingman|G/F]] || 1995\u20132007, 2008\u20132013\n|-\n| '''32''' ||[[Mat Campbell]] || [[Swingman|G/F]] || 1996\u20132012\n|-\n| '''33''' ||Melvin Thomas || [[Forward (basketball)|F]] ||1992\u20131995, 1999\u20132003\n|}\n\nSource: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150628214317/http://www.hawks.com.au/retired-numbers Retired Numbers]\n\n=== Current roster ===\n<section begin=roster />{{Basketball roster nationality note}}\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n|team=Illawarra Hawks}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 1 | nat = USA | first = LaMelo | last = Ball | m = 1.98 | kgs = 82 | note = NS | inj = yes }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 10 | nat = AUS | first = Angus | last = Glover | m = 1.93 | kgs = 87 }}\n{{player3 | pos = F/C | num = 17 | nat = AUS | first = Sam | last = Froling | m = 2.12 | kgs = 104 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 21 | nat = AUS | first = Todd | last = Blanchfield | m = 2.00 | kgs = 94 | note = C }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 41 | nat = AUS | first = Emmett | last = Naar | m = 1.85 | kgs = 88 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 44 | nat = AUS | first = Sunday | last = Dech | m = 1.95 | kgs = 93 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Matt Flinn}}\n| asst_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Ben Bagoly}}\n* {{player||USA|Eric Cooks}}\n* {{player||AUS|[[Tyson Demos]]}}\n| DP = y\n| NS = y\n| I = y\n| roster_url = http://www.hawks.com.au/stats#players-stats\n| accessdate = 12 March 2020\n}}<section end=roster />\n\n=== Notable players ===\n{{Basketball notable players criteria}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[David Andersen]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Adam Ballinger]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Todd Blanchfield]]\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Josh Boone (basketball)|Josh Boone]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Ray Borner]]\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[C.

'''Charlie Ammit''' was the first coach of the Hawks to take the team to a finals series when his side finished fourth in the regular season with a 13-11 record. '''Brendan Joyce''' was the first coach to both win the Championship (in [[2000\u201301 NBL season|2000\u201301]]) and claim runners-up (in [[2004\u201305 NBL season|2004\u201305]]). He was also the first coach to claim runners-up in the regular season (in [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304]]). Both Joyce (2004\u201305) and [[Gordon McLeod (basketball)|Gordie McLeod]] (2009\u201310) have the unfortunate honour of claiming the runners-up prize in both the regular season and finals series in the same year. '''Eric Cooks''' became the first captain of the club (1999\u201300) to also become a coach (2006\u20132009). McLeod is the only other captain (1980\u20131982 and 1984\u20131988) to have accomplished this when took over from Cooks in 2009.\n  \n==Season by season==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Division \n!rowspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Post-Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Head Coach\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Captain\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club MVP\n|-\n!

The Hawks played out of [[Beaton Park Stadium]], commonly known as \"The Snakepit\". In 1981, import Mike Jones was named [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL Most Valuable Player]]. In 1987, the Hawks had their best season to date, finishing in third place with a 20\u20136 record. In 1998, the team was renamed the '''Wollongong Hawks''' and moved into [[WIN Entertainment Centre]].\n\nThe 2000/01 season marked history for the Hawks as they won their maiden NBL Championship. Prior to the start of the season, coach [[Brendan Joyce]] changed almost half his roster, adding Charles Thomas, Damon Lowery, Grant Kruger, Matt Shanahan and Axel Dench. After finishing the regular season in fourth with a club-best 21 wins from 28 games, Wollongong upset Perth in the first round of the post-season before conquering Adelaide when Lowery sunk three free throws with no time on the clock in game three of the semi-final series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrow|first=Tim|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/3748942/lowery-believes-in-hawks-title-destiny/|title=Lowery believes in Hawks\u2019 title destiny|work=illawarramercury.com.au|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> The Hawks went on to beat Townsville 2\u20131 in the grand final to capture the team's only title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkshistory.com.au/team-list/200001-wollongong-hawks-nbl-champions.html|title=2000/01 - Wollongong Hawks : NBL Champions|work=hawkshistory.com.au|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawks returned to the NBL Grand Final in 2004/05, where they lost to the [[Sydney Kings]].\n\nIn February 2009, captain [[Mat Campbell]] started the \"Save the Hawks\" campaign after the ownership group declared the team would not be able to join revamped league in 2009/10 on financial grounds. Campbell and his small team reached their goal, thanks to the commitment of the Illawarra community, naming rights sponsor ahm Health Insurance, and a bank guarantee provided by Indian mining magnate Mr. Arun Jagatramka from Gujarat NRE. A not-for-profit community-based company formed as Wollongong Hawks Basketball Limited was established to operate the Hawks into the future.\n\nIn 2009/10, they made their third appearance in the grand final series, this time coming up short to the [[Perth Wildcats]]. In 2010/11, import [[Gary Ervin]] was named MVP of the league, becoming the first Hawk to win the award since Mike Jones in 1981. In 2013/14, import [[Rotnei Clarke]] was named MVP of the league, becoming the third Hawk to win the award.\n\nIn July 2014, a new era was ushered in by the Hawks after Telecommunications entrepreneur James Spenceley was successful in his bid to become the organisation's new owner.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hawks.com.au/article/id/19jm5dn0u59xt1svgxiqpzidg3 |title=Hawks under new Ownership |access-date=22 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102633/http://www.hawks.com.au/article/id/19jm5dn0u59xt1svgxiqpzidg3 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, following a dismal 2014/15 season, the organisation was dealt a substantial off-court blow with Wollongong Coal withdrawing their major sponsorship 1\u00bd years into a five-year contract.

The Illawarra Hawks are the only full-time tenants at the arena. The Hawks have been playing at the arena since the [[1998\u201399 NBL season]].\n\nPrior to this season, the Hawks played out of the 2,000 seat [[Beaton Park Stadium]] (also known as the '''Illawarra Basketball Stadium''') for twenty seasons starting from the club's inception in 1979. One story that evolved around the NBL during the 1980s was that the [[Illawarra Steelers]] [[rugby league]] team would sit behind the opposition bench during Hawks home games at Beaton Park in a bid to intimidate the opposing team. The Hawks continue to use the stadium as a training facility and also play some pre-season games there.\n\nThe Hawks record home attendance of 5,839 was set on 18 February 2005 against the [[Sydney Kings]] at the WIN Entertainment Centre during Round 21 of the [[2004\u201305 NBL season]].\n\n* [[Beaton Park Stadium]] (1979\u20131998)\n* [[WIN Entertainment Centre]] (1998\u2013present)\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Retired jerseys ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"background:red; color:white\" colspan=4| Illawarra Hawks retired numbers\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:60px\"|{{Tooltip|No.|Number}}\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:180px\"|Player\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:120px\"|Position\n! style=\"background:white; color:#EC2227; width:250px\"|{{Tooltip|Seasons|Seasons played for Hawks}}\n|-\n| '''4''' || Chuck Harmison || [[Forward (basketball)|F]]/[[Center (basketball)|C]] || 1988\u20131996\n|-\n| '''5''' ||[[Gordon McLeod (basketball)|Gordie McLeod]] || [[Guard (basketball)|G]]|| 1979\u20131982, 1984\u20131988\n|-\n| '''12''' ||[[Glen Saville]] || [[Swingman|G/F]] || 1995\u20132007, 2008\u20132013\n|-\n| '''32''' ||[[Mat Campbell]] || [[Swingman|G/F]] || 1996\u20132012\n|-\n| '''33''' ||Melvin Thomas || [[Forward (basketball)|F]] ||1992\u20131995, 1999\u20132003\n|}\n\nSource: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150628214317/http://www.hawks.com.au/retired-numbers Retired Numbers]\n\n=== Current roster ===\n<section begin=roster />{{Basketball roster nationality note}}\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n|team=Illawarra Hawks}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 1 | nat = USA | first = LaMelo | last = Ball | m = 1.98 | kgs = 82 | note = NS | inj = yes }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 10 | nat = AUS | first = Angus | last = Glover | m = 1.93 | kgs = 87 }}\n{{player3 | pos = F/C | num = 17 | nat = AUS | first = Sam | last = Froling | m = 2.12 | kgs = 104 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 21 | nat = AUS | first = Todd | last = Blanchfield | m = 2.00 | kgs = 94 | note = C }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 41 | nat = AUS | first = Emmett | last = Naar | m = 1.85 | kgs = 88 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 44 | nat = AUS | first = Sunday | last = Dech | m = 1.95 | kgs = 93 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Matt Flinn}}\n| asst_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Ben Bagoly}}\n* {{player||USA|Eric Cooks}}\n* {{player||AUS|[[Tyson Demos]]}}\n| DP = y\n| NS = y\n| I = y\n| roster_url = http://www.hawks.com.au/stats#players-stats\n| accessdate = 12 March 2020\n}}<section end=roster />\n\n=== Notable players ===\n{{Basketball notable players criteria}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[David Andersen]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Adam Ballinger]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Todd Blanchfield]]\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Josh Boone (basketball)|Josh Boone]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Ray Borner]]\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]]\n* {{flagicon|AUS}} [[C.

'''Brendan Joyce''' was the first coach to both win the Championship (in [[2000\u201301 NBL season|2000\u201301]]) and claim runners-up (in [[2004\u201305 NBL season|2004\u201305]]). He was also the first coach to claim runners-up in the regular season (in [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304]]). Both Joyce (2004\u201305) and [[Gordon McLeod (basketball)|Gordie McLeod]] (2009\u201310) have the unfortunate honour of claiming the runners-up prize in both the regular season and finals series in the same year. '''Eric Cooks''' became the first captain of the club (1999\u201300) to also become a coach (2006\u20132009). McLeod is the only other captain (1980\u20131982 and 1984\u20131988) to have accomplished this when took over from Cooks in 2009.\n  \n==Season by season==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Division \n!rowspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Post-Season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Head Coach\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Captain\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club MVP\n|-\n!

Social entrepreneurs, however, are either [[non-profit organization |non-profits]], or they blend for-profit goals with generating a positive \"return to society\". Therefore, they use different metrics.

For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless.\n\nIn the 2010s social entrepreneurship was facilitated by the use of the [[Internet]], particularly [[social networking]] and [[social media]] websites. These [[website]]s enable social entrepreneurs to reach numerous people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to [[collaboration |collaborate]] online, learn about the issues, disseminate information about the group's events and activities, and raise funds through [[crowdfunding]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2019}}\n\n== Modern definition ==\n[[File:Yunus Social entrepreneurs Sanwar Uddin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Grameen Bank]] founder and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] (left) with two young social entrepreneurs (right)]]\nIn the 2000s, scholars and practitioners have debated which individuals or organizations can be considered to be social entrepreneurs. Thus far, there has been no firm consensus on the definition of social entrepreneurship, as so many different fields, disciplines and organization types are associated with social entrepreneurship, ranging from for-profit businesses to hybrid models combining charitable work with business activities, to non-profit charities, voluntary sector organizations and non-governmental organizations. Philanthropists, social activists, environmentalists, and other socially-oriented practitioners are often referred to as social entrepreneurs.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs can include a range of career types and professional backgrounds, ranging from [[social work]] and [[community development]] to [[entrepreneurship]] and [[environmental science]]. For this reason, it is difficult to determine who is a social entrepreneur. [[David Bornstein (author)|David Bornstein]] has even used the term \"social innovator\" interchangeably with social entrepreneur, due to the creative, non-traditional strategies that many social entrepreneurs use.<ref>David Bornstein, \"''How to Change the World''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 1, 92</ref> For a clearer definition of what social entrepreneurship entails, it is necessary to set the function of social entrepreneurship apart from other voluntary sector and charity-oriented activities and identify the boundaries within which social entrepreneurs operate.<ref>Abu-Saifan, S. 2012. [http://www.timreview.ca/article/523 Social Entrepreneurship: Definition and Boundaries]. [http://www.timreview.ca/ Technology Innovation Management Review]. [http://www.timreview.ca/issue/2012/february February 2012]: 22-27.</ref> Some scholars have advocated restricting the term to founders of organizations that primarily rely on earned income (meaning income earned directly from paying consumers), rather than income from donations or grants. Others have extended this to include contracted work for public authorities, while still others include grants and donations.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship in modern society offers an altruistic form of entrepreneurship that focuses on the benefits that society may reap.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Simply put, entrepreneurship becomes a social endeavor when it transforms [[social capital]] in a way that affects society positively.<ref name=\"Alvord\">Alvord, Sarah H., Brown, David L., and Letts, Christine W. \"Social Entrepreneurship and Societal Transformation: An Exploratory Study.\" The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science. no. 3 (2004): 260-282.</ref> It is viewed as advantageous because the success of social entrepreneurship depends on many factors related to social impact that traditional corporate businesses do not prioritize. Social entrepreneurs recognize immediate social problems, but also seek to understand the broader context of an issue that crosses disciplines, fields, and theories.<ref name=\"Alvord\" /> Gaining a larger understanding of how an issue relates to society allows social entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions and mobilize available resources to affect the greater global society. Unlike traditional corporate businesses, social entrepreneurship ventures focus on maximizing gains in social satisfaction, rather than maximizing profit gains.<ref name=\"Baron\">Baron, David P. \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship.\" Journal of Economics & Management Strategy. no. 3 (2007): 683-717.</ref> Both private and public agencies worldwide have had billion-dollar initiatives to empower deprived communities and individuals.<ref name=\"Alvord\" /> Such support from organizations in society, such as government-aid agencies or private firms, may catalyze innovative ideas to reach a larger audience.\n\nProminent individuals associated with social entrepreneurship include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]] and Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], a leader of [[social entrepreneurship in South Asia]]. Yunus was the founder of [[Grameen Bank]], which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.<ref name=\":0\" /> He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.

Not only do entrepreneurs have an idea that they must implement, they know how to implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, \"Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124 124\u2013126]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124}}</ref> This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the future will look like and a drive to make this come true.

Most entrepreneurs have not studied the skills needed to implement their ideas. Instead, they bring a team of qualified people around themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/21 21]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/21}}</ref> It is the idea that draws this team.\n\nEthical fiber is important because leaders who are about to change the world must be trustworthy. Drayton described this to his employees by suggesting that they picture a situation that frightens them and then place the candidate in the situation with them. If they feel comfortable in this scenario, the entrepreneur has ethical fiber.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/127 127\u2013128]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/127}}</ref> One distinguishing attribute of entrepreneurs is that they rarely take credit for making change. They insist that the change they have brought about is due to everyone around them. They also tend to be driven by emotion; they are not trying primarily to make a profit but to address suffering.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/12 12, 23]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/12}}</ref> Muhammad Yunus says about this characteristic, \"He (or she) competes in the marketplace with all other competitors but is inspired by a set of social objectives.

First, social entrepreneurs are trying to predict, address, and creatively respond to future problems.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 86</ref> Unlike most business entrepreneurs, who address current market deficiencies, social entrepreneurs tackle hypothetical, unseen or often less-researched issues, such as overpopulation, unsustainable energy sources, food shortages.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 86-115</ref> Founding successful social businesses on merely potential solutions can be nearly impossible as investors are much less willing to support risky ventures.\n\nThe lack of eager investors leads to the second problem in social entrepreneurship: the pay gap. Elkington and Hartigan note that \u201cthe salary gap between commercial and social enterprises\u2026 remains the elephant in the room, curtailing the capacity of [social enterprises] to achieve long-term success and viability.\u201d<ref name=\"Unreasonable People p. 201\">The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 201</ref> Social entrepreneurs and their employees are often given diminutive or non-existent salaries, especially at the onset of their ventures. Thus, their enterprises struggle to maintain qualified, committed employees. Though social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's most pressing issues, they must also confront skepticism and stinginess from the very society they seek to serve.<ref name=\"Unreasonable People p. 201\"/>\n\nAnother reason social entrepreneurs are often unsuccessful is because they typically offer help to those least able to pay for it. Capitalism is founded upon the exchange of capital (most obviously, money) for goods and services. However, social entrepreneurs must find new business models that do not rely on standard exchange of capital in order to make their organizations sustainable.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 200</ref> This self-sustainability is what distinguishes social businesses from charities, who rely almost entirely on donations and outside funding.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 31-</ref>\n\n==History==\nSocial entrepreneurship is distinct from the concept of entrepreneurship, yet still shares several similarities with its business cousin. [Jean-Baptiste Say] (1767\u20131832), a French economist, defined an entrepreneur as a person who \"undertakes\" an idea and shifts perspectives in a way that it alters the effect that an idea has on society.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Osberg | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Social entrepreneurship: The case for definition | url = | journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 28\u201339 }}</ref> An entrepreneur is further defined by Say as someone who \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield.\"<ref>Peter F. Drucker, ''Innovation and Entrepreneurship'' (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 21</ref> The difference between \"entrepreneurship\" and \"social entrepreneurship\", however, stems from the purpose of a creation. Social entrepreneurs seek to transform societies at large, rather than transforming their [[profit margin]], as classic entrepreneurs typically seek to do. Social entrepreneurs use a variety of resources to bring societies into a better state of well-being.\n\nThe concept of \"social entrepreneurship\" is not a novel idea, but in the 2000s, it has become more popular among society and academic research, notably after the publication of \"The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur\" by [[Charles Leadbeater]].<ref name=\"Wee\">Wee-Liang, Williams, John, and Tan, Teck-Meng. \"Defining the \u2018Social\u2019 in \u2018Social Entrepreneurship\u2019: Altruism and Entrepreneurship.\" The International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal. no. 3 (2005): 353-365.</ref> Many activities related to community development and higher social purpose fall within the modern definition of social entrepreneurship. Despite the established definition nowadays, social entrepreneurship remains a difficult concept to define, since it may be manifested in multiple forms.<ref name=\"Mair\">Mair, Johanna, and Marti, Ignasi. \"Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight.\" Journal of World Business.no. 1 (2006): 36-44.</ref> A broad definition of the concept allows interdisciplinary research efforts to understand and challenge the notions behind social entrepreneurship. No matter in which sector of society certain organizations are (i.e. corporations or unincorporated associations, societies, associations or [[cooperative]]s), social entrepreneurship focuses on the social impact that an endeavor aims at.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Whether social entrepreneurship is [[altruistic]] or not is less important than the effect it has on society.\n\nThe terms ''social entrepreneur'' and ''social entrepreneurship'' were used first in the literature in 1953 by H. Bowen in his book ''Social Responsibilities of the Businessman''.<ref>For example, the phrase was used as a description of [[Howard Bowen]], ''Social Responsibilities of the Businessman'', America, 1953</ref> The terms came into widespread use in the 1980s and 1990s, promoted by [[Bill Drayton]],<ref name=\"social entreprenuer\">{{cite web | publisher=[[US News & World Report]] | title=The Social Entrepreneur Bill Drayton| date = 2005-10-31 | url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31drayton.htm | accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> Charles Leadbeater, and others.<ref>'The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur, Demos, London, 1996</ref> From the 1950s to the 1990s, the politician [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] was a leading promoter of social entrepreneurship and in the 1980s, he was described by Professor [[Daniel Bell]] at Harvard University as the \"world's most successful entrepreneur of social enterprises\". Young created more than sixty new organizations worldwide, including the [[School for Social Entrepreneurs]] (SSE) which exists in the UK, Australia, and Canada and which supports individuals to realize their potential and to establish, scale, and sustain, social enterprises and [[social business]]es. Another notable British social entrepreneur is [[Andrew Mawson, Baron Mawson|Andrew Mawson]] [[OBE]], who was given a peerage in 2007 because of his [[urban regeneration]] work including the [[Bromley by Bow Centre]] in East London. Although the terms are relatively new, social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship may be found throughout history. A list of a few noteworthy people whose work exemplifies the modern definition of \"social entrepreneurship\" includes [[Florence Nightingale]], founder of the first [[nursing school]] and developer of modern nursing practices; [[Robert Owen]], founder of the [[cooperative]] movement; and [[Vinoba Bhave]], founder of India's [[Bhoodan movement|Land Gift Movement]]. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some of the most successful social entrepreneurs straddled the civic, governmental and business worlds. These pioneers promoted new ideas that were taken up by mainstream public services in welfare, schools and health care.\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n=== Major organizations ===\n[[File:Panel on social entrepreneurs at Spotlight Health Aspen Ideas Festival 2015.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A panel discusses social entrepreneurship in the health care sector in 2015.]]\nGroups focused on social entrepreneurship may be divided into several categories: community-based enterprises, socially responsible enterprises, [[social services]] industry professionals, and socio-economic enterprises.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Community-based enterprises are based on the social ventures aimed at and involving an entire community. These enterprises build on the community's culture and capital (e.g., volunteer resources, financing, in-kind donations, etc.) to empower the enterprise and the community.<ref name=\"Peredo\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peredo | first1 = Ana Maria | last2 = Chrisman | first2 = James J. | year = 2006 | title = Toward a theory of community-based enterprise | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 309\u2013328 | doi=10.5465/amr.2006.20208683}}</ref> Socially responsible enterprises focus on creating [[sustainable development]] through their inside organization acts that focus mostly on creating societal gains for the community.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Social service industry professionals such as [[social worker]]s and [[public health nurse]]s work in [[social services]], either for a government or a non-profit organization. They aim to expand [[social capital]] for individuals, communities, and organizations. Socio-economic enterprises include corporations that balance earning profits with nonprofit goals, such as seeking social change for communities. Some social entrepreneurship organizations are not enterprises in a business sense; instead, they may be charities, non-profit organizations or voluntary sector organizations.\n\nIn addition, there are support organizations dedicated to empowering social entrepreneurs, connecting them with [[mentor]]s, strengthening their enterprise models, and preparing them for [[capital investment]]s. These [[Business incubator|incubators]] and [[Business accelerator|accelerator]] organizations provide office and meeting space (often free), [[mentoring]] and coaching for social enterprise founders and leaders to help them develop their enterprises by improving the effectiveness of their business model, marketing, and strategy. Some accelerator organizations help social entrepreneur leaders to scale up their organization, either by taking it from a local scale to a national scale or from a national scale to a global scale. Some [[entrepreneurship]] support organizations also provide mentoring and coaching to social entrepreneurs.\n\nOne well-known [[Social entrepreneurship in South Asia|social entrepreneur from South Asia]] is [[Muhammad Yunus]], who founded the [[Grameen Bank]] in 1976. He is known as the \"father of [[microcredit]],\" and established the [[microfinance]] movement, which aims to help millions of people rural communities to access small loans.<ref name=\":0\" /> For his work, he was awarded a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2006.<ref name=\"GB Nobel\">{{cite web | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2006 | year = 2006 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/ | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The work that Yunus did through Grameen Bank has been described as a major influence on later social entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"business-socialventures\">{{cite web | publisher=Changemakers | title=Business-Social Ventures Reaching for Major Impact| date = November 2003 | url=http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm| accessdate=2006-11-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614210056/http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-14}}</ref>  Larger countries in Europe and South America have tended to work more closely with public organizations at both the national and local level.\n\n===Types ===\n\nIn ''[[The Power of Unreasonable People]]'', [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] and [[Pamela Hartigan]] describe social entrepreneurs' business structures as falling under three different models, applicable in different situations and economic climates:\n# ''Leveraged non-profit'': This business model leverages financial and other resources in an innovative way to respond to social needs.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 31</ref>\n# ''Hybrid non-profit'': This organizational structure can take a variety of forms, but is distinctive because the hybrid non-profit is willing to use profit from some activities to sustain its other operations which have a social or community purpose. Hybrid non-profits are often created to deal with [[government failure]]s or [[market failure]]s, as they generate revenue to sustain the operation without requiring loans, grants, and other forms of traditional funding.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg.37</ref>\n# ''Social business venture'': These models are set up as businesses that are designed to create change through social means. Social business ventures evolved through a lack of funding. Social entrepreneurs in this situation were forced to become for-profit ventures, because loans and [[equity financing]] are hard to get for social businesses.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 42</ref>\n\nThere are also a broader range of hybrid profit models, where a conventional business invests some portion of its profits on socially, culturally or environmentally beneficial activities. The term \"[[Philanthropreneurship]]\" has been applied to this type of activity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Corporate employees can also engage in social entrepreneurship, which may or may not be officially sanctioned by the company. This has been described as [[corporate social entrepreneurship]].<ref>Hemingway, Christine A. ''Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: Integrity Within''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013. pg.135 {{ISBN|978-1-107-44719-6}}.</ref>\n\nOne private foundation has staked the ground of more precise lexicon following the [[Newman's Own]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newmansownfoundation.org/|title=Newman's Own Foundation - The Power of Philanthropy to Transform Lives|publisher=}}</ref> model having coined the phrase \"Commercial Philanthropy\" where commercial businesses are held and operated with all net proceeds going to serve social service needs.<ref>[http://commercialphilanthropy.com/ Foundation for Commercial Philanthropy, Inc.]</ref>\n\n==International presence==\nOrganizations such as the [[Skoll Foundation]], the [[Omidyar Network]], the [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]], [[Tasamy]], [[Athgo]], [[New Profit Inc.]], [[National Social Entrepreneurship Forum]], [[Echoing Green]], and [[Center for Science, Technology, and Society|the Global Social Benefit Institute]] among others, promote and providing resources to advance the initiatives of social entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"Mair\" /> The North American organizations tend to have a strongly individualistic stance focused on a handful of exceptional leaders. For example, The Skoll Foundation, created by [[eBay]]'s first president, [[Jeff Skoll]], makes capacity-building \"[[Mezzanine funding|mezzanine level]]\" grants to social entrepreneurial organizations that already have reached a certain level of effectiveness.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425\u2013431 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02120479/file/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Tec.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Role of technology==\nThe Internet, [[social networking websites]] and [[social media]] have been pivotal resources for the success and collaboration of many social entrepreneurs.<ref>Malecki, E. J. (1997). Technology and economic development: the dynamics of local, regional, and national change. ''University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy in Entrepreneurship''.</ref> In the 2000s, the Internet has become especially useful in disseminating information to a wide range of like-minded supporters in short amounts of time, even if these individuals are geographically dispersed. In addition, the Internet allows for the pooling of design resources using [[open source]] principles. Using [[wiki]] models or [[crowdsourcing]] approaches, for example, a social entrepreneur organization can get hundreds of people from across a country (or from multiple countries) to collaborate on joint online projects (e.g., developing a [[business plan]] or a [[marketing]] strategy for a social entrepreneurship venture). These websites help social entrepreneurs to disseminate their ideas to broader audiences, help with the formation and maintenance of [[business networks|networks of like-minded people]] and help to link up potential investors, donors or volunteers with the organization. This enables social entrepreneurs to achieve their goals with little or no start-up capital and little or no \"[[bricks and mortar]]\" facilities (e.g., rented office space). For example, the rise of [[open-source appropriate technology]] as a [[sustainable development]] paradigm enables people all over the world to collaborate on solving local problems, just as [[open source software]] development leverages collaboration from software experts from around the world.\n{{Citation needed|reason=The only citation given does not build a clear correlation between social entrepreneurship and technology and was published 20 years ago.|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Public opinion==\n\n=== Controversy ===\nMany initiatives carried out with social entrepreneurs while innovative, have had problems becoming sustainable and effective initiatives that ultimately were able to branch out and reach the larger society as a whole (versus a small community or group of people). Compromises in social initiatives were developed, which often did not reach large audiences or help larger communities. Since the concept of social entrepreneurship has been popularized in the 2000s, some advocates suggest that there needs to be some standardization of the process in scaling up social endeavors to increase the impact of these ventures across the globe.<ref name=\"Alvord\" />\n\nPolicymakers around the globe may need to learn more about social initiatives, to increase the [[sustainability]], effectiveness, and efficiency of these projects.<ref name=Wee/> Involvement and collaboration between private corporations and government agencies allows for increased support for carrying out social entrepreneurship initiatives, increased accountability on both ends, and increased connections with communities, individuals, or agencies in need. For example, private organizations or nonprofit organizations have tackled [[unemployment]] issues in communities.<ref name=Cook>Cook, Beth, Dodds, Chris, and Mitchell, William. \"Social Entrepreneurship: False \nPremises and Dangerous Forebodings.\" The Australian Journal of Social Issues. no. 1 (2003): 57-72.</ref> One challenge is that in some cases, social entrepreneurs may only propose short-term solutions, or that they are unable to scale up their virtual, online organization to a larger degree to maximize the number of people who are helped.<ref name=Cook/> Government programs are able to tackle large issues; however, there is often little collaboration between governments and social entrepreneurs, which may have limited the effectiveness of social entrepreneurship. This lack of inter-sectoral collaboration may lead to stagnation, if the motives and goals of social enterprises and of those in policy-making and programs are not aligned.<ref name=Drayton>Drayton, William. \"The Citizen Sector: BECOMING AS ENTREPRENEURIAL AND COMPETITIVE AS BUSINESS.\" ''California management review'' 44, no. 3 (2002).</ref> Those in policy-making and the development of delivery of government programs tend to have different priorities than social entrepreneurs, resulting in slow growth and expansion of social initiatives.\n\nSince social entrepreneurship has only started to gain momentum in the 2000s, current social entrepreneurs are encouraging social advocates and activists to develop into innovative social entrepreneurs.<ref name=Drayton/> Increasing the scope and scale of social entrepreneurship may increase the likelihood of an efficient, sustainable, and effective initiative; although it may also render social entrepreneurship more challenging. Increased participation draws more attention to social entrepreneurship ventures from policymakers and privately owned corporations. The increased involvement from corporations and governments may help to strengthen social entrepreneurship, as it may lead to policy changes and to the development of training programs and [[leadership]] development programs for social entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, research shows that as social entrepreneurs attempt to widen their impact and scale their efforts, external institutions will have a key role to play in their success.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sud | first1 = M. | last2 = VanSandt | first2 = C.V. | last3 = Baugous | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Social Entrepreneurship: The Role of Institutions | url =https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=business-facultypubs | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 201\u2013216 | doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9939-1}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Entrepreneurship]]\n* [[Appropriate technology]]\n* [[B Corporation (certification)]]\n* [[Business ethics]]\n* [[Collaborative method]]\n* [[Geotourism]]\n* [[List of social entrepreneurs]]\n* [[Microfranchising]]\n* [[Social innovation]]\n* [[Social venture capital]]\n* [[Triple bottom line]] \u2013 business theory\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Abu-Saifan, S. 2012.

Thus far, there has been no firm consensus on the definition of social entrepreneurship, as so many different fields, disciplines and organization types are associated with social entrepreneurship, ranging from for-profit businesses to hybrid models combining charitable work with business activities, to non-profit charities, voluntary sector organizations and non-governmental organizations. Philanthropists, social activists, environmentalists, and other socially-oriented practitioners are often referred to as social entrepreneurs.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs can include a range of career types and professional backgrounds, ranging from [[social work]] and [[community development]] to [[entrepreneurship]] and [[environmental science]]. For this reason, it is difficult to determine who is a social entrepreneur. [[David Bornstein (author)|David Bornstein]] has even used the term \"social innovator\" interchangeably with social entrepreneur, due to the creative, non-traditional strategies that many social entrepreneurs use.<ref>David Bornstein, \"''How to Change the World''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 1, 92</ref> For a clearer definition of what social entrepreneurship entails, it is necessary to set the function of social entrepreneurship apart from other voluntary sector and charity-oriented activities and identify the boundaries within which social entrepreneurs operate.<ref>Abu-Saifan, S. 2012.

Others have extended this to include contracted work for public authorities, while still others include grants and donations.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship in modern society offers an altruistic form of entrepreneurship that focuses on the benefits that society may reap.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Simply put, entrepreneurship becomes a social endeavor when it transforms [[social capital]] in a way that affects society positively.<ref name=\"Alvord\">Alvord, Sarah H., Brown, David L., and Letts, Christine W. \"Social Entrepreneurship and Societal Transformation: An Exploratory Study.\" The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science. no. 3 (2004): 260-282.</ref> It is viewed as advantageous because the success of social entrepreneurship depends on many factors related to social impact that traditional corporate businesses do not prioritize. Social entrepreneurs recognize immediate social problems, but also seek to understand the broader context of an issue that crosses disciplines, fields, and theories.<ref name=\"Alvord\" /> Gaining a larger understanding of how an issue relates to society allows social entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions and mobilize available resources to affect the greater global society. Unlike traditional corporate businesses, social entrepreneurship ventures focus on maximizing gains in social satisfaction, rather than maximizing profit gains.<ref name=\"Baron\">Baron, David P. \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship.\" Journal of Economics & Management Strategy. no. 3 (2007): 683-717.</ref> Both private and public agencies worldwide have had billion-dollar initiatives to empower deprived communities and individuals.<ref name=\"Alvord\" /> Such support from organizations in society, such as government-aid agencies or private firms, may catalyze innovative ideas to reach a larger audience.\n\nProminent individuals associated with social entrepreneurship include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]] and Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], a leader of [[social entrepreneurship in South Asia]]. Yunus was the founder of [[Grameen Bank]], which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.<ref name=\":0\" /> He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.

Drayton tells his employees to look for four qualities: creativity, entrepreneurial quality, social impact of the idea, and ethical fiber.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/121 121\u2013122]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/121}}</ref> Creativity has two parts: goal-setting and problem-solving. Social entrepreneurs are creative enough to have a vision of what they want to happen and how to make that vision happen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124 124]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124}}</ref> In their book The Power of Unreasonable People John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan identify why social entrepreneurs are, as they put it, unreasonable. They argue that these men and women seek profit in social output where others would not expect profit. They also ignore evidence suggesting that their enterprises will fail and attempt to measure results which no one is equipped to measure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/15 15\u201319]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/15}}</ref> About this, the Schwab Foundation says that entrepreneurs have \"A zeal to measure and monitor their impact. Entrepreneurs have high standards, particularly in relation to their own organization's efforts and in response to the communities with which they engage. Data, both quantitative and qualitative, are their key tools, guiding continuous feedback and improvement.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Social Entrepreneur?|url=http://www.schwabfound.org/content/what-social-entrepreneur|website=Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> Ashoka operates in multiple countries.\n\nEntrepreneurial quality builds from creativity. Not only do entrepreneurs have an idea that they must implemented, they know how to implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, \"Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124 124\u2013126]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/124}}</ref> This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the future will look like and a drive to make this come true. Besides this, entrepreneurs are not happy with the status quo; they want healthy change.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/11 11\u201313]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/11}}</ref> This changemaking process has been described as the creation of market disequilibria through the conversion of antagonistic assets into complementarities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hockerts | first1 = K. | year = 2015 | title = How hybrid organizations turn antagonistic assets into complementarities | journal = California Management Review | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 83\u2013106 | doi = 10.1525/cmr.2015.57.3.83 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Komatsu | first1 = T. | year = 2016 | title =Social Innovation Business Models: Coping with Antagonistic Objectives and Assets| journal = Finance and Economy for Society: Integrating Sustainability | volume = 11 | pages = 315\u2013347 | doi = 10.1108/S2043-905920160000011013 | series = Critical Studies on Corporate Responsibility, Governance and Sustainability | isbn = 978-1-78635-510-2 }}</ref>\n\nSocial impact measures whether the idea itself will be able to cause change after the original founder is gone. If an idea has intrinsic worth, once implemented it will cause change even without the charismatic leadership of the first entrepreneur.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/126 126\u2013127]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/126}}</ref> One reason that these entrepreneurs are unreasonable is that they are unqualified for the task they take on. Most entrepreneurs have not studied the skills needed to implement their ideas. Instead, they bring a team of qualified people around themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/21 21]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/21}}</ref> It is the idea that draws this team.\n\nEthical fiber is important because leaders who are about to change the world must be trustworthy. Drayton described this to his employees by suggesting that they picture a situation that frightens them and then place the candidate in the situation with them. If they feel comfortable in this scenario, the entrepreneur has ethical fiber.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/127 127\u2013128]|url=https://archive.org/details/howtochangeworld00born_0/page/127}}</ref> One distinguishing attribute of entrepreneurs is that they rarely take credit for making change. They insist that the change they have brought about is due to everyone around them. They also tend to be driven by emotion; they are not trying primarily to make a profit but to address suffering.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elkington|first1=John|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|date=2008|publisher=Harvard Business Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4221-0406-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/12 12, 23]|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofunreasona0000elki/page/12}}</ref> Muhammad Yunus says about this characteristic, \"He (or she) competes in the marketplace with all other competitors but is inspired by a set of social objectives.

First, social entrepreneurs are trying to predict, address, and creatively respond to future problems.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 86</ref> Unlike most business entrepreneurs, who address current market deficiencies, social entrepreneurs tackle hypothetical, unseen or often less-researched issues, such as overpopulation, unsustainable energy sources, food shortages.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 86-115</ref> Founding successful social businesses on merely potential solutions can be nearly impossible as investors are much less willing to support risky ventures.\n\nThe lack of eager investors leads to the second problem in social entrepreneurship: the pay gap. Elkington and Hartigan note that \u201cthe salary gap between commercial and social enterprises\u2026 remains the elephant in the room, curtailing the capacity of [social enterprises] to achieve long-term success and viability.\u201d<ref name=\"Unreasonable People p. 201\">The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 201</ref> Social entrepreneurs and their employees are often given diminutive or non-existent salaries, especially at the onset of their ventures. Thus, their enterprises struggle to maintain qualified, committed employees. Though social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's most pressing issues, they must also confront skepticism and stinginess from the very society they seek to serve.<ref name=\"Unreasonable People p. 201\"/>\n\nAnother reason social entrepreneurs are often unsuccessful is because they typically offer help to those least able to pay for it. Capitalism is founded upon the exchange of capital (most obviously, money) for goods and services. However, social entrepreneurs must find new business models that do not rely on standard exchange of capital in order to make their organizations sustainable.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 200</ref> This self-sustainability is what distinguishes social businesses from charities, who rely almost entirely on donations and outside funding.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 31-</ref>\n\n==History==\nSocial entrepreneurship is distinct from the concept of entrepreneurship, yet still shares several similarities with its business cousin. [Jean-Baptiste Say] (1767\u20131832), a French economist, defined an entrepreneur as a person who \"undertakes\" an idea and shifts perspectives in a way that it alters the effect that an idea has on society.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Osberg | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Social entrepreneurship: The case for definition | url = | journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 28\u201339 }}</ref> An entrepreneur is further defined by Say as someone who \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield.\"<ref>Peter F. Drucker, ''Innovation and Entrepreneurship'' (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 21</ref> The difference between \"entrepreneurship\" and \"social entrepreneurship\", however, stems from the purpose of a creation. Social entrepreneurs seek to transform societies at large, rather than transforming their [[profit margin]], as classic entrepreneurs typically seek to do. Social entrepreneurs use a variety of resources to bring societies into a better state of well-being.\n\nThe concept of \"social entrepreneurship\" is not a novel idea, but in the 2000s, it has become more popular among society and academic research, notably after the publication of \"The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur\" by [[Charles Leadbeater]].<ref name=\"Wee\">Wee-Liang, Williams, John, and Tan, Teck-Meng. \"Defining the \u2018Social\u2019 in \u2018Social Entrepreneurship\u2019: Altruism and Entrepreneurship.\" The International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal. no. 3 (2005): 353-365.</ref> Many activities related to community development and higher social purpose fall within the modern definition of social entrepreneurship. Despite the established definition nowadays, social entrepreneurship remains a difficult concept to define, since it may be manifested in multiple forms.<ref name=\"Mair\">Mair, Johanna, and Marti, Ignasi. \"Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight.\" Journal of World Business.no. 1 (2006): 36-44.</ref> A broad definition of the concept allows interdisciplinary research efforts to understand and challenge the notions behind social entrepreneurship. No matter in which sector of society certain organizations are (i.e. corporations or unincorporated associations, societies, associations or [[cooperative]]s), social entrepreneurship focuses on the social impact that an endeavor aims at.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Whether social entrepreneurship is [[altruistic]] or not is less important than the effect it has on society.\n\nThe terms ''social entrepreneur'' and ''social entrepreneurship'' were used first in the literature in 1953 by H. Bowen in his book ''Social Responsibilities of the Businessman''.<ref>For example, the phrase was used as a description of [[Howard Bowen]], ''Social Responsibilities of the Businessman'', America, 1953</ref> The terms came into widespread use in the 1980s and 1990s, promoted by [[Bill Drayton]],<ref name=\"social entreprenuer\">{{cite web | publisher=[[US News & World Report]] | title=The Social Entrepreneur Bill Drayton| date = 2005-10-31 | url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31drayton.htm | accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> Charles Leadbeater, and others.<ref>'The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur, Demos, London, 1996</ref> From the 1950s to the 1990s, the politician [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] was a leading promoter of social entrepreneurship and in the 1980s, he was described by Professor [[Daniel Bell]] at Harvard University as the \"world's most successful entrepreneur of social enterprises\". Young created more than sixty new organizations worldwide, including the [[School for Social Entrepreneurs]] (SSE) which exists in the UK, Australia, and Canada and which supports individuals to realize their potential and to establish, scale, and sustain, social enterprises and [[social business]]es. Another notable British social entrepreneur is [[Andrew Mawson, Baron Mawson|Andrew Mawson]] [[OBE]], who was given a peerage in 2007 because of his [[urban regeneration]] work including the [[Bromley by Bow Centre]] in East London. Although the terms are relatively new, social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship may be found throughout history. A list of a few noteworthy people whose work exemplifies the modern definition of \"social entrepreneurship\" includes [[Florence Nightingale]], founder of the first [[nursing school]] and developer of modern nursing practices; [[Robert Owen]], founder of the [[cooperative]] movement; and [[Vinoba Bhave]], founder of India's [[Bhoodan movement|Land Gift Movement]]. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some of the most successful social entrepreneurs straddled the civic, governmental and business worlds. These pioneers promoted new ideas that were taken up by mainstream public services in welfare, schools and health care.\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n=== Major organizations ===\n[[File:Panel on social entrepreneurs at Spotlight Health Aspen Ideas Festival 2015.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A panel discusses social entrepreneurship in the health care sector in 2015.]]\nGroups focused on social entrepreneurship may be divided into several categories: community-based enterprises, socially responsible enterprises, [[social services]] industry professionals, and socio-economic enterprises.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Community-based enterprises are based on the social ventures aimed at and involving an entire community. These enterprises build on the community's culture and capital (e.g., volunteer resources, financing, in-kind donations, etc.) to empower the enterprise and the community.<ref name=\"Peredo\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peredo | first1 = Ana Maria | last2 = Chrisman | first2 = James J. | year = 2006 | title = Toward a theory of community-based enterprise | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 309\u2013328 | doi=10.5465/amr.2006.20208683}}</ref> Socially responsible enterprises focus on creating [[sustainable development]] through their inside organization acts that focus mostly on creating societal gains for the community.<ref name=\"Wee\" /> Social service industry professionals such as [[social worker]]s and [[public health nurse]]s work in [[social services]], either for a government or a non-profit organization. They aim to expand [[social capital]] for individuals, communities, and organizations. Socio-economic enterprises include corporations that balance earning profits with nonprofit goals, such as seeking social change for communities. Some social entrepreneurship organizations are not enterprises in a business sense; instead, they may be charities, non-profit organizations or voluntary sector organizations.\n\nIn addition, there are support organizations dedicated to empowering social entrepreneurs, connecting them with [[mentor]]s, strengthening their enterprise models, and preparing them for [[capital investment]]s. These [[Business incubator|incubators]] and [[Business accelerator|accelerator]] organizations provide office and meeting space (often free), [[mentoring]] and coaching for social enterprise founders and leaders to help them develop their enterprises by improving the effectiveness of their business model, marketing, and strategy. Some accelerator organizations help social entrepreneur leaders to scale up their organization, either by taking it from a local scale to a national scale or from a national scale to a global scale. Some [[entrepreneurship]] support organizations also provide mentoring and coaching to social entrepreneurs.\n\nOne well-known [[Social entrepreneurship in South Asia|social entrepreneur from South Asia]] is [[Muhammad Yunus]], who founded the [[Grameen Bank]] in 1976. He is known as the \"father of [[microcredit]],\" and established the [[microfinance]] movement, which aims to help millions of people rural communities to access small loans.<ref name=\":0\" /> For his work, he was awarded a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2006.<ref name=\"GB Nobel\">{{cite web | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2006 | year = 2006 | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/ | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The work that Yunus did through Grameen Bank has been described as a major influence on later social entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"business-socialventures\">{{cite web | publisher=Changemakers | title=Business-Social Ventures Reaching for Major Impact| date = November 2003 | url=http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm| accessdate=2006-11-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614210056/http://www.changemakers.net/journal/03november/index.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-14}}</ref>  Larger countries in Europe and South America have tended to work more closely with public organizations at both the national and local level.\n\n===Types ===\n\nIn ''[[The Power of Unreasonable People]]'', [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] and [[Pamela Hartigan]] describe social entrepreneurs' business structures as falling under three different models, applicable in different situations and economic climates:\n# ''Leveraged non-profit'': This business model leverages financial and other resources in an innovative way to respond to social needs.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 31</ref>\n# ''Hybrid non-profit'': This organizational structure can take a variety of forms, but is distinctive because the hybrid non-profit is willing to use profit from some activities to sustain its other operations which have a social or community purpose. Hybrid non-profits are often created to deal with [[government failure]]s or [[market failure]]s, as they generate revenue to sustain the operation without requiring loans, grants, and other forms of traditional funding.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg.37</ref>\n# ''Social business venture'': These models are set up as businesses that are designed to create change through social means. Social business ventures evolved through a lack of funding. Social entrepreneurs in this situation were forced to become for-profit ventures, because loans and [[equity financing]] are hard to get for social businesses.<ref>The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 42</ref>\n\nThere are also a broader range of hybrid profit models, where a conventional business invests some portion of its profits on socially, culturally or environmentally beneficial activities. The term \"[[Philanthropreneurship]]\" has been applied to this type of activity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Corporate employees can also engage in social entrepreneurship, which may or may not be officially sanctioned by the company.

J. (1997). Technology and economic development: the dynamics of local, regional, and national change. ''University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy in Entrepreneurship''.</ref> In the 2000s, the Internet has become especially useful in disseminating information to a wide range of like-minded supporters in short amounts of time, even if these individuals are geographically dispersed. In addition, the Internet allows for the pooling of design resources using [[open source]] principles. Using [[wiki]] models or [[crowdsourcing]] approaches, for example, a social entrepreneur organization can get hundreds of people from across a country (or from multiple countries) to collaborate on joint online projects (e.g., developing a [[business plan]] or a [[marketing]] strategy for a social entrepreneurship venture). These websites help social entrepreneurs to disseminate their ideas to broader audiences, help with the formation and maintenance of [[business networks|networks of like-minded people]] and help to link up potential investors, donors or volunteers with the organization. This enables social entrepreneurs to achieve their goals with little or no start-up capital and little or no \"[[bricks and mortar]]\" facilities (e.g., rented office space). For example, the rise of [[open-source appropriate technology]] as a [[sustainable development]] paradigm enables people all over the world to collaborate on solving local problems, just as [[open source software]] development leverages collaboration from software experts from around the world.\n{{Citation needed|reason=The only citation given does not build a clear correlation between social entrepreneurship and technology and was published 20 years ago.|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Public opinion==\n\n=== Controversy ===\nMany initiatives carried out with social entrepreneurs while innovative, have had problems becoming sustainable and effective initiatives that ultimately were able to branch out and reach the larger society as a whole (versus a small community or group of people). Compromises in social initiatives were developed, which often did not reach large audiences or help larger communities. Since the concept of social entrepreneurship has been popularized in the 2000s, some advocates suggest that there needs to be some standardization of the process in scaling up social endeavors to increase the impact of these ventures across the globe.<ref name=\"Alvord\" />\n\nPolicymakers around the globe may need to learn more about social initiatives, to increase the [[sustainability]], effectiveness, and efficiency of these projects.<ref name=Wee/> Involvement and collaboration between private corporations and government agencies allows for increased support for carrying out social entrepreneurship initiatives, increased accountability on both ends, and increased connections with communities, individuals, or agencies in need. For example, private organizations or nonprofit organizations have tackled [[unemployment]] issues in communities.<ref name=Cook>Cook, Beth, Dodds, Chris, and Mitchell, William. \"Social Entrepreneurship: False \nPremises and Dangerous Forebodings.\" The Australian Journal of Social Issues. no. 1 (2003): 57-72.</ref> One challenge is that in some cases, social entrepreneurs may only propose short-term solutions, or that they are unable to scale up their virtual, online organization to a larger degree to maximize the number of people who are helped.<ref name=Cook/> Government programs are able to tackle large issues; however, there is often little collaboration between governments and social entrepreneurs, which may have limited the effectiveness of social entrepreneurship. This lack of inter-sectoral collaboration may lead to stagnation, if the motives and goals of social enterprises and of those in policy-making and programs are not aligned.<ref name=Drayton>Drayton, William. \"The Citizen Sector: BECOMING AS ENTREPRENEURIAL AND COMPETITIVE AS BUSINESS.\" ''California management review'' 44, no. 3 (2002).</ref> Those in policy-making and the development of delivery of government programs tend to have different priorities than social entrepreneurs, resulting in slow growth and expansion of social initiatives.\n\nSince social entrepreneurship has only started to gain momentum in the 2000s, current social entrepreneurs are encouraging social advocates and activists to develop into innovative social entrepreneurs.<ref name=Drayton/> Increasing the scope and scale of social entrepreneurship may increase the likelihood of an efficient, sustainable, and effective initiative; although it may also render social entrepreneurship more challenging. Increased participation draws more attention to social entrepreneurship ventures from policymakers and privately owned corporations. The increased involvement from corporations and governments may help to strengthen social entrepreneurship, as it may lead to policy changes and to the development of training programs and [[leadership]] development programs for social entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, research shows that as social entrepreneurs attempt to widen their impact and scale their efforts, external institutions will have a key role to play in their success.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sud | first1 = M. | last2 = VanSandt | first2 = C.V. | last3 = Baugous | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Social Entrepreneurship: The Role of Institutions | url =https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=business-facultypubs | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 201\u2013216 | doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9939-1}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Entrepreneurship]]\n* [[Appropriate technology]]\n* [[B Corporation (certification)]]\n* [[Business ethics]]\n* [[Collaborative method]]\n* [[Geotourism]]\n* [[List of social entrepreneurs]]\n* [[Microfranchising]]\n* [[Social innovation]]\n* [[Social venture capital]]\n* [[Triple bottom line]] \u2013 business theory\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Abu-Saifan, S. 2012.

The loader executes the specified [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] program, passing to it as an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script, so that the program may use the file as input data.<ref name=\"linux\">{{cite web|title=execve(2) - Linux man page|url=http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve|accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> For example, if a script is named with the path ''path/to/script'', and it starts with the following line, <code>#!/bin/sh</code>, then the program loader is instructed to run the program ''/bin/sh'', passing ''path/to/script'' as the first argument.\nIn [[Linux]], this behavior is the result of both kernel and user-space code.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Corbet |first1=Jonathan |title=The case of the supersized shebang |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/779997/ |website=LWN.net}}</ref>\n\nThe shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter, because the \"#\" character is a [[Comment (computer programming)|comment]] marker in many scripting languages; some language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to begin comments still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of its purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/|title=SRFI 22}}</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe form of a shebang [[interpreter directive]] is as follows:<ref name=\"linux\" />\n #!''interpreter'' [''optional-arg'']\nin which ''interpreter'' is an [[absolute path]] to an executable program.\n\nThe optional argument is a string representing a single argument. White space after <b style=font-family:monospace;font-size:120%>#!</b> is optional.\n\nIn Linux, the file specified by ''interpreter'' can be executed if it has the execute right and contains code which the kernel can execute directly, if it has a wrapper defined for it via ''sysctl'' (such as for executing Microsoft .EXE binaries using [[wine (software)|wine]]), or if it contains a shebang. On Linux and Minix, an interpreter can also be a script. A chain of shebangs and wrappers yields a directly executable file that gets the encountered scripts as parameters in reverse order. For example, if file ''/bin/A'' is an executable file in ELF format, file ''/bin/B'' contains the shebang ''#!/bin/A optparam'', and file ''/bin/C'' contains the shebang ''#!/bin/B'', then executing file ''/bin/C'' resolves to ''/bin/B /bin/C'', which finally resolves to ''/bin/A optparam /bin/B /bin/C''.\n\nIn [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based operating systems such as [[macOS]], and in [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]],<ref>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45444823/python3-shebang-line-not-working-as-expected</ref> the file specified by ''interpreter'' must be an executable binary, and cannot itself be a script.\n\n==Examples==\nSome typical shebang lines:\n* <code>#!/bin/sh</code> \u2013 Execute the file using the [[Bourne shell]], or a compatible shell, assumed to be in the /bin directory\n* <code>#!/bin/bash</code> \u2013 Execute the file using the [[Bash shell]] \n* <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> \u2013 Execute with a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interpreter, using the program search path to find it\n* <code>#!/bin/false</code> \u2013 Do nothing, but return a non-zero [[exit status]], indicating failure. Used to prevent stand-alone execution of a script file intended for execution in a specific context, such as by the <code>'''.'''</code> command from sh/bash, <code>source</code> from csh/tcsh, or as a .profile, .cshrc, or .login file.\n\nShebang lines may include specific options that are passed to the interpreter. However, implementations vary in the parsing behavior of options; for portability, only one option should be specified without any embedded whitespace. Further portability guidelines are found below.\n\n==Purpose==\nInterpreter directives allow scripts and data files to be used as commands, hiding the details of their implementation from users and other programs, by removing the need to prefix scripts with their interpreter on the command line.\n\nA [[Bourne shell]] script that is identified by the path ''some/path/to/foo'', has the initial line,\n #!/bin/sh -x\nand is executed with parameters ''bar'' and ''baz'' as\n some/path/to/foo bar baz\nprovides a similar result as having actually executed the following command line instead:\n /bin/sh -x some/path/to/foo bar baz\nIf ''/bin/sh'' specifies the [[Bourne shell]], then the end result is that all of the shell commands in the file ''some/path/to/foo'' are executed with the positional variables ''$1'' and ''$2'' having the values ''bar'' and ''baz'', respectively. Also, because the initial [[number sign]] is the character used to introduce comments in the [[Bourne shell]] language (and in the languages understood by many other interpreters), the whole shebang line is ignored by the interpreter.\n\nHowever, it is up to the interpreter to ignore the shebang line; thus, a script consisting of the following two lines simply echos ''both'' lines to [[standard output]] when run:\n #!/bin/cat\n Hello world!\n\n===Strengths===\nWhen compared to the use of global association lists between file extensions and the interpreting applications, the interpreter directive method allows users to use interpreters not known at a global system level, and without administrator rights. It also allows specific selection of interpreter, without overloading the [[filename extension]] [[namespace]] (where one file extension refers to more than one file type), and allows the implementation language of a script to be changed without changing its invocation syntax by other programs. Invokers of the script need not know what the implementation language is as the script itself is responsible for specifying the interpreter to use.\n\n==Portability==\n\n=== Program location ===\nShebangs must specify [[absolute path]]s (or paths relative to current working directory) to system executables; this can cause problems on systems that have a non-standard file system layout. Even when systems have fairly standard paths, it is quite possible for variants of the same operating system to have different locations for the desired interpreter. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], for example, might be in ''/usr/bin/python'', ''/usr/local/bin/python'', or even something like ''/home/username/bin/python'' if installed by an ordinary user.\n\nA similar problem exists for the [[POSIX shell]], since POSIX only required its name to be ''sh'', but did not mandate a path. A common value is {{tt|/bin/sh}}, but some systems such as Solaris have the POSIX-compatible shell at ''/usr/xpg4/bin/sh''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html#tag_20_117_16|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7|year=2008|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> In many [[Linux]] systems and recent releases of [[Mac OS X]], ''/bin/sh'' is a hard or [[symbolic link]] to ''/bin/bash'', the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bourne Again shell]] (BASH). Using bash-specific syntax while maintaining a shebang pointing to ''sh'' is also not portable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/shell_script_mistakes.html|title=pixelbeat.org: Common shell script mistakes|quote=It's much better to test scripts directly in a POSIX compliant shell if possible. The `bash --posix` option doesn't suffice as it still accepts some 'bashisms'}}</ref>\n\nBecause of this it is sometimes required to edit the shebang line after copying a [[script (computer programming)|script]] from one computer to another because the path that was coded into the script may not apply on a new machine, depending on the consistency in past convention of placement of the interpreter. For this reason and because [[POSIX]] does not standardize path names, POSIX does not standardize the feature.\n\nOften, the program {{tt|[[env|/usr/bin/env]]}} can be used to circumvent this limitation by introducing a level of [[indirection]]. {{code|#!}} is followed by {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}, followed by the desired command without full path, as in this example:\n #!/usr/bin/env sh\n\nThis mostly works because the path {{tt|/usr/bin/env}} is commonly used for the {{tt|env}} utility,\nand it invokes the first {{tt|sh}} found in the user's [[PATH (variable)|$PATH]], typically {{tt|/bin/sh}}.\n\nOn a system with setuid script support this will reintroduce the race eliminated by the {{tt|/dev/fd}} workaround described below. There are still some portability issues with [[OpenServer]] 5.0.6 and [[Unicos]] 9.0.2 which have only {{tt|/bin/env}} and no {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}.\n\n=== Character interpretation ===\nAnother portability problem is the interpretation of the command arguments.\nSome systems, including Linux, do not split up the arguments;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2008/11/09/msg002388.html |title=/usr/bin/env behaviour |publisher=Mail-index.netbsd.org |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> for example, when running the script with the first line like,\n #!/usr/bin/env python -c\nThat is, {{code|python -c}} will be passed as one argument to {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}, rather than two arguments. [[Cygwin]] also behaves this way.\n\nComplex interpreter invocations are possible through the use of an additional [[Wrapper function|wrapper]]. FreeBSD 6.0 (2005) introduced a {{tt|-S}} option to its {{tt|env}} as it changed the shebang-reading behavior to non-splitting. This option tells {{tt|env}} to split the string itself.<ref>{{man|1|env|FreeBSD}}</ref> The GNU {{tt|env}} utility since coreutil 8.30 (2018) also includes this feature.<ref>{{cite web |title=env invocation |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.htmll#g_t_002dS_002f_002d_002dsplit_002dstring-usage-in-scripts |website=GNU Coreutils |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> Although using this option mitigates the portability issue on the kernel end with splitting, it adds the requirement that {{tt|env}} supports this particular extension.\n\nAnother problem is scripts containing a [[carriage return]] character immediately after the shebang, perhaps as a result of being edited on a system that uses DOS [[newline|line break]]s, such as [[Microsoft Windows]]. Some systems interpret the carriage return character as part of the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] command, resulting in an error message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://askubuntu.com/questions/372672/what-could-cause-a-script-to-fail-to-find-python-when-it-has-usr-bin-env-pyt/372691#372691 |title=Carriage Return causes bash to fail| date=2013-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Magic number===\nThe shebang is actually a human-readable instance of a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]] in the executable file, the magic byte string being ''{{mono|0x23 0x21}}'', the two-character encoding in [[ASCII]] of {{mono|#!}}. This magic number is detected by the \"[[exec (operating system)|exec]]\" family of functions, which determine whether a file is a script or an executable binary. The presence of the shebang will result in the execution of the specified executable, usually an interpreter for the script's language. It has been claimed that some old versions of Unix expect the normal shebang to be followed by a space and a slash (''{{code|#! /}}''), but this appears to be untrue;{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} rather, blanks after the shebang have traditionally been allowed, and sometimes documented with a space (see the 1980 email in [[#History|history]] section below).\n\nThe shebang characters are represented by the same two bytes in [[extended ASCII]] encodings, including [[UTF-8]], which is commonly used for scripts and other text files on current Unix-like systems. However, UTF-8 files may begin with the optional [[byte order mark]] (BOM); if the \"exec\" function specifically detects the bytes 0x23 and 0x21, then the presence of the BOM ({{mono|0xEF 0xBB 0xBF}}) before the shebang will prevent the script interpreter from being executed. Some authorities recommend against using the byte order mark in [[POSIX]] (Unix-like) scripts,<ref>{{cite web|title = FAQ - UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM: Can a UTF-8 data stream contain the BOM character (in UTF-8 form)? If yes, then can I still assume the remaining UTF-8 bytes are in big-endian order?|url = http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom5|accessdate = 2009-01-04}}</ref> for this reason and for wider interoperability and philosophical concerns. Additionally, a byte order mark is not necessary in UTF-8, as that encoding does not have [[endianness]] issues; it serves only to identify the encoding as UTF-8.\n\n==Etymology==\nAn executable file starting with an interpreter directive is simply called a script, often prefaced with the name or general classification of the intended interpreter.

The loader executes the specified [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] program, passing to it as an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script, so that the program may use the file as input data.<ref name=\"linux\">{{cite web|title=execve(2) - Linux man page|url=http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve|accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> For example, if a script is named with the path ''path/to/script'', and it starts with the following line, <code>#!/bin/sh</code>, then the program loader is instructed to run the program ''/bin/sh'', passing ''path/to/script'' as the first argument.\nIn [[Linux]], this behavior is the result of both kernel and user-space code.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Corbet |first1=Jonathan |title=The case of the supersized shebang |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/779997/ |website=LWN.net}}</ref>\n\nThe shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter, because the \"#\" character is a [[Comment (computer programming)|comment]] marker in many scripting languages; some language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to begin comments still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of its purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/|title=SRFI 22}}</ref>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe form of a shebang [[interpreter directive]] is as follows:<ref name=\"linux\" />\n #!''interpreter'' [''optional-arg'']\nin which ''interpreter'' is an [[absolute path]] to an executable program.\n\nThe optional argument is a string representing a single argument. White space after <b style=font-family:monospace;font-size:120%>#!</b> is optional.\n\nIn Linux, the file specified by ''interpreter'' can be executed if it has the execute right and contains code which the kernel can execute directly, if it has a wrapper defined for it via ''sysctl'' (such as for executing Microsoft .EXE binaries using [[wine (software)|wine]]), or if it contains a shebang. On Linux and Minix, an interpreter can also be a script. A chain of shebangs and wrappers yields a directly executable file that gets the encountered scripts as parameters in reverse order. For example, if file ''/bin/A'' is an executable file in ELF format, file ''/bin/B'' contains the shebang ''#!/bin/A optparam'', and file ''/bin/C'' contains the shebang ''#!/bin/B'', then executing file ''/bin/C'' resolves to ''/bin/B /bin/C'', which finally resolves to ''/bin/A optparam /bin/B /bin/C''.\n\nIn [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based operating systems such as [[macOS]], and in [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]],<ref>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45444823/python3-shebang-line-not-working-as-expected</ref> the file specified by ''interpreter'' must be an executable binary, and cannot itself be a script.\n\n==Examples==\nSome typical shebang lines:\n* <code>#!/bin/sh</code> \u2013 Execute the file using the [[Bourne shell]], or a compatible shell, assumed to be in the /bin directory\n* <code>#!/bin/bash</code> \u2013 Execute the file using the [[Bash shell]] (but it is recommended to use <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> instead, since posix doesn't require bash to be placed under <code>/bin/</code>; see section ''Portability'')\n* <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> \u2013 Execute with a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interpreter, using the program search path to find it\n* <code>#!/bin/false</code> \u2013 Do nothing, but return a non-zero [[exit status]], indicating failure. Used to prevent stand-alone execution of a script file intended for execution in a specific context, such as by the <code>'''.'''</code> command from sh/bash, <code>source</code> from csh/tcsh, or as a .profile, .cshrc, or .login file.\n\nShebang lines may include specific options that are passed to the interpreter. However, implementations vary in the parsing behavior of options; for portability, only one option should be specified without any embedded whitespace. Further portability guidelines are found below.\n\n==Purpose==\nInterpreter directives allow scripts and data files to be used as commands, hiding the details of their implementation from users and other programs, by removing the need to prefix scripts with their interpreter on the command line.\n\nA [[Bourne shell]] script that is identified by the path ''some/path/to/foo'', has the initial line,\n #!/bin/sh -x\nand is executed with parameters ''bar'' and ''baz'' as\n some/path/to/foo bar baz\nprovides a similar result as having actually executed the following command line instead:\n /bin/sh -x some/path/to/foo bar baz\nIf ''/bin/sh'' specifies the [[Bourne shell]], then the end result is that all of the shell commands in the file ''some/path/to/foo'' are executed with the positional variables ''$1'' and ''$2'' having the values ''bar'' and ''baz'', respectively. Also, because the initial [[number sign]] is the character used to introduce comments in the [[Bourne shell]] language (and in the languages understood by many other interpreters), the whole shebang line is ignored by the interpreter.\n\nHowever, it is up to the interpreter to ignore the shebang line; thus, a script consisting of the following two lines simply echos ''both'' lines to [[standard output]] when run:\n #!/bin/cat\n Hello world!\n\n===Strengths===\nWhen compared to the use of global association lists between file extensions and the interpreting applications, the interpreter directive method allows users to use interpreters not known at a global system level, and without administrator rights. It also allows specific selection of interpreter, without overloading the [[filename extension]] [[namespace]] (where one file extension refers to more than one file type), and allows the implementation language of a script to be changed without changing its invocation syntax by other programs. Invokers of the script need not know what the implementation language is as the script itself is responsible for specifying the interpreter to use.\n\n==Portability==\n\n=== Program location ===\nShebangs must specify [[absolute path]]s (or paths relative to current working directory) to system executables; this can cause problems on systems that have a non-standard file system layout. Even when systems have fairly standard paths, it is quite possible for variants of the same operating system to have different locations for the desired interpreter. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], for example, might be in ''/usr/bin/python'', ''/usr/local/bin/python'', or even something like ''/home/username/bin/python'' if installed by an ordinary user.\n\nA similar problem exists for the [[POSIX shell]], since POSIX only required its name to be ''sh'', but did not mandate a path. A common value is {{tt|/bin/sh}}, but some systems such as Solaris have the POSIX-compatible shell at ''/usr/xpg4/bin/sh''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html#tag_20_117_16|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7|year=2008|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> In many [[Linux]] systems and recent releases of [[Mac OS X]], ''/bin/sh'' is a hard or [[symbolic link]] to ''/bin/bash'', the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bourne Again shell]] (BASH). Using bash-specific syntax while maintaining a shebang pointing to ''sh'' is also not portable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/shell_script_mistakes.html|title=pixelbeat.org: Common shell script mistakes|quote=It's much better to test scripts directly in a POSIX compliant shell if possible. The `bash --posix` option doesn't suffice as it still accepts some 'bashisms'}}</ref>\n\nBecause of this it is sometimes required to edit the shebang line after copying a [[script (computer programming)|script]] from one computer to another because the path that was coded into the script may not apply on a new machine, depending on the consistency in past convention of placement of the interpreter. For this reason and because [[POSIX]] does not standardize path names, POSIX does not standardize the feature.\n\nOften, the program {{tt|[[env|/usr/bin/env]]}} can be used to circumvent this limitation by introducing a level of [[indirection]]. {{code|#!}} is followed by {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}, followed by the desired command without full path, as in this example:\n #!/usr/bin/env sh\n\nThis mostly works because the path {{tt|/usr/bin/env}} is commonly used for the {{tt|env}} utility,\nand it invokes the first {{tt|sh}} found in the user's [[PATH (variable)|$PATH]], typically {{tt|/bin/sh}}.\n\nOn a system with setuid script support this will reintroduce the race eliminated by the {{tt|/dev/fd}} workaround described below. There are still some portability issues with [[OpenServer]] 5.0.6 and [[Unicos]] 9.0.2 which have only {{tt|/bin/env}} and no {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}.\n\n=== Character interpretation ===\nAnother portability problem is the interpretation of the command arguments.\nSome systems, including Linux, do not split up the arguments;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2008/11/09/msg002388.html |title=/usr/bin/env behaviour |publisher=Mail-index.netbsd.org |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> for example, when running the script with the first line like,\n #!/usr/bin/env python -c\nThat is, {{code|python -c}} will be passed as one argument to {{tt|/usr/bin/env}}, rather than two arguments. [[Cygwin]] also behaves this way.\n\nComplex interpreter invocations are possible through the use of an additional [[Wrapper function|wrapper]]. FreeBSD 6.0 (2005) introduced a {{tt|-S}} option to its {{tt|env}} as it changed the shebang-reading behavior to non-splitting. This option tells {{tt|env}} to split the string itself.<ref>{{man|1|env|FreeBSD}}</ref> The GNU {{tt|env}} utility since coreutil 8.30 (2018) also includes this feature.<ref>{{cite web |title=env invocation |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.htmll#g_t_002dS_002f_002d_002dsplit_002dstring-usage-in-scripts |website=GNU Coreutils |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> Although using this option mitigates the portability issue on the kernel end with splitting, it adds the requirement that {{tt|env}} supports this particular extension.\n\nAnother problem is scripts containing a [[carriage return]] character immediately after the shebang, perhaps as a result of being edited on a system that uses DOS [[newline|line break]]s, such as [[Microsoft Windows]]. Some systems interpret the carriage return character as part of the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] command, resulting in an error message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://askubuntu.com/questions/372672/what-could-cause-a-script-to-fail-to-find-python-when-it-has-usr-bin-env-pyt/372691#372691 |title=Carriage Return causes bash to fail| date=2013-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Magic number===\nThe shebang is actually a human-readable instance of a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]] in the executable file, the magic byte string being ''{{mono|0x23 0x21}}'', the two-character encoding in [[ASCII]] of {{mono|#!}}. This magic number is detected by the \"[[exec (operating system)|exec]]\" family of functions, which determine whether a file is a script or an executable binary. The presence of the shebang will result in the execution of the specified executable, usually an interpreter for the script's language. It has been claimed that some old versions of Unix expect the normal shebang to be followed by a space and a slash (''{{code|#! /}}''), but this appears to be untrue;{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} rather, blanks after the shebang have traditionally been allowed, and sometimes documented with a space (see the 1980 email in [[#History|history]] section below).\n\nThe shebang characters are represented by the same two bytes in [[extended ASCII]] encodings, including [[UTF-8]], which is commonly used for scripts and other text files on current Unix-like systems. However, UTF-8 files may begin with the optional [[byte order mark]] (BOM); if the \"exec\" function specifically detects the bytes 0x23 and 0x21, then the presence of the BOM ({{mono|0xEF 0xBB 0xBF}}) before the shebang will prevent the script interpreter from being executed. Some authorities recommend against using the byte order mark in [[POSIX]] (Unix-like) scripts,<ref>{{cite web|title = FAQ - UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM: Can a UTF-8 data stream contain the BOM character (in UTF-8 form)? If yes, then can I still assume the remaining UTF-8 bytes are in big-endian order?|url = http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom5|accessdate = 2009-01-04}}</ref> for this reason and for wider interoperability and philosophical concerns. Additionally, a byte order mark is not necessary in UTF-8, as that encoding does not have [[endianness]] issues; it serves only to identify the encoding as UTF-8.\n\n==Etymology==\nAn executable file starting with an interpreter directive is simply called a script, often prefaced with the name or general classification of the intended interpreter. The name ''shebang'' for the distinctive two characters may have come from an inexact [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of ''[[sharp (music)|SHArp]] [[Exclamation Mark|bang]]'' or ''haSH bang'', referring to the two typical Unix names for them. Another theory on the ''sh'' in ''shebang'' is that it is from the default shell ''sh'', usually invoked with shebang.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/shebang.html |title=Jargon File entry for shebang |website=Catb.org |accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref> This usage was current by December 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.sources.bugs/msg/96bbbe2b019464c5?dmode=source&output=gplain&noredirect|title=Perl didn't grok setuid scripts that had a space on the first line between the shebang and the interpreter name|publisher=[[USENET]]|last=Wall|first=Larry|author-link=Larry Wall}}</ref> and probably earlier.\n\n==History==\nThe shebang was introduced by [[Dennis Ritchie]] between [[Version 7 Unix|Edition 7]] and [[Version 8 Unix|8]] at Bell Laboratories.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the view of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook is unobstructed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and contained Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]], a historic farmstead in Fort Valley built in 1834 was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>  Daniel Munch was a successful farmer and distiller, the son on early German settlers who moved to Fort Valley in 1779.

Total membership was around 1,400, with 43 branches founded mostly in non Malay urban areas.Dr. Lim Chong Eu in Penang and Dr. Tan Chee Khoon in Kuala Lumpur were the two vital axes around which the party built its national outlook.\n\nThe party won the state of Penang in the [[Malaysian general election, 1969|1969 general election]] by taking 16 out of 24 seats, winning control from the MCA. Lim Chong Eu became Penang's Chief Minister.  Gerakan and the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]], which won in Kelantan, were the only parties not then affiliated with the Alliance Party to form a state government in Malaysia.  However, due to internal disputes within the party, for example over plan for closer ties with Alliance, the party was split. Many of its members, such as Syed Hussein Alatas, [[V.

It was released in November 1973 on [[MCA Records]] and was produced by [[Walter Haynes]]. It was Seely's first solo studio album in three years and was her first to be issue with the MCA label. The album produced a total of six singles that were originally released between 1970 and 1973. The record is named for its two major hits: \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\". It would be Seely's final album for the MCA label.  \n\n==Background and content==\n''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'' was produced in several sessions between June 1970 and September 1973. All sessions were recorded by [[Walter Haynes]] at Bradley's Barn, a studio located in [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee]]. It was Seely's third studio album recorded with Haynes, and second to be recorded with him as a solo artist.<ref name=\"Liner Notes\">{{cite journal |last1=Seely |first1=Jeannie |title=''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'' (Liner Notes and Album Information) |journal=[[MCA Records]] |date=November 1973}}</ref> The project consisted of 11 tracks. Four of the album's tracks were written by Seely's then-husband and songwriter, [[Hank Cochran]]. Among the songs Cochran composed was both of the album's title tracks: \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"Lucky Ladies\". The record also included a song self-penned by Seely entitled \"Farm in Pennsyltucky\".<ref name=\"Discogs\">{{cite web |title=Jeannie Seely -- ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'' (1973, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Jeannie-Seely-Can-I-Sleep-In-Your-Arms-Lucky-Ladies/release/12609678 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref> In addition, the album contained cover versions of songs previously recorded by other artists. The eighth track, \"All Right (I'll Sign the Papers)\", was first written and recorded by [[Mel Tillis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mel Tillis - \"All Right (I'll Sign the Papers)\" (Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Mel-Tillis-All-Right-Ill-Sign-The-Papers-Helpess-Hopeless-Fool/release/8420886 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'' was Seely's first studio album to be issued under the MCA record label. Her previous sessions and albums were recorded for [[Decca Records]], however, the label re-titled its name to MCA in 1973. It would also be Seely's solo studio album in three years.<ref name=\"Liner Notes\"/>\n\n==Release and reception==\nBefore the release of ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', five solo singles had been released by Seely on both Decca and MCA Records. Four of these singles only reached minor positions on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart, which may have accounted for the lack of an official album release.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> The first single released in anticipation of the studio album was \"Tell Me Again\" in October 1970.
