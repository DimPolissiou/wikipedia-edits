He is a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJoe grew up in [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, New York]], a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative Lawrence Clay-Bey.  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074408/http://babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=2016-02-06 }}</ref> In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/466/boxer-baby-joe-mesi-visits-golisano-childrens-hospital.aspx</ref>\n\n=== Injury and suspension ===\nMesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two [[subdural hematoma]]s <ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3299563.html</ref>\n\nThe injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion [[Vassiliy Jirov]]. In round 9,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325185242/http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}</ref><ref>http://wn.com/Vassily_Jirov</ref> Mesi was knocked down from a right hook and in the tenth round he was knocked down two more times. Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges (i.e., won by [[unanimous decision]]),\n\nIn June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \"in no more danger than any other boxer.\"  Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote.  In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], opinion that -  \"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\" - Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \"You play football, you don't play boxing.\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/sports/othersports/suspension-upheld-but-boxer-is-fighting-it.html | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension Upheld But Boxer Is Fighting It | date=15 July 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe suspension effectively [[blacklist]]ed him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the [[full faith and credit clause]]. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had 'leaked' news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005.  However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials.  Mesi has since been licensed by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Boxing Commission in February 2006, the [[Louisiana]] State Boxing Commission in June 2006, the [[Arkansas]] State Boxing Commission in August 2006, the [[Michigan]] State Boxing Commission in September 2006, the [[West Virginia]] State Boxing Commission in February 2007, and the [[Rhode Island]] State Boxing Commission in October 2007.\n\nJoe Mesi has one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight.

retired [[Boxing|boxer]] and politician from [[Tonawanda, New York]]. He is a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJoe grew up in [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, New York]], a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative Lawrence Clay-Bey.  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries.

He befriends a five-year-old girl named May Chalotte and her brothers January (\"Jan\"), February (\"Feb\") and twins March and April. The children's parents died in a riverboat accident six months before, but Jan has not told anybody but Feb, and now Johnny, fearing they would be sent to an orphanage. Johnny makes it clear that he is adamantly opposed to taking on any responsibilities, but somehow finds himself becoming their \"uncle\" anyway. He works on a farm during the week and sings and waits tables on Sunday in a restaurant owned by Jericho Schlosser to provide for the children.\n\nWhen Prudence Millett, daughter of the local judge, comes to inquire why the boys are not in school, Johnny is forced to claim he is their uncle. A romance begins to blossom, despite his determination to remain free of entanglements.\n\nWhen wealthy, unloved Jeffrey Gilland Sr. orders Johnny to keep his disreputable children away from his son Jeffrey Jr., Johnny scuffles with him and gets arrested. He is bailed out by Prudence, but his troubles are not over. Plato Cassin, Gilland's lawyer, finds out about the children's parents and blackmails Johnny into agreeing to marry one of his older, spinster sisters, Genevieve and Adelaide, in order to keep the kids. (Adelaide wins a game of [[quoits]] for the privilege.) Plato also convinces Prudence that Johnny was using the children to romance her.\n\nAfter thinking it over, Johnny decides to run away with the now-released Professor Ford. May overhears and invites people to her birthday party the next day, intending it to be a going-away party for Johnny. Meanwhile, Johnny dissuades Gilland's young son from running away himself. At the party, a grateful Gilland drops the charges against him. \n\nPrudence shows up, having seen how far Johnny is willing to go for the children. When May says she would rather have her for an aunt, Prudence agrees wholeheartedly. Johnny tells Adelaide that he loves Prudence. She proves to be a sport and the two women gamble for him. Professor Ford offers what he and Johnny believe is Johnny's two-headed coin. Prudence wins the toss. Later, Johnny is shocked to learn that they accidentally used a regular coin.  \n\nProfessor Ford leaves town, leaving Johnny with his new family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Holden]] as Johnny Rutledge\n* [[Coleen Gray]] as Prudence Millett\n* Mary Jane Saunders as May Chalotte\n* [[Charles Winninger]] as Professor Mordecai Ford\n* [[Stuart Erwin]] as Constable Pudge Barnham\n* [[Clinton Sundberg]] as Plato Cassin\n* [[Gary Gray (actor)|Gary Gray]] as Jan Chalotte\n* [[Sig Ruman]] as Jericho Schlosser\n* [[Billy Gray (actor)|Billy Gray]] as Feb Chalotte\n* [[Lloyd Corrigan]] as Judge Millett\n* Frederic Tozere as Jeffrey Gilland Sr.\n* Peggy Converse as Genevieve Cassin\n* Lillian Bronson as Adelaide Cassin\n\n==Songs==\nJohnny sings a number of songs in the film, including performing in [[blackface]] in the opening scene.
