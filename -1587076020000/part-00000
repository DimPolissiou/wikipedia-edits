Nemo, despite being hampered by a lame fin, is eager to explore life around the ocean. Marlin, however, is overprotective of him, having lost his wife Coral and all their other eggs in a barracuda attack, leaving Nemo as his only child. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin unintentionally embarrasses him, and while Marlin is distracted with the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo defiantly sneaks away from the reef toward a speedboat, where he is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin tries to chase the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from acute short term memory loss, who accompanies him. During an encounter with three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating other fish, Marlin notices a diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo. Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed, which sends one of the sharks into a feeding frenzy, and Marlin and Dory narrowly escape, but are knocked unconscious when the sharks accidentally set off an old mine.\n\nMeanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia, where he meets the Tank Gang, including yellow tang Bubbles, sea star Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and damselfish Deb, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's young niece, Darla, whose rough treatment has killed most of her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing the dentist to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank is cleaned, giving them the opportunity to roll out the window and into the harbour. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed, leaving Gill guilt-ridden.\n\nMarlin and Dory wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep sea trench. Swimming after it, Marlin is chased by an anglerfish, while Dory reads the address and recites it repeatedly to commit it to memory. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards their instructions to take what he believes is a safer route, leading them into a forest of jellyfish where they end up unconscious from all the jellyfish stings. Marlin and Dory wake up to find themselves on the East Australian Current with a group of friendly sea turtles including Crush and his son Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, impressing them, and news spreads across the ocean, all the way to the dentist's office, where a pelican named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds, and soon the aquarium's contents are covered in green algae.\n\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a blue whale. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel, who help the pair escape from a group of seagulls and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter, the AquaScum 2003, foiling the Tank Gang's escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist prepares to give Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel causes a disturbance, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain that leads to the ocean.\n\nThinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory and begins his journey home. Marlin's departure causes Dory to lose her memory. She meets Nemo as he reaches the ocean, but does not remember him. However, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught by a fishing boat with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the boat's net so they can escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr. Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip. At the dentist\u2019s, the Aquascum 2003 has broken, and the gang, having been put in bag, roll out of the window and into the sea. Still stuck in bags, they ponder what happens next.\n\n==Voice cast{{anchor|Cast}}==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}<!-- All species need to be sourced -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Marlin, a [[clownfish]] and Nemo's father.\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[regal blue tang]] with short-term memory loss.\n* [[Alexander Gould]] as Nemo, Marlin's only surviving son, who is excited about life and exploring the ocean, but gets captured and domesticated as a pet.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Gill, a [[moorish idol]] fish living in an aquarium in a dentist clinic, and the leader of the Tank Gang.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bloat, the aquarium's [[porcupinefish]].\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Peach, the aquarium's [[starfish]].\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Bubbles, the aquarium's [[yellow tang]] fish.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Gurgle, the aquarium's [[royal gramma]] fish.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Deb/Flo, the aquarium's [[Dascyllus melanurus|striped damselfish]].\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Jacques, the aquarium's [[cleaner shrimp]].\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Nigel, an [[Australian pelican]], who often visits the dentist clinic and is friends with the aquarium fish.\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] as Crush, a [[green sea turtle]].\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Coral, Marlin's wife and Nemo's mother.\n* [[Nicholas Bird]] as Squirt, Crush's son.\n* [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] as Mr. Ray, a [[spotted eagle ray]] and Nemo's schoolteacher.\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bruce, a vegetarian [[great white shark]], who fights his instinctive wills to eat innocent fish and is friends with Anchor and Chum.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Anchor, a [[hammerhead shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Chum.\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Chum, a [[mako shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Anchor.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as The Dentist.\n* LuLu Ebeling as Darla, the dentist's rambunctious young niece.\n* Jordy Ranft as Tad, a [[butterfly fish]] fingerling and Nemo's school friend.\n* Erica Beck as Pearl, a young [[flapjack octopus]] and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Sheldon, a young [[seahorse]], and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as the school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]].\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name=\"commentary\">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[National Geographic|''National Geographic'' magazine]], Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:\n\n{{quote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish\u2014it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>\n}}\n\nIn addition, clownfish are colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called \"very unusual for an animated film\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nStanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died, but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nThe casting of [[Albert Brooks]], in Stanton's opinion, \"saved\" the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\n\nThe idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nStanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]\" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice.

Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.\n\n''Finding Nemo'' was released on May 30, 2003, to positive reviews with praise to its animation, story, characters, and voice acting. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Additionally, it became the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]] at the time of its release, and was the [[2003 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2003]], earning a total of $871&nbsp;million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run.<ref name=BOinitial>{{cite web |title=Finding Nemo (2003) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=findingnemo.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831031932/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=findingnemo.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Finding Nemo'' is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold {{as of|2006|lc=y}},<ref>Boone, Louis E.''Contemporary Business 2006'', Thomson South-Western, page 4&nbsp;\u2013 {{ISBN|0-324-32089-2}}</ref> and was the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G-rated]] film of all time before Pixar's own ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' overtook it.

Nemo, despite being hampered by a lame fin, is eager to explore life around the ocean. Marlin, however, is overprotective of him, having lost his wife Coral and all their other eggs in a barracuda attack, leaving Nemo as his only child. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin unintentionally embarrasses him, and while Marlin is distracted with the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo defiantly sneaks away from the reef toward a speedboat, where he is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin tries to chase the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from acute short term memory loss, who accompanies him. During an encounter with three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating other fish, Marlin notices a diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo. Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed, which sends one of the sharks into a feeding frenzy, and Marlin and Dory narrowly escape, but are knocked unconscious when the sharks accidentally set off an old mine.\n\nMeanwhile, Nemo is placed in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia, where he meets the Tank Gang, including yellow tang Bubbles, sea star Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and damselfish Deb, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's young niece, Darla, whose rough treatment has killed most of her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing the dentist to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank is cleaned, giving them the opportunity to roll out the window and into the harbour. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed, leaving Gill guilt-ridden.\n\nMarlin and Dory wake up unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep sea trench. Swimming after it, Marlin is chased by an anglerfish, while Dory reads the address and recites it repeatedly to commit it to memory. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards their instructions to take what he believes is a safer route, leading them into a forest of jellyfish where they end up unconscious from all the jellyfish stings. Marlin and Dory wake up to find themselves on the East Australian Current with a group of friendly sea turtles including Crush and his son Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, impressing them, and news spreads across the ocean, all the way to the dentist's office, where a pelican named Nigel tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds, and soon the aquarium's contents are covered in green algae.\n\nMarlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a blue whale. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel, who help the pair escape from a group of seagulls and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter, the AquaScum 2003, foiling the Tank Gang's escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist prepares to give Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel causes a disturbance, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape through a drain that leads to the ocean.\n\nThinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory and begins his journey home. Marlin's departure causes Dory to lose her memory. She meets Nemo as he reaches the ocean, but does not remember him. However, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word \"Sydney\" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught by a fishing boat with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the boat's net so they can escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr. Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip. At the dentist\u2019s, the Aquascum 2003 has broken, and the gang, having been put in bag, roll out of the window and into the sea. Still stuck in bags, they ponder what happens next.\n\n==Voice cast{{anchor|Cast}}==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}<!-- All species need to be sourced -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Marlin, a [[clownfish]] and Nemo's father.\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Dory, a [[regal blue tang]] with short-term memory loss.\n* [[Alexander Gould]] as Nemo, Marlin's only surviving son, who is excited about life and exploring the ocean, but gets captured and domesticated as a pet.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Gill, a [[moorish idol]] fish living in an aquarium in a dentist clinic, and the leader of the Tank Gang.\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bloat, the aquarium's [[porcupinefish]].\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Peach, the aquarium's [[starfish]].\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Bubbles, the aquarium's [[yellow tang]] fish.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Gurgle, the aquarium's [[royal gramma]] fish.\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Deb/Flo, the aquarium's [[Dascyllus melanurus|striped damselfish]].\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Jacques, the aquarium's [[cleaner shrimp]].\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Nigel, an [[Australian pelican]], who often visits the dentist clinic and is friends with the aquarium fish.\n* [[Andrew Stanton]] as Crush, a [[green sea turtle]].\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Coral, Marlin's wife and Nemo's mother.\n* [[Nicholas Bird]] as Squirt, Crush's son.\n* [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] as Mr. Ray, a [[spotted eagle ray]] and Nemo's schoolteacher.\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Bruce, a vegetarian [[great white shark]], who fights his instinctive wills to eat innocent fish and is friends with Anchor and Chum.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Anchor, a [[hammerhead shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Chum.\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Chum, a [[mako shark]] who is friends with Bruce and Anchor.\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as The Dentist.\n* LuLu Ebeling as Darla, the dentist's rambunctious young niece.\n* Jordy Ranft as Tad, a [[butterfly fish]] fingerling and Nemo's school friend.\n* Erica Beck as Pearl, a young [[flapjack octopus]] and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Sheldon, a young [[seahorse]], and Nemo's school friend.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as the school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]].\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe inspiration for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director [[Andrew Stanton]]'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.<ref name=\"commentary\">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.<ref>The Pixar Story by Leslie Iwerks, 2007 documentary</ref> Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[National Geographic|''National Geographic'' magazine]], Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an [[Sea anemone|anemone]]:\n\n{{quote|It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish\u2014it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/01/clownfish-anemone-symbiotic-relationship/ Beautiful Friendship] ''National Geographic'' magazine, January 2010</ref>\n}}\n\nIn addition, clownfish are colourful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. As a result, ''Finding Nemo'' began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director [[Lee Unkrich]] called \"very unusual for an animated film\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The artists took [[scuba diving]] lessons to study the coral reef.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nStanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died, but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrew Stanton cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Stanton]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nThe casting of [[Albert Brooks]], in Stanton's opinion, \"saved\" the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\n\nThe idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and [[Bob Peterson (animator)|Bob Peterson]] while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast [[Ellen DeGeneres]] when he watched an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]] and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nStanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's [[Storyboard|story reel]], and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director [[Brad Bird]]. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation's [[Thumper (Disney)|Thumper]]\" and immediately cast Nicholas.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n[[Megan Mullally]] was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]] on the television show ''[[Will & Grace]]'' was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/megan%20mullally%20dropped%20from%20finding%20nemo|title=Megan Mullally&nbsp;\u2013 Megan Mullally Dropped From Finding Nemo|publisher=WENN|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography.

The hypothesis that the necrotic tissue of cacti serves as a similarly protective environment as the soil of the Sonoran Desert for other species of ''Drosophila'' has been disproven.

The Sonoran Desert incorporates the [[peninsular]] region of [[Baja California]] and mainland regions of California. After the peninsula was formed, the [[Gulf of California]], which lies between  the peninsula and the mainland, served as a barrier to dispersal opportunities in insects and land mammals. Another physical geographic barrier is the [[Gran Desierto de Altar|Gran Desierto de Alter]], a large sand dune between the peninsula and the mainland.\u00a0 These physical geographic barriers are the cause of [[gene flow]] among Sonoran Desert flies. Studies of [[Alloenzyme|allozymes]] in ''D. mettleri'' and ''D. nigrospiracula'' show differences in nuclear markers that would otherwise suggest differentiation among the regions of the Sonoran Desert. In ''D. nigrospiracula'', there were markers that showed differences within the species when they were located disparately among the peninsular and mainland regions of the desert. In ''D. mettleri'', however, there were no such nuclear marker differences among members of the species found on the peninsula versus those found on the mainland. These differences show that deviations among ''D. mettleri'' can be supported through the [[Gene flow|stepping stone hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfeiler E, Markow TA | title = Phylogeography of the Cactophilic Drosophila and Other Arthropods Associated with Cactus Necroses in the Sonoran Desert | journal = Insects | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 218\u201331 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 26467624 | pmc = 4553460 | doi = 10.3390/insects2020218 }}</ref>     \n\nEach of the relatives of ''D. mettleri'' that are closest [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] do not inhabit the Sonoran Desert region; therefore, the four species of ''Drosophila'' that do inhabit the Sonoran Desert region experienced [[parallel evolution]] instead of speciation within the desert.

Each of these flies chooses to exploit a different host plant for its resources (breeding, food). The selection of host cactus is important to the amount of resources available to each of these species and plays a role in the growth and development of the species. \u00a0\n\n=== Other factors leading to host selection ===\nEach fly species exploits necrotic rot patches on the cactus for nutrients. The largest necrotic patch sizes rank in order from highest to lowest: cardon, saguaro, [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], and senita. The size and arm spans of the cacti did not influence the size of the necrotic patches. Instead of rot patch size being regulated by spatial factors, seasonal differences in the growth of the host plants determined how large and how abundant necrotic patches were. Further, temporal factors determined the amount of time a necrotic patch lasted; during the spring, patches are least abundant and during the summer, patches are most abundant. While all other species of the four Sonoran Desert Drosophila showed a correlation between the resource richness of their hosts\u2019 necrotic patches and population size, no such distinct correlation was found for ''D. mettleri''. ''D. mettleri'' exploits both necrotic patches and soil near rotting cacti; further, this species can thrive on a variety of hosts, leading to more dispersal of these flies under a given spatial region. The overall development periods and availability of host cacti strongly affects the growth of both larvae and the reproductive success of adults. For larvae, optimal host conditions entail long-lived necrotic plots as this gives the larvae enough time to grow and develop into larger, more fit adults. For adults, adequate conditions include hosts that grow more regularly because adults will have a regular site to lay eggs.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" />\n\n===Defense mechanism===\nThe host cacti contain toxic chemicals and compounds that otherwise prevent flies from feeding on cacti. ''D. metlerri'' contains genes that enable it to detoxify these toxic compounds and thus feed off of the cacti as a source of nutrients. These genes are linked to the evolution of [[xenobiotic]] resistance.\n\n==Life history==\nThe unique ability of ''D. mettleri'' to detoxify the high concentration of [[Alkaloid|alkaloids]] present in the soil surrounding cacti with rot spots enables adult females to lay their eggs and sustain their larvae in the same nesting area. Other species of desert ''Drosophila'' that inhabit the same geographic region lack this ability and thus reduce the amount of competition females face in finding nesting sites. One species (''D. majavensis'') is composed of adults who cannot withstand the high alkaloid concentration in cacti soil unlike the larva that is only slightly sensitive. While this may encourage larval deposits to form in the soil, the inability of adult females to survive in these soil conditions prevents them from nesting in the soil, thus decreasing the amount of competition ''D. mettleri'' faces in finding appropriate nesting sites.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biennial Report, National Institute of General Medical Sciences (U.S.)|date=1987|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health}}</ref>\n\n==Food resources==\n\n=== Rot material ===\nLike other desert species of ''Drosophila'', ''D. mettleri'' relies on the exudant juices of cacti as a feeding substrate.

''D. mettleri'', belonging to this complex, begin courting as soon as they have their first [[Intrasexual competition|intrasexual]] contact. Once the male brushes against a female, courting begins and the male begins to follow the female. The male initiates in courtship song through vibration of his wings. The male will choose to either follow a side of the female or follow behind her. Depending on the spot the male decides to occupy will determine the vibrational frequency of the male's wings. The farther the male is to the female, the shorter the wing pulses are. When the female stops moving, vibrational frequency increases. During this courtship song, the male may choose to lick the genitals of the female. If the female chooses to accept a male during his courting song, the female's wings will expand and the male will terminate his song. The flies will begin to copulate soon after.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Spangler HG, Heed WB|date=January 1995|title=Courtship sounds and behaviour of the two saguaro-breeding Drosophila and their relatives.|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1031\u20139|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80103-0}}</ref> In comparison to other species in the Eremophila complex, males of ''D. mettleri'' are more likely to force copulation with females.\n\n===Courtship song===\nThe courting song of ''D. mettleri'' is characterized by distinct vibrational pulses and frequencies. The more mobile a female is, the more irregular the vibrational pulses of the male will be. To initiate the courting song, a male will extend his wings seventy-eighty degrees and release a few short pulses. After the initiation process, more regular pulses are released by males.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\" />\n\n=== Male-female controls ===\nIn ''D. mettleri'', after the male inserts his sperm (i.e. ejaculates) into his mate, swelling of the vaginal wall occurs. This may serve as a copulatory plug that serves as a defense against other males copulating and having offspring with the female. The male is then enabled to ensure his own paternity. This is an adaptation by the males of ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0as females of this species re-mate many times and will selectively fertilize her eggs. The copulatory plug has been shown to ensure paternity of the father, but there is no evidence of this plug serving any selection purposes. \u00a0\n\n6-8 hours after the insemination process occurs, a female will get rid of any excess sperm and the material that was used as a copulatory plug by her mate. This shows that both the male and females in the relationship have control over the sexual behaviors and outcomes of the opposite sex.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Tolbert LP, Heed WB|date=March 1994|title=Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=275|issue=3|pages=467\u201379|doi=10.1007/BF00318816|pmid=8137397}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:Parasite140083-fig1 Figs 1-7 Neoechinorhynchus (Hebesoma) spiramuscularis.tif|left|thumb|A sketch shows the reproductive architecture in a female fly.]]\n<br />\n==== Ejaculation material ====\nThe ejaculate material from the male serves a larger purpose than acting as a copulatory plug. The fluid may serve as a source of nutrients, and can also affect the time it takes for sperm activation to occur as well as the time of oviposition. The nutrients found in this fluid have been shown to increase egg size and to increase the quantity of eggs laid by the female (depending on the nutrient density of the fluid). Thus, the quality of this fluid limits or increases the female's reproductive success. The amount of fluid a male will contribute during a mating is dependent on the species of the Sonoran Desert drosophila. In ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0males make large ejaculatory investments when mating, and thus the male's fluid quality plays a large role in the development of the larvae.\n\n=== Ejaculation nutrients' role in monogamy ===\nThe costs of having only one reproductive partner due to effects of the plug must be outweighed by the nutrient benefits gained by the ejaculated material. The cost to benefit trade-off is dependent upon resource availability and is highly regulated by the distribution and growth of rot material.  In D. ''mettleri'', there has been an evolutionary drive toward greater reproductive success of males donating the best quality and quantity of fluid. Radio-labeling was used to measure the amount of fluid incorporated into female egg production (and thus not removed from the body after 6-8 hours). They found that females with the largest vaginal swellings incorporated the highest amount of sperm from a single male partner than did females who had smaller vaginal swellings (and thus had the option to re-mate). Other Dipterans who do not have females undergoing an insemination process were also observed; no radio-labeled material was found in the eggs of these females, showing that the insemination process characteristic of D. ''mettleri'' and other Desert Drosophila is essential in male paternity assurance.<ref name=\"pmid28568832\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pitnick S, Markow TA, Riedy MF|date=May 1991|title=Transfer of Ejaculate and Incorporation of Male-Derived Substances by Females in the Nannoptera Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=45|issue=3|pages=774\u2013780|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04347.x|pmid=28568832}}</ref>\n\n=== Not all are monogamous ===\nA study published in 2012 did extensive research into the reproductive biology of ''D. mettleri'' and correlating information to its reproductive behaviors. Male flies mature more quickly than female flies do, but the study showed this is not the pivotal factor in why many wild females either lack sperm or exploit sperm sources too quickly once inseminated. The researchers concluded that the quick cycling of sperm in females explains why there may be frequent remating in this species both in the lab and in nature. The study also found that there were no consequences to life spans of females that had remated more than other females. In fact, a few benefits to multiple mating for females include greater female postcopulatory control of sperm and greater success of offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese A.|last2=Beall|first2=Stephen|last3=Castrezana|first3=Sergio|date=2012-04-01|title=The wild side of life|journal=Fly|volume=6|issue=2|pages=98\u2013101|doi=10.4161/fly.19552|issn=1933-6934|pmid=22627903|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Parental care==\n===Oviposition===\nAs [[Necrotroph|necrotrophs]], these flies are known to lay their eggs in the rotting refuse of dying cacti.

The significance of this behavior is that the arid conditions of the desert lead to extreme water loss in the cacti, and resulting liquid toxins trailing into nearby soil is concentrated to a magnitude other nectrotrophs cannot detoxify.

The Sonoran Desert incorporates the [[peninsular]] region of [[Baja California]] and mainland regions of California. After the peninsula was formed, the [[Gulf of California]], which lies between  the peninsula and the mainland, served as a barrier to dispersal opportunities in insects and land mammals.

In ''D. nigrospiracula'', there were markers that showed differences within the species when they were located disparately among the peninsular and mainland regions of the desert. In ''D. mettleri'', however, there were no such nuclear marker differences among members of the species found on the peninsula versus those found on the mainland. These differences show that deviations among ''D. mettleri'' can be supported through the [[Gene flow|stepping stone hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfeiler E, Markow TA | title = Phylogeography of the Cactophilic Drosophila and Other Arthropods Associated with Cactus Necroses in the Sonoran Desert | journal = Insects | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 218\u201331 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 26467624 | pmc = 4553460 | doi = 10.3390/insects2020218 }}</ref>     \n\nEach of the relatives of ''D. mettleri'' that are closest [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] do not inhabit the Sonoran Desert region; therefore, the four species of ''Drosophila'' that do inhabit the Sonoran Desert region experienced [[parallel evolution]] instead of speciation within the desert.

Each of these flies chooses to exploit a different host plant for its resources (breeding, food). The selection of host cactus is important to the amount of resources available to each of these species and plays a role in the growth and development of the species. \u00a0\n\n=== Other factors leading to host selection ===\nEach fly species exploits necrotic rot patches on the cactus for nutrients. The largest necrotic patch sizes rank in order from highest to lowest: cardon, saguaro, [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], and senita. The size and arm spans of the cacti did not influence the size of the necrotic patches. Instead of rot patch size being regulated by spatial factors, seasonal differences in the growth of the host plants determined how large and how abundant necrotic patches were. Further, temporal factors determined the amount of time a necrotic patch lasted; during the spring, patches are least abundant and during the summer, patches are most abundant. While all other species of the four Sonoran Desert Drosophila showed a correlation between the resource richness of their hosts\u2019 necrotic patches and population size, no such distinct correlation was found for ''D. mettleri''. ''D. mettleri'' exploits both necrotic patches and soil near rotting cacti; further, this species can thrive on a variety of hosts, leading to more dispersal of these flies under a given spatial region. The overall development periods and availability of host cacti strongly affects the growth of both larvae and the reproductive success of adults. For larvae, optimal host conditions entail long-lived necrotic plots as this gives the larvae enough time to grow and develop into larger, more fit adults. For adults, adequate conditions include hosts that grow more regularly because adults will have a regular site to lay eggs.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" />\n\n===Defense mechanism===\nThe host cacti contain toxic chemicals and compounds that otherwise prevent flies from feeding on cacti. ''D. metlerri'' contains genes that enable it to detoxify these toxic compounds and thus feed off of the cacti as a source of nutrients. These genes are linked to the evolution of [[xenobiotic]] resistance.\n\n==Life history==\nThe unique ability of ''D. mettleri'' to detoxify the high concentration of [[Alkaloid|alkaloids]] present in the soil surrounding cacti with rot spots enables adult females to lay their eggs and sustain their larvae in the same nesting area. Other species of desert ''Drosophila'' that inhabit the same geographic region lack this ability and thus reduce the amount of competition females face in finding nesting sites. One species (''D. majavensis'') is composed of adults who cannot withstand the high alkaloid concentration in cacti soil unlike the larva that is only slightly sensitive. While this may encourage larval deposits to form in the soil, the inability of adult females to survive in these soil conditions prevents them from nesting in the soil, thus decreasing the amount of competition ''D. mettleri'' faces in finding appropriate nesting sites.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biennial Report, National Institute of General Medical Sciences (U.S.)|date=1987|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health}}</ref>\n\n==Food resources==\n\n=== Rot material ===\nLike other desert species of ''Drosophila'', ''D. mettleri'' relies on the exudant juices of cacti as a feeding substrate. The juice found in the necrotic tissue of the cacti is also used as a feeding substrate when levels of exudates in the soil become low or scarce.<ref name=\"pmid10479998\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker JS, Starmer WT|date=1999|title=Environmental effects and the genetics of oviposition site preference for natural yeast substrates in Drosophila buzzatii|journal=Hereditas|volume=130|issue=2|pages=145\u201375|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1999.00145.x|pmid=10479998}}</ref>\n\n=== Yeast and bacteria ===\nThe area of the cactus often exploited by ''D. mettleri'' (when exudants are not extracted from soil) are \"rot pockets\". These pockets form when the cactus is injured; aggregates of bacteria and yeast conglomerate on the surface near the injury site and begin to form a pocket-like indent. The [[fermentation]] of the yeast and bacteria in this pocket serve as a \"signal\" to ''D. mettleri'' so that the site can be exploited for food.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" /> \n\nCommunities of yeast on host species of ''D. mettleri'' have been isolated and serve to decompose the host cacti. During mating, both sexes of the fly gift each other yeast and bacteria. This mixture is then placed on breeding sites, later exposing larvae to natural florae necessary in increasing their fitness.<ref name=\"pmid4904970\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakula M|date=November 1969|title=The persistence of a microbial flora during postembryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=365\u201374|doi=10.1016/0022-2011(69)90163-3|pmid=4904970}}</ref>\n\n==Mating==\n===Courtship behavior===\nThe courtship behaviors of desert ''Drosophila'' of the [[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] complex are similar. ''D. mettleri'', belonging to this complex, begin courting as soon as they have their first [[Intrasexual competition|intrasexual]] contact. Once the male brushes against a female, courting begins and the male begins to follow the female. The male initiates in courtship song through vibration of his wings. The male will choose to either follow a side of the female or follow behind her. Depending on the spot the male decides to occupy will determine the vibrational frequency of the male's wings. The farther the male is to the female, the shorter the wing pulses are. When the female stops moving, vibrational frequency increases. During this courtship song, the male may chose to lick the genitals of the female. If the female chooses to accept a male during his courting song, the female's wings will expand and the male will terminate his song. The flies will begin to copulate soon after.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Spangler HG, Heed WB|date=January 1995|title=Courtship sounds and behaviour of the two saguaro-breeding Drosophila and their relatives.|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1031\u20139|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80103-0}}</ref> In comparison to other species in the Eremophila complex, males of ''D. mettleri'' are more likely to force copulation with females.\n\n===Courtship song===\nThe courting song of ''D. mettleri'' is characterized by distinct vibrational pulses and frequencies. The more mobile a female is, the more irregular the vibrational pulses of the male will be. To initiate the courting song, a male will extend his wings seventy-eighty degrees and release a few short pulses. After the initiation process, more regular pulses are released by males.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\" />\n\n=== Male-female controls ===\nIn ''D. mettleri'', after the male inserts his sperm (i.e. ejaculates) into his mate, swelling of the vaginal wall occurs. This may serve as a copulatory plug that serves as a defense against other males copulating and having offspring with the female. The male is then enabled to ensure his own paternity. This is an adaptation by the males of ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0as females of this species re-mate many times and will selectively fertilize her eggs. The copulatory plug has been shown to ensure paternity of the father, but there is no evidence of this plug serving any selection purposes. \u00a0\n\n6-8 hours after the insemination process occurs, a female will get rid of any excess sperm and the material that was used as a copulatory plug by her mate. This shows that both the male and females in the relationship have control over the sexual behaviors and outcomes of the opposite sex.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Tolbert LP, Heed WB|date=March 1994|title=Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=275|issue=3|pages=467\u201379|doi=10.1007/BF00318816|pmid=8137397}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:Parasite140083-fig1 Figs 1-7 Neoechinorhynchus (Hebesoma) spiramuscularis.tif|left|thumb|A sketch shows the reproductive architecture in a female fly.]]\n<br />\n==== Ejaculation material ====\nThe ejaculate material from the male serves a larger purpose than acting as a copulatory plug. The fluid may serve as a source of nutrients, and can also affect the time it takes for sperm activation to occur as well as the time of oviposition. The nutrients found in this fluid have been shown to increase egg size and to increase the quantity of eggs laid by the female (depending on the nutrient density of the fluid). Thus, the quality of this fluid limits or increases the female's reproductive success. The amount of fluid a male will contribute during a mating is dependent on the species of the Sonoran Desert drosophila. In ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0males make large ejaculatory investments when mating, and thus the male's fluid quality plays a large role in the development of the larvae.\n\n=== Ejaculation nutrients' role in monogamy ===\nThe costs of having only one reproductive partner due to effects of the plug must be outweighed by the nutrient benefits gained by the ejaculated material. The cost to benefit trade-off is dependent upon resource availability and is highly regulated by the distribution and growth of rot material.  In D. ''mettleri'', there has been an evolutionary drive toward greater reproductive success of males donating the best quality and quantity of fluid. Radio-labeling was used to measure the amount of fluid incorporated into female egg production (and thus not removed from the body after 6-8 hours). They found that females with the largest vaginal swellings incorporated the highest amount of sperm from a single male partner than did females who had smaller vaginal swellings (and thus had the option to re-mate). Other Dipterans who do not have females undergoing an insemination process were also observed; no radio-labeled material was found in the eggs of these females, showing that the insemination process characteristic of D. ''mettleri'' and other Desert Drosophila is essential in male paternity assurance.<ref name=\"pmid28568832\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pitnick S, Markow TA, Riedy MF|date=May 1991|title=Transfer of Ejaculate and Incorporation of Male-Derived Substances by Females in the Nannoptera Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=45|issue=3|pages=774\u2013780|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04347.x|pmid=28568832}}</ref>\n\n=== Not all are monogamous ===\nA study published in 2012 did extensive research into the reproductive biology of ''D. mettleri'' and correlating information to its reproductive behaviors. Male flies mature more quickly than female flies do, but the study showed this is not the pivotal factor in why many wild females either lack sperm or exploit sperm sources too quickly once inseminated. The researchers concluded that the quick cycling of sperm in females explains why there may be frequent remating in this species both in the lab and in nature. The study also found that there were no consequences to life spans of females that had remated more than other females. In fact, a few benefits to multiple mating for females include greater female postcopulatory control of sperm and greater success of offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese A.|last2=Beall|first2=Stephen|last3=Castrezana|first3=Sergio|date=2012-04-01|title=The wild side of life|journal=Fly|volume=6|issue=2|pages=98\u2013101|doi=10.4161/fly.19552|issn=1933-6934|pmid=22627903|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Parental care==\n===Oviposition===\nAs [[Necrotroph|necrotrophs]], these flies are known to lay their eggs in the rotting refuse of dying cacti. In comparison to other necrotrophs in the desert, ''D. metlerri'' prefers to breed in soils entrenched in the liquid of these rotting cacti rather than breeding in the tissues of cacti that contain these juices. The significance of this behavior is that the arid conditions of the desert lead to extreme water loss in the cacti, and resulting liquid toxins trailing into nearby soil is concentrated to a magnitude other nectrotrophs cannot detoxify. Thus, the detoxification capacity of ''D. metlerri'' enables it to breed in a niche environment not exploited commonly by other species.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fogleman JC, Heed WB, Kircher HW|date=January 1982|title=Drosophila mettleri and senita cactus alkaloids: fitness measurements and their ecological significance.|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=413\u20137|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(82)90427-3}}</ref>\n\nThe specialized detoxification abilities of ''D. mettleri'' have been tested in order to see if host-plant shifts would lead to changes on the genetic level in future offspring of flies exploiting cacti with different chemical compositions than those of their typical host cacti (senita and saguaro).<ref name=\"pmid26384860\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoang K, Matzkin LM, Bono JM|date=October 2015|title=Transcriptional variation associated with cactus host plant adaptation in Drosophila mettleri populations|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|issue=20|pages=5186\u201399|doi=10.1111/mec.13388|pmid=26384860}}</ref> Future generations showed transcriptional changes in genes triggering different metabolic pathways better equipped to detoxify the variant chemical environment of their host-cacti.\n\n==Enemies==\n===Parasites===\n''Drosophila'' species, including ''D. mettleri'' and others in its phylogenetic lineage, show predatory pressure by [[Ectoparasitic|ectoparasistic]] [[Mite|mites]] that live in the necrotic rotting spots on desert cacti.

His voice provides commentary through the ride heard via onboard speakers in the [[Omnimover]] ride vehicle. The character is voiced with a [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic accented]] voice provided by [[Paul Frees]] that has been described as \"gleefully sardonic\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = DoomBuggies > Explore the history and marvel at the mystery of Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions!|url = http://www.doombuggies.com/history5.php|website = www.doombuggies.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}</ref> The hanging corpse seen in the Stretching Room implies that he committed suicide.\n\nThe character is given the name 'Master Gracey' in some related media such as the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] and [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]]; a name featured on a tombstone in the queue. This connection was originally popularized by fans. It is an homage to master effects designer [[Yale Gracey]] who created most of the special effects in the mansion.\n\nIn the 1969 record album ''The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'', the Ghost Host was voiced by [[Pete Renaday]], using an accent and manner of speaking inspired by English actor [[Boris Karloff]]. During ''[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]'', the Ghost Host is voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. In the Tokyo Disneyland Haunted Mansion, the character is voiced in Japanese by Teichiro Hori.\n\nThe character is known as the Phantom in ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris. He was originally voiced in English by [[Vincent Price]], but was replaced by French actor G\u00e9rard Ch\u00e9valier soon after the attraction opened due to French Regulations that required the voice to be only in French Accent. After the 2019 renovation both voices were used.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Ghost Host's famous line \"Welcome, foolish mortals\" was reproduced by [[Corey Burton]] in the opening titles of the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] as a tribute to Paul Frees. The DVD release of the film has an interactive tour of the film's mansion as a special feature, with the late British actor [[Tony Jay]] voicing the Ghost Host. For the feature, the Ghost Host gives instructions on how to proceed with the tour.\n\nThe film's Master Gracey ([[Nathaniel Parker]]), given the name Edward, is shown to be separate from the Ghost Host although he is a mix of the Ghost Host, the aging man portrait, and the original Master Gracey in the attraction. The character fell in love with Elizabeth Henshaw, the beautiful multiracial daughter of one of the manor's mixed-race servants, who in turn, also fell in love with him and wrote a promise of marriage in a letter. However, the family's butler Ramsley ([[Terence Stamp]]), seeing his actions as a disgrace to the family, murdered her with a poisoned cup of wine and gave Edward a false letter from Elizabeth that he had penned himself which led Edward to believe that Elizabeth had never loved him, causing him to hang himself from the ceiling of the mansion in his grief while Elizabeth's real letter, which was confiscated and hidden by Ramsley. After she died, her spirit remained in the mansion as an orb (or \"ghost ball\"). Edward still loved her, and anxiously awaited her return, which was prophesied by a gypsy woman named Madame Leota. When a flyer for Evers & Evers Real Estate was 'delivered' to the mansion by chance, Gracey became convinced that Sara Evers was the reincarnation of Elizabeth, and arranged for her to come to the mansion, with Ramsley forcing her to go along with this belief by threatening her children. After Jim Evers ([[Eddie Murphy]]) reveals the truth to Edward, Ramsley is condemned to Hell for his actions and Elizabeth reunites with Edward, who gives the Evers family the deed to the house, before ascending to Heaven with the rest of the spirits. \n\nIn 2010 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], a teaser for a new ''Haunted Mansion'' film being produced by [[Guillermo del Toro]] was shown, in which [[Ian McShane]] provided the voice of the Ghost Host.\n\n== Stretching Portraits ==\nThe following characters are depicted in the portraits of the Stretching Room:\n* '''Balding man''': brown mustache and beard, dressed in a black tailcoat, a white shirt, a red sash and a black bowtie. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that he is not wearing pants (only red and white striped boxer shorts) and he is standing atop a lit keg of dynamite. In an early attraction script, which gave the names of the characters in the stretching portraits, he was an ambassador named Alexander Nitrokoff, who came to the Mansion one night \"with a bang\". In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], he was a visually impaired man named Steven who was invited to a party at [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Host|Gracey Manor]]. Once Steven arrived at the Manor (sans pants), his glasses were flicked off by the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]]. Due to his poor eyesight, he wandered the house completely oblivious to the ghosts and ended up lighting a keg of dynamite with a candle. The game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' features a similar painting of a man standing on a barrel of [[TNT]].\n\n* '''Old Woman''': holding a rose and smiling. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that she is seated on top of the tombstone of her late husband, George, who is depicted as a marble bust with his head split by an ax.\n\n* '''Brown-haired Man''': arms crossed, dressed in a brown suit and wearing a brown derby hat. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that he is sitting on the shoulders of another man, who is sitting on the shoulders of yet another man who is waist-deep in quicksand. In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the three men were gamblers known as Hobbs, Big Hobbs and Skinny Hobbs.\n\n*'''Tightrope Walker ''(aliases: Lillian Gracey, Ally Gal, Sarah \"Sally\" Slater, Daisy De La Cruz, and Lillian O'Malley)''''': A pretty young brunette holding a pink parasol. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that she is balancing on a fraying tightrope above the gaping jaws of a crocodile. This ghost has had many names attributed to her. Walt Disney World's cast members call her \"Lillian Gracey\" and say she strung her rope across to Tom Sawyer's Island from the Mansion grounds, where she met her fate. In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the girl was a witch named Daisy de la Cruz, who turned men into crocodiles. This was also her name in 2014 Haunt Your Disney Side event. More recent [[imagineering]] projects have given her the name \"Sally Slater\", starting from the 2011 interactive queue for the Walt Disney World version of the attraction and continuing in the 2016 Ghost Post ARG, where she is voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] in the interactive app portions. The unofficial Ghost Gallery storyline states that she was the Ghost Host's first wife, Lillian O'Malley and that the alligator was summoned by [[Madame Leota]] who was jealous of her relationship with the Host.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Tightrope Walker appears in the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film adaptation]] as one of the ghosts in the graveyard and is seen sitting on a tree branch with the \"Old Lady's Ghost\" as the camera shows the duelists.\n\nIn 2019, \"Host-A-Ghost\" Jars were sold that identified the tightrope walker as Sarah \"Sally\" Slater.\n\nIn the Haunted Mansion comics, her name was Daisy de la Cruz; in this version, she was, against all odds, actually the villain, while the alligator was the victim, as she was presented as a nefarious sorceress who'd turn her lovers into alligators.\n \nTightrope Walker character was impersonated by a cast members who would wander through Disneyland, talking with visitors. In those appearances, the name of \"Daisy de la Cruz\" was taken from her comic incarnation, even though the \"witch\" backstory was not referenced by the character.\n\n== Changing portraits ==\n* '''The Werecat Lady''' \u2013 a woman reclining on daybed changes into a striped panther.\n* '''Aging Man''' \u2013 a young man morphs to a decaying corpse. Fans name the portrait as \"Master Gracey\".\n* '''The Flying Dutchman''' \u2013 a sailing ship changes into a ghost version of itself.\n* '''Edward the Black Prince''' \u2013 a knight and his horse change into skeletons. The 2003 film also has a similar painting but is based on [[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]], while the same effect is applied on [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his horse.\n* '''Medusa''' \u2013 a young woman changes from her human form to gorgon form.\n\n== Madame Leota ==\nMadame Leota appears in the ride as a head encased within a crystal ball. She is the spirit of a [[psychic medium]], conducting an otherworldly [[s\u00e9ance]] in an attempt to summon spirits and assist them in materializing. Her ghostly head appears on a table in the middle of her dark chamber, from which she speaks her incantations. Musical instruments and furniture levitate and make noises in response. She was played by Leota Toombs (face) and [[Eleanor Audley]] (voice). Before Toombs was chosen for the face of the medium in the crystal ball, Imagineer [[Harriet Burns]] was tested for the part. Toombs also played the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Hostess|Ghost Hostess]] who appears at the end of the attraction.\n\nIn 2001, a tombstone for Madame Leota debuted at Walt Disney World's Mansion. The epitaph reads: \"Dear sweet Leota, beloved by all. In regions beyond now, but having a ball.\" The face on the tombstone periodically shifts and opens its eyes. In 2006, Disneyland's Madame Leota was given the ability to float above the table in mid-air, via wires. This effect, along with the spell-book, was installed into the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion during the 2007 refurbishment. In the Servants Quarters (Walt Disney World), there is a bell for Madame Leota's Boudoir. Near the mansion in Walt Disney World, there is a newly opened shop named \"Memento Mori\" that has many references to Madame Leota.\n\nDuring ''[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]'' at Disneyland, she was played by Leota Toombs' daughter Kim Irvine (face) and [[Suzanne Blakeslee]] (voice).\n\nIn ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris, Madame Leota was played by Oona Lind. Her incantations are different from those of the attractions in California, Florida, and Tokyo, and they alternate between English and French.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nMadame Leota was portrayed by [[Jennifer Tilly]] in the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]]. She first appears when [[Eddie Murphy]]'s character, Jim Evers, stumbles upon her chamber while trying to find his way out of a secret passage. Leota then tells him and his children, Michael and Megan about how the mansion was cursed and how to break it before sending them with servants Ezra and Emma to the graveyard to find the \"clue\" to break the curse, which turns out to be a skeleton key hidden in a mausoleum crypt. When the protagonists retrieve the key, Leota leads them to a trunk in the attic which contains the secret of the curse; a letter from Elizabeth, the fianc\u00e9e of the mansion's master Edward Gracey, only for Ramsley to banish everyone. Leota is depicted as a helpful person when she tells Jim on how to break back in the mansion and rescue his family then reveal the truth of Ramsley's evil plans to the master. After Gracey and Elizabeth are reunited in the afterlife, Leota becomes part of the Evers family and joins them in their vacation.\n\nIn the [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|2003 video game]], Leota acts as the secondary main protagonist and aids the player character, Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Halloway in navigating the Mansion to restore peace in the residence and free her six friends as well as other spirits from the game's villain, Atticus Thorn, who has enslaved them when his group, the Order of Shadows, took over the estate. At the game's conclusion, Zeke reveals that he had become a successful author and writer with Madame Leota's guidance. This version of Leota speaks with a Southern accent, which implies that she was born and raised in the American south.\n\nIn [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]], Leota was killed mid-trance by William Gracey, and doesn't realize that she's dead.\n\nIn the Haunted Mansion level of the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', a malevolent Madame Leota (voiced by Suzanne Blakeslee) is encountered upon entering the Mansion, in the Stretching Room.\n\nThe video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' has its own version of the character, named Madame Leona, who is the librarian of Lonesome Manor.\n\nMadame Leota appears in the eleventh episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', \"[[Secret Garden (Once Upon a Time)|Secret Garden]]\", played by Suzy Joachim.<ref>http://www.disneyabcpress.com/abc/pressrelease/once-upon-a-time-secret-garden-32/</ref> In the series, Madame Leota is a witch, member of the Coven of the Eight,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/15/once-upon-a-time-coven-eight-spoilers/|title='Once Upon a Time' bosses on rise of new big bad|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref> whose leader is [[Mother Gothel]].\n\n== Bride ==\nThe Bride, one of the Mansion's most enigmatic characters, haunts the Attic. Inspiration for the character can be traced back to legends including the [[Brown Lady of Raynham Hall]]. The Bride has been altered on numerous occasions over the years, appearing now at Disneyland and Walt Disney World as '''Constance Hatchaway'''\u2014the \"Black Widow Bride\", using a digital projection effect. In the ''Phantom Manor'' version, the bride is '''M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood''' who appears in several parts of the manor throughout the attraction, and is firmly established as a key character in the storyline of the mansion.\n\n===Original Incarnation===\nThe original incarnation of the Bride was a skeletal corpse with glowing eyes, clutching a candle in one hand and a bouquet in the other. The sound of her beating heart filled the attic, and it could be seen glowing red within her chest. Her groom (according to the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album), the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]], was removed shortly after the attraction opened, as his \"disappearing head\" effect was unconvincing under the scene's lighting conditions. Her final incarnation was that of a fully-fleshed spirit with a sad face, with her veil either opened or closed. Several \"blast-up\" and \"pop-up\" ghosts were also featured in the attic until they were removed with the \"Black Widow Bride\" update. These, however, remain in the Tokyo mansion along with the original bride,\n\nAt one point a story circulated that the Bride's ring was embedded in the exterior exit path of Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion. The object was actually what remained of a crowd-control [[stanchion]] that had been cut down. It was removed during 2007's Re-Haunting. In November 2016 when the new interactive queue was added, an \"official\" Bride's ring was embedded in the path to honor the popular legend.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe bride does not appear in the 2003 film but she is frequently referenced through the character, Elizabeth Henshaw. Other references include the film's attic scene due to the presence of a stored wedding dress and the botched wedding ceremony scene, wherein one of the main protagonists, Sara Evers, wears the aforementioned wedding dress while the \"out of tune\" rendition of the Bridal March does the same while referencing the ride's attic. \n\nThe Bride also appears in the [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|2003 video game]], but as a friendly ghost encountered in the \"Maids' Room\" level. Similar to the original incarnation, the character holds a candle and a bouquet but the beating heart element is eliminated.\n\nIn the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the bride is named Emily De Claire.\n\nThe storyline of ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris revolves around a bride named Melanie Ravenswood who is tormented by the sinister Phantom.\n\n=== Constance Hatchaway ===\n{{main|The Haunted Mansion}}\nDuring the 2006 upgrades at Disneyland, the Bride was given a name, a new look, and a backstory. In the late 19th century, Constance married\u2014and murdered\u2014at least five wealthy men and inherited their fortunes. Her ghost utters sinister variations on classic wedding vows as a hatchet materializes in her hands. The visible beating heart from the previous versions of the Bride was not carried over to Constance, but its audio remains on the soundtrack. While much of Constance's story is left to the imagination, there are some hints in the newly decorated attic that give guests some insight into the character. A series of wedding photographs can be seen among various gifts and ceremonial trappings, and as guests pass each photo the heads of Constance's former grooms disappear while the number of pearl necklaces around Constance's neck grows. In the last photo, Constance holds a rose while posing next to her groom [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Grooms|George Hightower]]. This echoes the portrait (in the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Stretching Portrait Characters|stretching room]]) of a much older Constance holding a rose as she sits atop the tombstone of her late husband George, whose stone bust has a hatchet lodged in its head. (In an early attraction script, the widow in the stretching portrait was named Abigale Patecleaver.) Though Constance's ghost manifests as a young woman, she apparently lived to see old age. It has been speculated that the Hatbox Ghost was one of Constances' murdered husbands, or possibly her accomplice in the crimes.\n\nConstance was later installed at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion during the 2007 refurbishment, though considerable work was done on her Floridian counterpart (including utilizing different video footage and switching to a single projector instead of two at Disneyland).\n\nThe performance model of Constance is Julia Lee while she is voiced by [[Kat Cressida]].\n\n;Appearances in other media\nIn the [[Wii]] game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', [[Horace Horsecollar]] (who runs the Detective Agency in the Wasteland) sends [[Mickey Mouse]] on a quest to find Constance's murder weapon. As Horace explains to Mickey, \"Constance Hatchaway was once the Lady of Lonesome Manor. Several of her husbands... expired. There were suspicions but no evidence. Mrs. Hatchaway hid a hatchet in the house.\"\n\nIn the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', Constance haunts the Ballroom and serves as a boss. Her appearance is based on the pre-2006 version of the character, complete with candle and bouquet.\n\n===M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood===\n{{section-stub|date=September 2019}}\n{{main|Phantom Manor}}\nMelanie Ravenswood is a prominent character featured in the Disneyland Paris attraction, Phantom Manor. She is a ghost of a bride, whose groom never materialized on their wedding day. Melanie Ravenswood was born to Henry Ravenswood and Martha Ravenswood in 1842. Her father was a Western settler who struck gold in Big Thunder Mountain and founded the Thunder Mesa Mining Company, thus creating the town of Thunder Mesa. Ravenswood became rich and built himself a grand Victorian manor high on Boot Hill overlooking Big Thunder Mountain, where Melanie was raised. At this point in her ill-fated life, Melanie has grown into a beautiful young woman. As part of the 2019 refurbishment, she had 4 suitors. They all died sudden and horrible deaths according to their profession, as seen in the Phantom Manor stretching room. It is suspected that the Phantom killed Melanie's late suitors.\n\n==The Phantom==\n{{main|Phantom Manor}}\nThe Phantom is the main antagonist of Phantom Manor who torments the ghost of M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood. In life, he was known as \"Henry Ravenswood\" and is the father of Melanie Ravenswood. The Phantom fills the role of the Ghost Host in the attraction, his voice guiding guests through most of the early parts of their tour.  Though originally portrayed in English by [[Vincent Price]], only his manic laugh is still heard in the attraction. The narration in the foyer and stretching room was provided by another actor, in French, although sounding as close to Price as possible.\n\nIn the 2019 refurb, he is explicitly Henry Ravenswood's vengeful shade, whereas the original kept his identity somewhat more ambiguous, though heavily implying he was Ravenswood. Vincent Price also returned as the voice of the Phantom, along with Bernard Alane doing the French parts. \n\n== Organist ==\nAt the attraction's ballroom is a ghostly organist dressed in formal wear with a cape and top hat. He plays \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" as a macabre waltz on the ballroom's pipe organ. Tiny wisp-like spirits emerge from the organ's pipes as the organist plays. As it says in the little booklet that comes with the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album, it says that the figures are banshees (female spirits whose wailing warn of an impending death in the household).\n\nIn the original Disneyland version of the attraction, the organ console is the original prop of the organ used by Captain Nemo in the 1954 film, \"[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]\". While the console is the same, the noticeable differences are that of the bat-shape note stand which replaced the mirror from the film and the taller set of pipes that replaces the fan-shaped pipes of Nemo's organ to better complement the ballroom's dimensions and to make a good effect on the skull-like spirits floating out of the pipes.\n\n;Other appearances\n\nThe organist appears in [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)]] as one of the six friendly ghosts who are enslaved by the game's villain, Atticus Thorn. Unlike the ride, the character is depicted without a hat but retains his cloak and is shown to be short-tempered and rude, on the manner that he refers to the game's protagonist, Zeke Halloway, as \"beggar\" and is always upset when his playing is interrupted. However, despite some of his negative attitudes, he is also shown to be a little bit nice and appreciates Zeke's efforts to restore the Mansion and thanks him for setting him as well as his friends and the other spirits free from Thorn's control. The character gives Zeke a second weapon upgrade.\n\nWhile the character does not appear in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adoption]], there is a homage to him wherein one of the supporting characters, Ezra ([[Wallace Shawn]]) is shown wearing a cape and a hat and plays an off-key rendition of [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bridal Chorus]] during the film's botched wedding ceremony.\n\n== Hatbox Ghost ==\n{{Main|Hatbox Ghost}}\nThe Hatbox Ghost was a character who originally appeared in the attic, on the opposite side of the room from the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Bride|Bride]]. He was a cloaked figure with a grinning skeletal face, clutching a cane with a trembling hand. His head would disappear from his body and reappear from within the hat box he held in his other hand. He was removed shortly after the attraction opened at [[Disneyland]] due to the effect not working as intended. In the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album, he is identified as the Bride's groom (''\"with each beat of his bride's heart...\"''). The headless groom theme was re-introduced into the attic scene in 2006, as part of the \"[[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Constance Hatchaway|Black Widow Bride]]\" storyline.\n\n[[Guillermo del Toro]] has stated that his upcoming ''Haunted Mansion'' film will feature the Hatbox Ghost as a pivotal figure in the story, and that the mythology of the Mansion will be centered around the character. Del Toro analogized his version of the Hatbox Ghost to a spider sitting in the middle of a \"web\" of Haunted Mansions.\n\nThe look of the Hatbox Ghost may have been inspired by the Man in the Beaver Hat, played by [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] in the 1927 film, ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]''.\n\nAfter the end of the 2014 Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay, and when the Mansion was returned to its original state, guests observed what appeared to be a temporary work walk at the end of the attic scene.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Chilling Challenge: What\u2019s Hiding Inside the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park?|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/01/chilling-challenge-whats-hiding-inside-the-haunted-mansion-at-disneyland-park/|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=January 30, 2015|date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> This created much speculation that the Hatbox Ghost would return as part of the park\u2019s 60th anniversary. On April 10, 2015, it was officially confirmed that the Hatbox Ghost would return to Disneyland's Haunted Mansion in May of 2015. The first day of the character's return was May 9, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Legendary Hatbox Ghost Comes Out to Socialize in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park in May|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/04/legendary-hatbox-ghost-comes-out-to-socialize-in-the-haunted-mansion-at-disneyland-park-in-may/|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=April 10, 2015|date=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== The Groundskeeper ==\nThe groundskeeper ''(also known as '''\"The Caretaker\"''')'' is a man who tends to the Mansion's upkeep but is stopped in his tracks when he effectively joins the guests' tour in seeing the ghosts' materializing at night. He is seen standing just outside the graveyard gates, next to a lamppost, raising a lantern in his shaking hand, and is visibly terrified. A shaking hound dog accompanies him, presumably his pet. In his other hand he holds a shovel, which either aids in his groundskeeping or could suggest alternatively he is a grave-robber caught in the act by the ghosts.\n\nIt is often pointed out that he is the only 'living' audio-animatronic seen throughout the entire ride.\n\nThe groundskeeper features prominently in [[D. W. Frydendall]]'s [[comic book]] series based on the ride, and is identified as Horace Fusslebottom.\n\n;Appearances in other media\n\nThe groundskeeper and his dog appear in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adaptation]] as ghostly versions of themselves in the graveyard scene. The dog's breed is identified as a [[Labrador Retriever]] and is shown to be healthy in shape unlike the ride where it appears as a skinny unknown breed. An original script had the Groundskeeper as a supporting character played by [[Don Knotts]], who later dropped out before shooting began.\n\nIn [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|the video game]], the groundskeeper also makes an appearance as a ghost but his dog is omitted. The character is seen in the Winter Garden as a disgruntled ghost who complains about the absence of someone who is to pay him for his work. He only appears when the level is completed. It is also noted however that the player character and primary main protagonist, Zeke Halloway, was partially inspired by the groundskeeper.\n\n== Singing Busts ==\n[[File:Disneyland Haunted Mansion Singing Busts.jpg|thumb|alt=Singing Busts|The Singing Busts in the graveyard scene]]A quintet of marble busts sing ''[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]'' amidst the revelry in the graveyard. Their names are (from left to right): Rollo Rumkin, Uncle Theodore, Cousin Algernon, Ned Nub, and Phineas P. Pock. The original concept art for talking or singing busts by [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] included a female, [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Watchful Busts|Aunt Lucretia]]. The busts can also be seen in ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris, minus Cousin Algernon.\n* '''Rollo Rumkin''': \"Lived and died a friendly bumpkin\", according to his [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Rollo Rumkin|tombstone]] (spelled Rolo on the stone), which was originally located in the family plot outside of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion. His name is a tribute to Imagineer Rolly Crump. He was played by Verne Rowe. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Rollo Rumkin debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Uncle Theodore''': The lead singing bust, whose head is broken off, was played by the deep-voiced [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] (known for singing ''[[You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]'' and providing the voice of [[Tony the Tiger]]). He is often incorrectly identified as [[Walt Disney]]. Ravenscroft also narrated the 1969 record ''The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion''. In [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]], Uncle Theodore narrates ''Doom of the Diva'', the tale of [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Opera Singers|Baronessa Elda]]. In the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] (like in the attraction), Thurl Ravenscroft's likeness was used for one of the singing busts. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone that reads \"In memory of Uncle Theodore\" debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue. In Phantom Manor, his head has not broken off of the bust, but it is leaning over to the side a little, mimicking the broken head in the American mansions and in Tokyo.\n* '''Cousin Algernon''': Distinguishable from the other busts by his derby hat. He was played by Chuck Schroeder. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Cousin Algernon debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Ned Nub''': The only bust without a necktie. He was played by Jay Meyer. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Ned Nub debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Phineas P. Pock''': The very bust with a necktie. Relative of the poet Prudence Pock. He was played by Bob Ebright. The name Phineas Pock has appeared elsewhere in ''Haunted Mansion'' lore. A tombstone with the name Phineas Pock was featured in the original family plot at Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, but it may not have been the same character as the singing bust. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Phineas Pock debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThey were voiced by the [[Dapper Dans]] in [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|the video game]] and the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adaptation]]. However, in these two adaptations, they are reduced to a quartet instead of appearing as five.\n\nIn the [[Wii]] game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', the original five busts make an appearance in a [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Stretching Portrait Characters|stretching portrait]] inside Lonesome Manor. In the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', four of the busts appear in the queue area outside of the Mansion, and can be conducted.\n\nThe Disney animated film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' features an homage during the song ''[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]'', in which the  [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#The Muses|Muses]] appear as singing busts and are arranged in the same way as the ''Haunted Mansion'' characters.\n\n== Hitchhiking Ghosts ==\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are a tongue-in-cheek send-up of [[Vanishing hitchhiker|urban legends involving phantom hitchhikers]]. They are also said to be the attraction's mascots due to their appearances in many merchandise. They have also been known to be the \"funny ghosts\".\n\nNear the end of the ride, the trio are encountered standing together inside a crypt, with thumbs extended. They hitch a ride with guests traveling in Doom Buggies and appear alongside them in mirrors. \"They have selected you to fill our quota, and they'll haunt you until you return\", says the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Host|Ghost Host]]. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, the mirror scene was updated with digital effects that enable the ghosts to interact with the guests. The vocals for Walt Disney World's computer-generated ghosts were provided by actor Kurt von Schmittou.\n\nThe Prisoner is a short, hairy little ghost with a ball and chain shackled to his ankle.\n\nThe Skeleton is a tall, dapper, grinning ghost. When the attraction first opened at Disneyland, he was completely bald, but has since had hair of varying lengths. Although the Skeleton figure has the same face mold as the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]], they are not meant to be the same character. In Marc Davis' original concept art, the character was a stereotypical \"sheet ghost\" with no clothes, save for the [[bowler hat]] he lifted above his head. By the time the attraction opened, the character had evolved into the fully clothed skeletal ghost seen in the Mansion today.\n\nThe Traveler is an overweight [[hunchback]] wearing a [[top hat]] and holding a [[carpet bag]].\n\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are often referred to as [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Gus|\"Gus\"]] (Prisoner), [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ezra|\"Ezra\"]] (Skeleton), and \"Phineas\" (Traveler). These names are thought to have originated from and popularised by Cast Members who worked at the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion, and further spread by fans. Since then, the names have appeared on merchandise for the characters and in various media licensed by Disney. When the subject was brought up in a 2006 interview, Imagineer Jason Surrell said, \"Their names are not Ezra, Phineas, and Gus. I don't know where it came from. I know at one point, Cast Members contributed to this website that names all the ghosts and gives them backstories. None of those have any basis in Imagineering story, or anything like that. But somehow Ezra, Phineas, and Gus in particular managed to stick, so in the book about the only thing I could do is acknowledge that and say it's not official, but acknowledge it at the same time.\" When the interactive queue was installed outside of the Walt Disney World attraction in 2011, tombstones with the names Gus and Ezra were added. Also added was a tombstone for [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Phineas Pock|Phineas Pock]], though this is a reference to the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Singing Busts|singing bust character]], and not the Traveler hitchhiking ghost.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts make a brief appearance in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film]], passed by the hearse carrying the Evers family through the graveyard, striking their signature pose. As Jim Evers ([[Eddie Murphy]]) is startled by their appearance, the Traveler and Prisoner ''(played by [[Deep Roy]])'' argue how the Evers see them, thinking they are invisible until the Prisoner accuses Jim as a liar and psychic as the Skeleton ''(played by [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]])'' observes silently. Unlike their ride counterparts, the trio were the mansion's former servants; the Traveller was the mansion's head chef (complete with French accent), the Skeleton was the coachman, and the Prisoner was the assistant groundskeeper. Early script drafts for the movie have revealed that the three ghosts were going to play larger comic relief supporting roles, similar to the servant characters Emma and Ezra.\n\nThe characters make an appearance in the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''.\n\nIn 2012, a [[Disney Dream Portrait Series]] photograph featured the ghosts with, [[Jack Black]] as The Traveller, [[Will Ferrell]] as The Skeleton, and [[Jason Segel]] as The Prisoner. The actor\u2019s makeup was done by Award-Winning makeup artist, [[Matthew W. Mungle]]. \n\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts made cameo appearances in multiple episodes of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. Most noticeably in the House of Mouse episode \"House Ghosts\", they are freed from a crate by Pete and scare the daylights out of Pete. They also appear in Mickey's House of Villain's where they are freed from a crate by Cruella De Vil and join the villains as they take over the House of Mouse.\n\nIn August 2012, a \"Disney Dream Portrait\" by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] was released, featuring comedic actors [[Jack Black]], [[Will Ferrell]], and [[Jason Segel]] as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n\nThe queue of [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'' features three Audio-Animatronic hitchhiking droids: a former RX pilot droid and two former F-series droids from the attraction's [[Star Tours|original 1989 incarnation]], all posed in the same manner as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n\nIn 2016, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion \"Ghost Post\" in-park scavenger hunt includes the Phantom Radio iOS app with Disney voice veterans Peter Renaday as Ezra, Dee Bradley Baker as Gus and Stephen Stanton as Phineas.\n\n== Little Leota ==\nAlso known as the 'Ghost Hostess', this miniature \"[[White Lady (ghost)|lady in white]]\" type ghost beckons guests to hurry back at the end of the attraction: \"...be sure to bring your death certificate\" says the Little Leota. She was played (face and voice) by Leota Toombs. The character is said to have been inspired by the \"arrangement hostesses\" from the 1965 film ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]''. The character was conceived as being separate to the character of [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Madame Leota|Madame Leota]], however due to being played by the same woman, both characters are sometimes combined in related media.\n\n== The Dread Family ==\nThe Dread Family is a family of six (five busts, with the twins on one bust together) that killed each other out of greed for their family fortune. Their busts are seen while waiting in line and are a part of interactive queue as a murder mystery for the guests to solve. The members of the Dread family are:\n* Uncle Jacob Dread\n* Bertie Dread\n* Aunt Florence McGriffin Dread\n* The Twins, also known as Wellington and Forsythia Dread\n* Cousin Maude Dread\n\nEach bust includes a cryptogram and a small image to help the guest figure out who killed whom. The cryptograms are as follows:\n\n*Uncle Jacob - \"Greed was the poison he had swallowed. He went first, the others followed. His killer's face he surely knew; now try to discover who killed who.\" \nUncle Jacob met his demise when he was poisoned by Bertie with the venom from his (Bertie's) pet snake.\n*Bertie - \"Avid hunter and expert shot, in the end that's what he got.\" \nBertie was killed with a pistol by Aunt Florence as revenge for killing Jacob.\n*Aunt Florence - \"Never did a dishonorable deed, yet found face down in canary seed.\" \nUnfortunately, when Florence shot Bertie, there was a rogue accident, and the Twins' pet [[Domestic canary|canary]] was shot as well. Out of revenge, the twins killed Florence by suffocating her with a bag of canary seed.\n*Wellington and Forsythia - \"Departed life while in their beds, with identical bumps on identical heads.\" \nThe twins were killed by Cousin Maude when she thumped their heads with a mallet.\n*Cousin Maude - \"Our sleeping beauty, who never awoke, the night her dreams went up in smoke.\"\n \nAs the sole survivor of the Dread family, Maude became the heir to Uncle Jacob's fortune. Unfortunately, Maude had put matches in her bun. When she fell asleep, the friction with her pillow caused a fire; ending the story of the murderous Dread Family.\n\nOn the subject of the conceiving the Dread Family, Pete Carsillo of Walt Disney Imagineering said:\n\"I was proposing a lot of new ghosts, (lion tamers, cowboys, robbers, barons), but I had to construct a story for myself to make the cemetery - particularly an interactive one-make sense. If there are 999 ghosts-as divergent as kings, mummies, minstrels, and even Caesar's ghost-there had to be a larger backstory to explain how the eclectic collection of spirits came to be in one place ... beyond Marty Sklar's famous sign from back in 1963... In play testing, we called them the Dread family, although in the final show, they are not called out by the name Dread. Online they are still referred to as the Dread family, and I don't mind that. It kicks the door open for families other than Gracey to live in the Mansion and creates a lot more possibilities\" The Dread family are the first new characters that guests encounter in the interactive queue of the Florida Mansion.\n\nWhen they were introduced in 2010 as part of the new interactive quene, along with two other family members, Whitifield Tarkington and Ruben, that were cut in the final draft. The family also followed a different backstory, as Jacob died of natural causes, the death order was almost parodoxile and they were on a big stone slab showing most of their full body images. It is unknown Jacob\u2019s cause for death and who killed who first and last, but Ruben killed Forsythia in a fire if you overlook his axe and see the candle, Ruben was killed by Florence with a poisoned dessert that she is seen holding, Florence was killed by Whitifield as he is seen mixing something while holding a syringe, Whitifield was killed by Wellington who is seen holding a slingshot, Wellington was killed by Maude who is seen wrapping something around his neck, Maude was killed by Bertie who is seen with his snake, and Bertie was killed by Forsythia who is seen holding a tea-filled cup and a small bottle.

His voice provides commentary through the ride heard via onboard speakers in the [[Omnimover]] ride vehicle. The character is voiced with a [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic accented]] voice provided by [[Paul Frees]] that has been described as \"gleefully sardonic\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = DoomBuggies > Explore the history and marvel at the mystery of Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions!|url = http://www.doombuggies.com/history5.php|website = www.doombuggies.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}</ref> The hanging corpse seen in the Stretching Room implies that he committed suicide.\n\nThe character is given the name 'Master Gracey' in some related media such as the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] and [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]]; a name featured on a tombstone in the queue. This connection was originally popularized by fans. It is an homage to master effects designer [[Yale Gracey]] who created most of the special effects in the mansion.\n\nIn the 1969 record album ''The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'', the Ghost Host was voiced by [[Pete Renaday]], using an accent and manner of speaking inspired by English actor [[Boris Karloff]]. During ''[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]'', the Ghost Host is voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. In the Tokyo Disneyland Haunted Mansion, the character is voiced in Japanese by Teichiro Hori.\n\nThe character is known as the Phantom in ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris. He was originally voiced in English by [[Vincent Price]], but was replaced by French actor G\u00e9rard Ch\u00e9valier soon after the attraction opened due to French Regulations that required the voice to be only in French Accent. After the 2019 renovation both voices were used.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Ghost Host's famous line \"Welcome, foolish mortals\" was reproduced by [[Corey Burton]] in the opening titles of the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] as a tribute to Paul Frees. The DVD release of the film has an interactive tour of the film's mansion as a special feature, with the late British actor [[Tony Jay]] voicing the Ghost Host. For the feature, the Ghost Host gives instructions on how to proceed with the tour.\n\nThe film's Master Gracey ([[Nathaniel Parker]]), given the name Edward, is shown to be separate from the Ghost Host although he is a mix of the Ghost Host, the aging man portrait, and the original Master Gracey in the attraction. The character fell in love with Elizabeth Henshaw, the beautiful multiracial daughter of one of the manor's mixed-race servants, who in turn, also fell in love with him and wrote a promise of marriage in a letter. However, the family's butler Ramsley ([[Terence Stamp]]), seeing his actions as a disgrace to the family, murdered her with a poisoned cup of wine and gave Edward a false letter from Elizabeth that he had penned himself which led Edward to believe that Elizabeth had never loved him, causing him to hang himself from the ceiling of the mansion in his grief while Elizabeth's real letter, which was confiscated and hidden by Ramsley. After she died, her spirit remained in the mansion as an orb (or \"ghost ball\"). Edward still loved her, and anxiously awaited her return, which was prophesied by a gypsy woman named Madame Leota. When a flyer for Evers & Evers Real Estate was 'delivered' to the mansion by chance, Gracey became convinced that Sara Evers was the reincarnation of Elizabeth, and arranged for her to come to the mansion, with Ramsley forcing her to go along with this belief by threatening her children. After Jim Evers ([[Eddie Murphy]]) reveals the truth to Edward, Ramsley is condemned to Hell for his actions and Elizabeth reunites with Edward, who gives the Evers family the deed to the house, before ascending to Heaven with the rest of the spirits. \n\nIn 2010 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], a teaser for a new ''Haunted Mansion'' film being produced by [[Guillermo del Toro]] was shown, in which [[Ian McShane]] provided the voice of the Ghost Host.\n\n== Stretching Portraits ==\nThe following characters are depicted in the portraits of the Stretching Room:\n* '''Balding man''': brown mustache and beard, dressed in a black tailcoat, a white shirt, a red sash and a black bowtie. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that he is not wearing pants (only red and white striped boxer shorts) and he is standing atop a lit keg of dynamite. In an early attraction script, which gave the names of the characters in the stretching portraits, he was an ambassador named Alexander Nitrokoff, who came to the Mansion one night \"with a bang\". In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], he was a visually impaired man named Steven who was invited to a party at [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Host|Gracey Manor]]. Once Steven arrived at the Manor (sans pants), his glasses were flicked off by the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]]. Due to his poor eyesight, he wandered the house completely oblivious to the ghosts and ended up lighting a keg of dynamite with a candle. The game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' features a similar painting of a man standing on a barrel of [[TNT]].\n\n* '''Old Woman''': holding a rose and smiling. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that she is seated on top of the tombstone of her late husband, George, who is depicted as a marble bust with his head split by an ax.\n\n* '''Brown-haired Man''': arms crossed, dressed in a brown suit and wearing a brown derby hat. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that he is sitting on the shoulders of another man, who is sitting on the shoulders of yet another man who is waist-deep in quicksand. In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the three men were gamblers known as Hobbs, Big Hobbs and Skinny Hobbs.\n\n*'''Tightrope Walker ''(aliases: Lillian Gracey, Ally Gal, Sarah \"Sally\" Slater, Daisy De La Cruz, and Lillian O'Malley)''''': A pretty young brunette holding a pink parasol. When the portrait stretches, it is revealed that she is balancing on a fraying tightrope above the gaping jaws of a crocodile. This ghost has had many names attributed to her. Walt Disney World's cast members call her \"Lillian Gracey\" and say she strung her rope across to Tom Sawyer's Island from the Mansion grounds, where she met her fate. In the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the girl was a witch named Daisy de la Cruz, who turned men into crocodiles. This was also her name in 2014 Haunt Your Disney Side event. More recent [[imagineering]] projects have given her the name \"Sally Slater\", starting from the 2011 interactive queue for the Walt Disney World version of the attraction and continuing in the 2016 Ghost Post ARG, where she is voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] in the interactive app portions. The unofficial Ghost Gallery storyline states that she was the Ghost Host's first wife, Lillian O'Malley and that the alligator was summoned by [[Madame Leota]] who was jealous of her relationship with the Host.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Tightrope Walker appears in the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film adaptation]] as one of the ghosts in the graveyard and is seen sitting on a tree branch with the \"Old Lady's Ghost\" as the camera shows the duelists.\n\nIn 2019, \"Host-A-Ghost\" Jars were sold that identified the tightrope walker as Sarah \"Sally\" Slater.\n\nIn the Haunted Mansion comics, her name was Daisy de la Cruz; in this version, she was, against all odds, actually the villain, while the alligator was the victim, as she was presented as a nefarious sorceress who'd turn her lovers into alligators.\n \nTightrope Walker character was impersonated by a cast members who would wander through Disneyland, talking with visitors. In those appearances, the name of \"Daisy de la Cruz\" was taken from her comic incarnation, even though the \"witch\" backstory was not referenced by the character.\n\n== Changing portraits ==\n* '''The Werecat Lady''' \u2013 a woman reclining on daybed changes into a striped panther.\n* '''Aging Man''' \u2013 a young man morphs to a decaying corpse. Fans name the portrait as \"Master Gracey\".\n* '''The Flying Dutchman''' \u2013 a sailing ship changes into a ghost version of itself.\n* '''Edward the Black Prince''' \u2013 a knight and his horse change into skeletons. The 2003 film also has a similar painting but is based on [[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]], while the same effect is applied on [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his horse.\n* '''Medusa''' \u2013 a young woman changes from her human form to gorgon form.\n\n== Madame Leota ==\nMadame Leota appears in the ride as a head encased within a crystal ball. She is the spirit of a [[psychic medium]], conducting an otherworldly [[s\u00e9ance]] in an attempt to summon spirits and assist them in materializing. Her ghostly head appears on a table in the middle of her dark chamber, from which she speaks her incantations. Musical instruments and furniture levitate and make noises in response. She was played by Leota Toombs (face) and [[Eleanor Audley]] (voice). Before Toombs was chosen for the face of the medium in the crystal ball, Imagineer [[Harriet Burns]] was tested for the part. Toombs also played the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Hostess|Ghost Hostess]] who appears at the end of the attraction.\n\nIn 2001, a tombstone for Madame Leota debuted at Walt Disney World's Mansion. The epitaph reads: \"Dear sweet Leota, beloved by all. In regions beyond now, but having a ball.\" The face on the tombstone periodically shifts and opens its eyes. In 2006, Disneyland's Madame Leota was given the ability to float above the table in mid-air, via wires. This effect, along with the spell-book, was installed into the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion during the 2007 refurbishment. In the Servants Quarters (Walt Disney World), there is a bell for Madame Leota's Boudoir. Near the mansion in Walt Disney World, there is a newly opened shop named \"Memento Mori\" that has many references to Madame Leota.\n\nDuring ''[[Haunted Mansion Holiday]]'' at Disneyland, she was played by Leota Toombs' daughter Kim Irvine (face) and [[Suzanne Blakeslee]] (voice).\n\nIn ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris, Madame Leota was played by Oona Lind. Her incantations are different from those of the attractions in California, Florida, and Tokyo, and they alternate between English and French.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nMadame Leota was portrayed by [[Jennifer Tilly]] in the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]]. She first appears when [[Eddie Murphy]]'s character, Jim Evers, stumbles upon her chamber while trying to find his way out of a secret passage. Leota then tells him and his children, Michael and Megan about how the mansion was cursed and how to break it before sending them with servants Ezra and Emma to the graveyard to find the \"clue\" to break the curse, which turns out to be a skeleton key hidden in a mausoleum crypt. When the protagonists retrieve the key, Leota leads them to a trunk in the attic which contains the secret of the curse; a letter from Elizabeth, the fianc\u00e9e of the mansion's master Edward Gracey, only for Ramsley to banish everyone. Leota is depicted as a helpful person when she tells Jim on how to break back in the mansion and rescue his family then reveal the truth of Ramsley's evil plans to the master. After Gracey and Elizabeth are reunited in the afterlife, Leota becomes part of the Evers family and joins them in their vacation.\n\nIn the [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|2003 video game]], Leota acts as the secondary main protagonist and aids the player character, Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Halloway in navigating the Mansion to restore peace in the residence and free her six friends as well as other spirits from the game's villain, Atticus Thorn, who has enslaved them when his group, the Order of Shadows, took over the estate. At the game's conclusion, Zeke reveals that he had become a successful author and writer with Madame Leota's guidance. This version of Leota speaks with a Southern accent, which implies that she was born and raised in the American south.\n\nIn [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]], Leota was killed mid-trance by William Gracey, and doesn't realize that she's dead.\n\nIn the Haunted Mansion level of the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', a malevolent Madame Leota (voiced by Suzanne Blakeslee) is encountered upon entering the Mansion, in the Stretching Room.\n\nThe video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' has its own version of the character, named Madame Leona, who is the librarian of Lonesome Manor.\n\nMadame Leota appears in the eleventh episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', \"[[Secret Garden (Once Upon a Time)|Secret Garden]]\", played by Suzy Joachim.<ref>http://www.disneyabcpress.com/abc/pressrelease/once-upon-a-time-secret-garden-32/</ref> In the series, Madame Leota is a witch, member of the Coven of the Eight,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/15/once-upon-a-time-coven-eight-spoilers/|title='Once Upon a Time' bosses on rise of new big bad|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref> whose leader is [[Mother Gothel]].\n\n== Bride ==\nThe Bride, one of the Mansion's most enigmatic characters, haunts the Attic. Inspiration for the character can be traced back to legends including the [[Brown Lady of Raynham Hall]]. The Bride has been altered on numerous occasions over the years, appearing now at Disneyland and Walt Disney World as '''Constance Hatchaway'''\u2014the \"Black Widow Bride\", using a digital projection effect. In the ''Phantom Manor'' version, the bride is '''M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood''' who appears in several parts of the manor throughout the attraction, and is firmly established as a key character in the storyline of the mansion.\n\n===Original Incarnation===\nThe original incarnation of the Bride was a skeletal corpse with glowing eyes, clutching a candle in one hand and a bouquet in the other. The sound of her beating heart filled the attic, and it could be seen glowing red within her chest. Her groom (according to the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album), the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]], was removed shortly after the attraction opened, as his \"disappearing head\" effect was unconvincing under the scene's lighting conditions. Her final incarnation was that of a fully-fleshed spirit with a sad face, with her veil either opened or closed. Several \"blast-up\" and \"pop-up\" ghosts were also featured in the attic until they were removed with the \"Black Widow Bride\" update. These, however, remain in the Tokyo mansion along with the original bride,\n\nAt one point a story circulated that the Bride's ring was embedded in the exterior exit path of Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion. The object was actually what remained of a crowd-control [[stanchion]] that had been cut down. It was removed during 2007's Re-Haunting. In November 2016 when the new interactive queue was added, an \"official\" Bride's ring was embedded in the path to honor the popular legend.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe bride does not appear in the 2003 film but she is frequently referenced through the character, Elizabeth Henshaw. Other references include the film's attic scene due to the presence of a stored wedding dress and the botched wedding ceremony scene, wherein one of the main protagonists, Sara Evers, wears the aforementioned wedding dress while the \"out of tune\" rendition of the Bridal March does the same while referencing the ride's attic. \n\nThe Bride also appears in the [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|2003 video game]], but as a friendly ghost encountered in the \"Maids' Room\" level. Similar to the original incarnation, the character holds a candle and a bouquet but the beating heart element is eliminated.\n\nIn the [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|comics]], the bride is named Emily De Claire.\n\nThe storyline of ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris revolves around a bride named Melanie Ravenswood who is tormented by the sinister Phantom.\n\n=== Constance Hatchaway ===\n{{main|The Haunted Mansion}}\nDuring the 2006 upgrades at Disneyland, the Bride was given a name, a new look, and a backstory. In the late 19th century, Constance married\u2014and murdered\u2014at least five wealthy men and inherited their fortunes. Her ghost utters sinister variations on classic wedding vows as a hatchet materializes in her hands. The visible beating heart from the previous versions of the Bride was not carried over to Constance, but its audio remains on the soundtrack. While much of Constance's story is left to the imagination, there are some hints in the newly decorated attic that give guests some insight into the character. A series of wedding photographs can be seen among various gifts and ceremonial trappings, and as guests pass each photo the heads of Constance's former grooms disappear while the number of pearl necklaces around Constance's neck grows. In the last photo, Constance holds a rose while posing next to her groom [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Grooms|George Hightower]]. This echoes the portrait (in the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Stretching Portrait Characters|stretching room]]) of a much older Constance holding a rose as she sits atop the tombstone of her late husband George, whose stone bust has a hatchet lodged in its head. (In an early attraction script, the widow in the stretching portrait was named Abigale Patecleaver.) Though Constance's ghost manifests as a young woman, she apparently lived to see old age. It has been speculated that the Hatbox Ghost was one of Constances' murdered husbands, or possibly her accomplice in the crimes.\n\nConstance was later installed at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion during the 2007 refurbishment, though considerable work was done on her Floridian counterpart (including utilizing different video footage and switching to a single projector instead of two at Disneyland).\n\nThe performance model of Constance is Julia Lee while she is voiced by [[Kat Cressida]].\n\n;Appearances in other media\nIn the [[Wii]] game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', [[Horace Horsecollar]] (who runs the Detective Agency in the Wasteland) sends [[Mickey Mouse]] on a quest to find Constance's murder weapon. As Horace explains to Mickey, \"Constance Hatchaway was once the Lady of Lonesome Manor. Several of her husbands... expired. There were suspicions but no evidence. Mrs. Hatchaway hid a hatchet in the house.\"\n\nIn the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', Constance haunts the Ballroom and serves as a boss. Her appearance is based on the pre-2006 version of the character, complete with candle and bouquet.\n\n===M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood===\n{{section-stub|date=September 2019}}\n{{main|Phantom Manor}}\nMelanie Ravenswood is a prominent character featured in the Disneyland Paris attraction, Phantom Manor. She is a ghost of a bride, whose groom never materialized on their wedding day. Melanie Ravenswood was born to Henry Ravenswood and Martha Ravenswood in 1842. Her father was a Western settler who struck gold in Big Thunder Mountain and founded the Thunder Mesa Mining Company, thus creating the town of Thunder Mesa. Ravenswood became rich and built himself a grand Victorian manor high on Boot Hill overlooking Big Thunder Mountain, where Melanie was raised. At this point in her ill-fated life, Melanie has grown into a beautiful young woman. As part of the 2019 refurbishment, she had 4 suitors. They all died sudden and horrible deaths according to their profession, as seen in the Phantom Manor stretching room. It is suspected that the Phantom killed Melanie's late suitors.\n\n==The Phantom==\n{{main|Phantom Manor}}\nThe Phantom is the main antagonist of Phantom Manor who torments the ghost of M\u00e9lanie Ravenswood. In life, he was known as \"Henry Ravenswood\" and is the father of Melanie Ravenswood. The Phantom fills the role of the Ghost Host in the attraction, his voice guiding guests through most of the early parts of their tour.  Though originally portrayed in English by [[Vincent Price]], only his manic laugh is still heard in the attraction. The narration in the foyer and stretching room was provided by another actor, in French, although sounding as close to Price as possible.\n\nIn the 2019 refurb, he is explicitly Henry Ravenswood's vengeful shade, whereas the original kept his identity somewhat more ambiguous, though heavily implying he was Ravenswood. Vincent Price also returned as the voice of the Phantom, along with Bernard Alane doing the French parts. \n\n== Organist ==\nAt the attraction's ballroom is a ghostly organist dressed in formal wear with a cape and top hat. He plays \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" and \"Pink panther\" as a macabre waltz on the ballroom's pipe organ. Tiny wisp-like spirits emerge from the organ's pipes as the organist plays. As it says in the little booklet that comes with the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album, it says that the figures are banshees (female spirits whose wailing warn of an impending death in the household).\n\nIn the original Disneyland version of the attraction, the organ console is the original prop of the organ used by Captain Nemo in the 1954 film, \"[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]\". While the console is the same, the noticeable differences are that of the bat-shape note stand which replaced the mirror from the film and the taller set of pipes that replaces the fan-shaped pipes of Nemo's organ to better complement the ballroom's dimensions and to make a good effect on the skull-like spirits floating out of the pipes.\n\n;Other appearances\n\nThe organist appears in [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)]] as one of the six friendly ghosts who are enslaved by the game's villain, Atticus Thorn. Unlike the ride, the character is depicted without a hat but retains his cloak and is shown to be short-tempered and rude, on the manner that he refers to the game's protagonist, Zeke Halloway, as \"beggar\" and is always upset when his playing is interrupted. However, despite some of his negative attitudes, he is also shown to be a little bit nice and appreciates Zeke's efforts to restore the Mansion and thanks him for setting him as well as his friends and the other spirits free from Thorn's control. The character gives Zeke a second weapon upgrade.\n\nWhile the character does not appear in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adoption]], there is a homage to him wherein one of the supporting characters, Ezra ([[Wallace Shawn]]) is shown wearing a cape and a hat and plays an off-key rendition of [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bridal Chorus]] during the film's botched wedding ceremony.\n\n== Hatbox Ghost ==\n{{Main|Hatbox Ghost}}\nThe Hatbox Ghost was a character who originally appeared in the attic, on the opposite side of the room from the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Bride|Bride]]. He was a cloaked figure with a grinning skeletal face, clutching a cane with a trembling hand. His head would disappear from his body and reappear from within the hat box he held in his other hand. He was removed shortly after the attraction opened at [[Disneyland]] due to the effect not working as intended. In the ''Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion'' album, he is identified as the Bride's groom (''\"with each beat of his bride's heart...\"''). The headless groom theme was re-introduced into the attic scene in 2006, as part of the \"[[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Constance Hatchaway|Black Widow Bride]]\" storyline.\n\n[[Guillermo del Toro]] has stated that his upcoming ''Haunted Mansion'' film will feature the Hatbox Ghost as a pivotal figure in the story, and that the mythology of the Mansion will be centered around the character. Del Toro analogized his version of the Hatbox Ghost to a spider sitting in the middle of a \"web\" of Haunted Mansions.\n\nThe look of the Hatbox Ghost may have been inspired by the Man in the Beaver Hat, played by [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] in the 1927 film, ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]''.\n\nAfter the end of the 2014 Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay, and when the Mansion was returned to its original state, guests observed what appeared to be a temporary work walk at the end of the attic scene.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Chilling Challenge: What\u2019s Hiding Inside the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park?|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/01/chilling-challenge-whats-hiding-inside-the-haunted-mansion-at-disneyland-park/|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=January 30, 2015|date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> This created much speculation that the Hatbox Ghost would return as part of the park\u2019s 60th anniversary. On April 10, 2015, it was officially confirmed that the Hatbox Ghost would return to Disneyland's Haunted Mansion in May of 2015. The first day of the character's return was May 9, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Legendary Hatbox Ghost Comes Out to Socialize in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park in May|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/04/legendary-hatbox-ghost-comes-out-to-socialize-in-the-haunted-mansion-at-disneyland-park-in-may/|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=April 10, 2015|date=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Ghouls ==\nThere are ghouls, Old Hag near hunter, Winky\n\n== The Groundskeeper ==\nThe groundskeeper ''(also known as '''\"The Caretaker\"''')'' is a man who tends to the Mansion's upkeep but is stopped in his tracks when he effectively joins the guests' tour in seeing the ghosts' materializing at night. He is seen standing just outside the graveyard gates, next to a lamppost, raising a lantern in his shaking hand, and is visibly terrified. A shaking hound dog accompanies him, presumably his pet. In his other hand he holds a shovel, which either aids in his groundskeeping or could suggest alternatively he is a grave-robber caught in the act by the ghosts.\n\nIt is often pointed out that he is the only 'living' audio-animatronic seen throughout the entire ride.\n\nThe groundskeeper features prominently in [[D. W. Frydendall]]'s [[comic book]] series based on the ride, and is identified as Horace Fusslebottom.\n\n;Appearances in other media\n\nThe groundskeeper and his dog appear in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adaptation]] as ghostly versions of themselves in the graveyard scene. The dog's breed is identified as a [[Labrador Retriever]] and is shown to be healthy in shape unlike the ride where it appears as a skinny unknown breed. An original script had the Groundskeeper as a supporting character played by [[Don Knotts]], who later dropped out before shooting began.\n\nIn [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|the video game]], the groundskeeper also makes an appearance as a ghost but his dog is omitted. The character is seen in the Winter Garden as a disgruntled ghost who complains about the absence of someone who is to pay him for his work. He only appears when the level is completed. It is also noted however that the player character and primary main protagonist, Zeke Halloway, was partially inspired by the groundskeeper.\n\n== Singing Busts ==\n[[File:Disneyland Haunted Mansion Singing Busts.jpg|thumb|alt=Singing Busts|The Singing Busts in the graveyard scene]]A quintet of marble busts sing ''[[Grim Grinning Ghosts]]'' amidst the revelry in the graveyard. Their names are (from left to right): Rollo Rumkin, Uncle Theodore, Cousin Algernon, Ned Nub, and Phineas P. Pock. The original concept art for talking or singing busts by [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] included a female, [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Watchful Busts|Aunt Lucretia]]. The busts can also be seen in ''[[Phantom Manor]]'' at Disneyland Paris, minus Cousin Algernon.\n* '''Rollo Rumkin''': \"Lived and died a friendly bumpkin\", according to his [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Rollo Rumkin|tombstone]] (spelled Rolo on the stone), which was originally located in the family plot outside of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion. His name is a tribute to Imagineer Rolly Crump. He was played by Verne Rowe. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Rollo Rumkin debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Uncle Theodore''': The lead singing bust, whose head is broken off, was played by the deep-voiced [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] (known for singing ''[[You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]'' and providing the voice of [[Tony the Tiger]]). He is often incorrectly identified as [[Walt Disney]]. Ravenscroft also narrated the 1969 record ''The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion''. In [[Haunted Mansion (comics)|the comics]], Uncle Theodore narrates ''Doom of the Diva'', the tale of [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Opera Singers|Baronessa Elda]]. In the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] (like in the attraction), Thurl Ravenscroft's likeness was used for one of the singing busts. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone that reads \"In memory of Uncle Theodore\" debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue. In Phantom Manor, his head has not broken off of the bust, but it is leaning over to the side a little, mimicking the broken head in the American mansions and in Tokyo.\n* '''Cousin Algernon''': Distinguishable from the other busts by his derby hat. He was played by Chuck Schroeder. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Cousin Algernon debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Ned Nub''': The only bust without a necktie. He was played by Jay Meyer. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Ned Nub debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n* '''Phineas P. Pock''': The very bust with a necktie. Relative of the poet Prudence Pock. He was played by Bob Ebright. The name Phineas Pock has appeared elsewhere in ''Haunted Mansion'' lore. A tombstone with the name Phineas Pock was featured in the original family plot at Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, but it may not have been the same character as the singing bust. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, an epitaphless tombstone with the name Phineas Pock debuted on the hillside adjacent to the queue.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThey were voiced by the [[Dapper Dans]] in [[The Haunted Mansion (video game)|the video game]] and the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film adaptation]]. However, in these two adaptations, they are reduced to a quartet instead of appearing as five.\n\nIn the [[Wii]] game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', the original five busts make an appearance in a [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Stretching Portrait Characters|stretching portrait]] inside Lonesome Manor. In the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', four of the busts appear in the queue area outside of the Mansion, and can be conducted.\n\nThe Disney animated film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' features an homage during the song ''[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]'', in which the  [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#The Muses|Muses]] appear as singing busts and are arranged in the same way as the ''Haunted Mansion'' characters.\n\n== Hitchhiking Ghosts ==\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are a tongue-in-cheek send-up of [[Vanishing hitchhiker|urban legends involving phantom hitchhikers]]. They are also said to be the attraction's mascots due to their appearances in many merchandise. They have also been known to be the \"funny ghosts\".\n\nNear the end of the ride, the trio are encountered standing together inside a crypt, with thumbs extended. They hitch a ride with guests traveling in Doom Buggies and appear alongside them in mirrors. \"They have selected you to fill our quota, and they'll haunt you until you return\", says the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ghost Host|Ghost Host]]. In 2011 at Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion, the mirror scene was updated with digital effects that enable the ghosts to interact with the guests. The vocals for Walt Disney World's computer-generated ghosts were provided by actor Kurt von Schmittou.\n\nThe Prisoner is a short, hairy little ghost with a ball and chain shackled to his ankle.\n\nThe Skeleton is a tall, dapper, grinning ghost. When the attraction first opened at Disneyland, he was completely bald, but has since had hair of varying lengths. Although the Skeleton figure has the same face mold as the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Hatbox Ghost|Hatbox Ghost]], they are not meant to be the same character. In Marc Davis' original concept art, the character was a stereotypical \"sheet ghost\" with no clothes, save for the [[bowler hat]] he lifted above his head. By the time the attraction opened, the character had evolved into the fully clothed skeletal ghost seen in the Mansion today.\n\nThe Traveler is an overweight [[hunchback]] wearing a [[top hat]] and holding a [[carpet bag]].\n\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts are often referred to as [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Gus|\"Gus\"]] (Prisoner), [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Ezra|\"Ezra\"]] (Skeleton), and \"Phineas\" (Traveler). These names are thought to have originated from and popularised by Cast Members who worked at the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion, and further spread by fans. Since then, the names have appeared on merchandise for the characters and in various media licensed by Disney. When the subject was brought up in a 2006 interview, Imagineer Jason Surrell said, \"Their names are not Ezra, Phineas, and Gus. I don't know where it came from. I know at one point, Cast Members contributed to this website that names all the ghosts and gives them backstories. None of those have any basis in Imagineering story, or anything like that. But somehow Ezra, Phineas, and Gus in particular managed to stick, so in the book about the only thing I could do is acknowledge that and say it's not official, but acknowledge it at the same time.\" When the interactive queue was installed outside of the Walt Disney World attraction in 2011, tombstones with the names Gus and Ezra were added. Also added was a tombstone for [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Phineas Pock|Phineas Pock]], though this is a reference to the [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Singing Busts|singing bust character]], and not the Traveler hitchhiking ghost.\n\n;Appearances in other media\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts make a brief appearance in the [[The Haunted Mansion (2003 film)|2003 film]], passed by the hearse carrying the Evers family through the graveyard, striking their signature pose. As Jim Evers ([[Eddie Murphy]]) is startled by their appearance, the Traveler and Prisoner ''(played by [[Deep Roy]])'' argue how the Evers see them, thinking they are invisible until the Prisoner accuses Jim as a liar and psychic as the Skeleton ''(played by [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]])'' observes silently. Unlike their ride counterparts, the trio were the mansion's former servants; the Traveller was the mansion's head chef (complete with French accent), the Skeleton was the coachman, and the Prisoner was the assistant groundskeeper. Early script drafts for the movie have revealed that the three ghosts were going to play larger comic relief supporting roles, similar to the servant characters Emma and Ezra.\n\nThe characters make an appearance in the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]''.\n\nIn 2012, a [[Disney Dream Portrait Series]] photograph featured the ghosts with, [[Jack Black]] as The Traveller, [[Will Ferrell]] as The Skeleton, and [[Jason Segel]] as The Prisoner. The actor\u2019s makeup was done by Award-Winning makeup artist, [[Matthew W. Mungle]]. \n\nThe Hitchhiking Ghosts made cameo appearances in multiple episodes of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. Most noticeably in the House of Mouse episode \"House Ghosts\", they are freed from a crate by Pete and scare the daylights out of Pete. They also appear in Mickey's House of Villain's where they are freed from a crate by Cruella De Vil and join the villains as they take over the House of Mouse.\n\nIn August 2012, a \"Disney Dream Portrait\" by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] was released, featuring comedic actors [[Jack Black]], [[Will Ferrell]], and [[Jason Segel]] as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n\nThe queue of [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]'' features three Audio-Animatronic hitchhiking droids: a former RX pilot droid and two former F-series droids from the attraction's [[Star Tours|original 1989 incarnation]], all posed in the same manner as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n\nIn 2016, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion \"Ghost Post\" in-park scavenger hunt includes the Phantom Radio iOS app with Disney voice veterans Peter Renaday as Ezra, Dee Bradley Baker as Gus and Stephen Stanton as Phineas.\n\n== Little Leota ==\nAlso known as the 'Ghost Hostess', this miniature \"[[White Lady (ghost)|lady in white]]\" type ghost beckons guests to hurry back at the end of the attraction: \"...be sure to bring your death certificate\" says the Little Leota. She was played (face and voice) by Leota Toombs. The character is said to have been inspired by the \"arrangement hostesses\" from the 1965 film ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]''. The character was conceived as being separate to the character of [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Madame Leota|Madame Leota]], however due to being played by the same woman, both characters are sometimes combined in related media.\n\n== The Dread Family ==\nThe Dread Family is a family of six (five busts, with the twins on one bust together) that killed each other out of greed for their family fortune. Their busts are seen while waiting in line and are a part of interactive queue as a murder mystery for the guests to solve. The members of the Dread family are:\n* Uncle Jacob Dread\n* Bertie Dread\n* Aunt Florence McGriffin Dread\n* The Twins, also known as Wellington and Forsythia Dread\n* Cousin Maude Dread\n\nEach bust includes a cryptogram and a small image to help the guest figure out who killed whom. The cryptograms are as follows:\n\n*Uncle Jacob - \"Greed was the poison he had swallowed. He went first, the others followed. His killer's face he surely knew; now try to discover who killed who.\" \nUncle Jacob met his demise when he was poisoned by Bertie with the venom from his (Bertie's) pet snake.\n*Bertie - \"Avid hunter and expert shot, in the end that's what he got.\" \nBertie was killed with a pistol by Aunt Florence as revenge for killing Jacob.\n*Aunt Florence - \"Never did a dishonorable deed, yet found face down in canary seed.\" \nUnfortunately, when Florence shot Bertie, there was a rogue accident, and the Twins' pet [[Domestic canary|canary]] was shot as well. Out of revenge, the twins killed Florence by suffocating her with a bag of canary seed.\n*Wellington and Forsythia - \"Departed life while in their beds, with identical bumps on identical heads.\" \nThe twins were killed by Cousin Maude when she thumped their heads with a mallet.\n*Cousin Maude - \"Our sleeping beauty, who never awoke, the night her dreams went up in smoke.\"\n \nAs the sole survivor of the Dread family, Maude became the heir to Uncle Jacob's fortune. Unfortunately, Maude had put matches in her bun. When she fell asleep, the friction with her pillow caused a fire; ending the story of the murderous Dread Family.\n\nOn the subject of the conceiving the Dread Family, Pete Carsillo of Walt Disney Imagineering said:\n\"I was proposing a lot of new ghosts, (lion tamers, cowboys, robbers, barons), but I had to construct a story for myself to make the cemetery - particularly an interactive one-make sense. If there are 999 ghosts-as divergent as kings, mummies, minstrels, and even Caesar's ghost-there had to be a larger backstory to explain how the eclectic collection of spirits came to be in one place ... beyond Marty Sklar's famous sign from back in 1963... In play testing, we called them the Dread family, although in the final show, they are not called out by the name Dread. Online they are still referred to as the Dread family, and I don't mind that. It kicks the door open for families other than Gracey to live in the Mansion and creates a lot more possibilities\" The Dread family are the first new characters that guests encounter in the interactive queue of the Florida Mansion.\n\nWhen they were introduced in 2010 as part of the new interactive quene, along with two other family members, Whitifield Tarkington and Ruben, that were cut in the final draft. The family also followed a different backstory, as Jacob died of natural causes, the death order was almost parodoxile and they were on a big stone slab showing most of their full body images. It is unknown Jacob\u2019s cause for death and who killed who first and last, but Ruben killed Forsythia in a fire if you overlook his axe and see the candle, Ruben was killed by Florence with a poisoned dessert that she is seen holding, Florence was killed by Whitifield as he is seen mixing something while holding a syringe, Whitifield was killed by Wellington who is seen holding a slingshot, Wellington was killed by Maude who is seen wrapping something around his neck, Maude was killed by Bertie who is seen with his snake, and Bertie was killed by Forsythia who is seen holding a tea-filled cup and a small bottle. Jacob would be seen separate and has the guests find his fortune he hid, along with the other family members have voice actors and whisper clues to the guests, locating the fortune to be in an urn on the front lawn.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*Surrell, Jason. \u201cA Tour of the Ghostly Retreat.\u201d ''The Haunted Mansion - Imagineering a Disney Classic'', Disney Editions, 2015, pp. 66\u201367. {{ISBN|1484722299}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haunted Mansion Characters}}\n[[Category:Characters of the Disney theme parks]]\n[[Category:Haunted Mansion|Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Disney characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional ghosts]]\n", "name_user": "TimothyJacobson", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing two possible vandalisms", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Haunted_Mansion_characters"}

The starting materials are similar to those used in [[polyurethane]] (PUR) except that the proportion of [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] (MDI) is higher and a [[polyester]]-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a [[polyether]] [[polyol]]. The resulting chemical structure is significantly different, with the [[isocyanate]] groups on the MDI [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimerising]] to form [[isocyanurate]] groups which the polyols link together, giving a complex polymeric structure.\nCyan is blue your insulation is not therefore it is hack\n== Manufacturing ==\n\nThe reaction of MDI and polyol takes place at higher temperatures compared with the reaction temperature for the manufacture of PUR. At these elevated temperatures and in the presence of specific catalysts, MDI will first react with itself, producing a stiff, ring molecule, which is a reactive intermediate (a tri-isocyanate isocyanurate compound). Remaining MDI and the tri-isocyanate react with polyol to form a complex poly(urethane-isocyanurate) polymer (hence the use of the abbreviation PUI as an alternative to PIR), which is foamed in the presence of a suitable blowing agent. This [[isocyanurate]] polymer has a relatively strong molecular structure, because of the combination of strong chemical bonds, the ring structure of isocyanurate and high cross link density, each contributing to the greater stiffness than found in comparable polyurethanes. The greater bond strength also means these are more difficult to break, and as a result a PIR foam is chemically and thermally more stable: breakdown of isocyanurate bonds is reported to start above 200&nbsp;\u00b0C, compared with urethane at 100 to 110&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nPIR typically has an MDI/polyol ratio, also called its index (based on isocyanate/polyol stoichiometry to produce urethane alone), higher than 180.  By comparison PUR indices are normally around 100.  As the index increases material stiffness the brittleness also increases, although the correlation is not linear.  Depending on the product application greater stiffness, chemical and/or thermal stability may be desirable.  As such PIR manufacturers can offer multiple products with identical densities but different indices in an attempt to achieve optimal end use performance.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:PIR Panels 02.JPG|thumb|350 px|Polyisocyanurate insulation boards]]\nPIR is typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation.

Prefabricated PIR sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion-protected, corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of PIR foam and used extensively as roofing insulation and vertical walls (e.g. for warehousing, factories, office buildings etc.).  Other typical uses for PIR foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation, and carving/machining media (competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams).\n\nEffectiveness of the insulation of a building envelope can be compromised by gaps resulting from shrinkage of individual panels.  Manufacturing criteria require that shrinkage be limited to less than 1%{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} (previously 2%{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}).  Even when shrinkage is limited to substantially less than this limit, the resulting gaps around the perimeter of each panel can reduce insulation effectiveness, especially if the panels are assumed to provide a vapor/infiltration barrier.  Multiple layers with staggered joints, ship lapped or tongue & groove joints greatly reduce these problems.\nPolyisocyanurates of isophorone diisocyanate are also been used in the preparation of polyurethane coatings based on acrylic polyols <ref>Gite, V.

His parents were both of [[English people|English]] descent,<ref name=\"GenePress\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/Jeff-Foxworthy.html |title=Jeff Foxworthy Biography (1958-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Foxworthy|title=Surname Database: Foxworthy Last Name Origin|website=The Internet Surname Database}}</ref> with his roots lying in the county of [[Essex]].<ref name=\"GenePress\"/> His grandfather, James Marvin Camp, was a [[Hapeville, Georgia|Hapeville]] firefighter for over three decades.<ref name=GenePress/>\n\nAccording to Foxworthy, who grew up in the [[Southern Baptist]] tradition, he remembers accepting Jesus Christ when he was seven years old. When he told his mother that he wanted to go down to the local sanctuary to accept Christ as his Lord and Savior, his mother, who felt he was too young, told him to wait until he had a firmer understanding of the undertaking. Foxworthy argued with her until a preacher came to their home and vouched for Foxworthy, who went back to the church that night with his mother. Despite this, Foxworthy says that complying with the often-strict rules of the church were difficult for him, saying, \"I love God, but I can't act and dress like that.\u201d\n\nFoxworthy graduated from [[Hapeville High School]]. He attended [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, but left just before graduating.<ref name=\"Redneck Repartee\">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/fall92/redneck.html |title=Redneck Repartee |publisher=Gtalumni.org |accessdate=2010-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519041052/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/fall92/redneck.html |archivedate=2006-05-19 }}</ref> He worked for five years in [[mainframe computer]] maintenance at IBM, where his father also worked.

The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.\n\nIn 2004, he launched a new television series called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB Television Network]], [[Comedy Central]], and Comedy Network (2007). He served as [[executive producer]] and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy's website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005, by WB. Reruns of ''Blue Collar TV'' continued until the network merged with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]. In 2006, Foxworthy resurrected the ''Blue Collar TV'' format on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT) with ''Foxworthy's Big Night Out''. The show began airing in the summer and was canceled after one season.\n\n===Books===\nFoxworthy has authored several books, including ''You Might Be a Redneck If...'' (1989), as well as his autobiography, ''No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!'' (1996). Artist [[Layron DeJarnette]] provided illustrations for the Redneck Dictionary books. R. David Boyd has been the exclusive illustrator for most of Foxworthy's books and album covers.\n\nHe also has released a [[cookbook]] entitled ''The Redneck Grill'', co-authored with [[Newnan, Georgia]], artist R.

When he told his mother that he wanted to go down to the local sanctuary to accept Christ as his Lord and Savior, his mother, who felt he was too young, told him to wait until he had a firmer understanding of the undertaking. Foxworthy argued with her until a preacher came to their home and vouched for Foxworthy, who went back to the church that night with his mother. Despite this, Foxworthy says that complying with the often-strict rules of the church were difficult for him, saying, \"I love God, but I can't act and dress like that.\u201d\n\nFoxworthy graduated from [[Hapeville High School]].

The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.\n\nIn 2004, he launched a new television series called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB Television Network]], [[Comedy Central]], and Comedy Network (2007). He served as [[executive producer]] and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy's website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005, by WB. Reruns of ''Blue Collar TV'' continued until the network merged with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]. In 2006, Foxworthy resurrected the ''Blue Collar TV'' format on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT) with ''Foxworthy's Big Night Out''. The show began airing in the summer and was canceled after one season.\n\n===Books===\nFoxworthy has authored several books, including ''You Might Be a Redneck If...'' (1989), as well as his autobiography, ''No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!'' (1996). Artist [[Layron DeJarnette]] provided illustrations for the Redneck Dictionary books. R. David Boyd has been the exclusive illustrator for most of Foxworthy's books and album covers.\n\nHe also has released a [[cookbook]] entitled ''The Redneck Grill'', co-authored with [[Newnan, Georgia]], artist R.

This was followed by ''Silly Street'' in 2009 and ''Hide!!!'' in 2010, both of which were illustrated by Steve Bjorkman.\n\nIn May 2008, Foxworthy released ''How to Really Stink at Golf'', with co-author Brian Hartt and illustrations by [[Layron DeJarnette]].
