[[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.\n\nIn 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire. He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Gr\u00e9goire de Bl\u00e9simaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 18</ref>  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Netherlands|Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates. Heinrich gave his son a choice\u2014he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious. He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity, which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 56</ref> He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results.

Although it was possible that his death was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.<ref>Safranski (1990), p. 12. \"There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.\"</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 88</ref>  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 4</ref> His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\"/>  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.<ref name=\"autogenerated43\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 90</ref>  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children.

By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]]. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 134</ref> Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 135</ref> Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 21</ref> In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 25</ref> In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits\u2014but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 22</ref>\n\nHe left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen|University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but G\u00f6ttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 140</ref> Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]]. Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 141\u2013144</ref> He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 144</ref> He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810\u201311 and he left G\u00f6ttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 150</ref>). He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\">Cartwright (2010). p. 170</ref> During his days at G\u00f6ttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 151</ref>\n\nHe arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811\u201312.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success. Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.<ref name=\"autogenerated159\">Cartwright (2010). p. 159</ref> He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms<ref name=\"autogenerated159\"/>\u2014seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 165\u2013169</ref> He also attended the lectures of the famous Protestant theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he also quickly came to dislike.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 174</ref> His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very [[Criticism of religion|critical of religion]] and moving towards [[atheism]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 175</ref> He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\"/> He attended philological courses by [[August B\u00f6ckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 171\u2013174</ref>\n\n=== Early work ===\nSchopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 179</ref> He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig M\u00fcller von Gerstenbergk (1778\u20131838), a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 188</ref> He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]]. Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's. Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements\u2014and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence\u2014soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 247\u2013265</ref> Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 256</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Cartwright (2010). p. 265</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 252</ref>\n\nAnother important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer \u2013 a [[historian of religion]], [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] \u2013 who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}}<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 266</ref> Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}} and put them at par with Plato and Kant.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 268</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Cartwright (2010). p. 272</ref> He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 267</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Although he loved [[Hindu texts]] he was more interested in [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=76-77}} which he came to regard as the best religion.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> However, his studies on Hindu and Buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=69}} and the latter were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]].

He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.

Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy.

As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of perception ===\nIn November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}</ref> He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its a priori character\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}</ref>\n\nBy this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\". Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber, \u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L. Rev., 1989</ref> Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].<ref name=\"Young2005\">{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130\u201347|jstor=43469632}}</ref> After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], \"I have not yet spoken my last word about women.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female.

Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n===Intellectual interests and affinities===\n\n====[[Indology]]====\n[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]\n\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321).

In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S.

He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.<ref name=\"Myth of Disenchantment\">{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187\u2013188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual.

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\" /><ref name=\"Presentation\" />\n\nSchopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.

The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.\n\nIn his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans. E. J.

With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.

Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.

At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.

He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref> But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref> His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.<ref name=\"auto5\">Cartwright (2010). p. 506</ref> Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenst\u00e4dt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 507\u2013508</ref> They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 508</ref> He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nIn 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cartwright (2010). p. 514</ref> Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 465</ref> He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] for restoring order.<ref name=\"auto7\">Cartwright (2010). p. 515</ref>  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 517</ref> As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans\u2014and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]]\nIn 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 524</ref> The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.<ref name=\"auto8\">Cartwright (2010). p. 539</ref>  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,<ref name=\"auto9\">Cartwright (2010). pp. 381\u2013386</ref> or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.<ref name=\"auto9\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 537</ref> Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 525</ref> His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 394</ref> and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 510</ref>\n\nAcademic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]\u2019s very critical essay.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 536</ref> Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]] made a first of his four portraits of him\u2014which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like\u2014that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 540</ref> As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining.

Allen & Unwin.</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== The world as representation ===\nSchopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1.

His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\". Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber, \u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour.

He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.</ref> Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta\u1e47h\u0101]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.''

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321).

In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol.

Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3</ref> Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism.

He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.<ref name=\"Myth of Disenchantment\">{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187\u2013188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual.

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists.

It does not include vampires originating in folklore or mythology, or the concept of [[dhampir]]s, hybrid or half-vampires.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Literary==\n<!--*****JUST FOR CHARACTERS FOUND IN BOOKS*****-->\n\n<!--*****\nGuidelines:\n\nPlease post in alphabetical order! Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the telcorresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.\n\nThanks.\n***** -->\n\n===A===\n<!--*****JUST FOR CHARACTERS FOUND IN BOOKS*****-->\n\n{{anchor|Literary A}}\n* Aaron Darnell (''[[Women of the Otherworld]]'')\n* Abby Bennett Wilson (''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'')\n* Addh\u00e9ma ([[Paul F\u00e9val, p\u00e8re|F\u00e9val]]'s ''La Vampire'')\n* [[List of Vampire Academy characters#Adrian Ivashkov|Adrian Ivashkov]] (''[[Vampire Academy]]'')\n* [[The Vampire Chronicles|Akasha]] (''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'')\n* Alan Raby (''[[The Phantom (play)|The Phantom]]'')\n* [[List of Twilight characters#The Volturi|Alec]] (''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series)\n* Alexander Sterling (''[[Vampire Kisses]]'')\n* [[Akivasha]] (books and stories by [[Robert E.

Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the corresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.\n\nThanks.\n***** -->\n\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Role\n! Title\n! Notes\n!

Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the corresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.\n\nThanks.\n***** -->\n\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Role\n! Title\n! Notes\n!

In 1982, it was reorganized by merging with the Bolu Academy of Engineering and Architecture, Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences, the Ankara College of Technical Careers, the Ankara Girls' College of Technical Careers, and the Ankara State Academy of Engineering and Architecture to become a large metropolitan university as part of the act which created the Board of Higher Education. Prior to 1982 when the Board of Higher Education Law came into effect, institutes of higher education in Turkey were organized under different structures as universities, academies, institutes, and schools. In 1992 faculties  and vocational schools in Bolu became [[Abant Izzet Baysal University]].\n\nGazi University comprises 21 faculties, 4 schools, 11 vocational schools of higher education, 52 research centers and 7 graduate institutes. The student enrollment of Gazi University has reached approximately 77,000 in total of whom about 1,500 come from the [[Turkic states]] of [[Central Asia]]. Five thousand students are enrolled in graduate programmes. The total size of the teaching faculty exceeds 3,000 persons.\n\n== Faculties ==\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Arts and Design\n* Faculty of Architecture\n* Faculty of Communication\n* Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Fine Arts\n* Faculty of Health Sciences\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmacy\n* Faculty of Sciences\n* Faculty of Technical Education\n* Faculty of Technology\n* Faculty of Trade and Tourism Education\n* Faculty of Tourism\n* Faculty of Vocational Education\n* Gazi Faculty of Education\n* Industrial Arts Education Faculty\n* Polatl\u0131 Faculty of Arts and Sciences\n\n== Graduate schools ==\n* Graduate School of Educational Sciences\n* Graduate School of Fine Arts\n* Graduate School of Health Sciences\n* Graduate School of Informatics\n* Graduate School of Research and Prevention of Accidents\n* Graduate School of Sciences\n* Graduate School of Social Sciences\n\n== Schools==\n* School of Banking and Insurance\n* School of Foreign Languages\n* School of Land Registry and Cadastre\n* School of Physical Education and Sport\n\n== Vocational schools ==\n* Ankara Vocational School\n* Atat\u00fcrk Vocational School\n* Beypazari Technical Sciences Vocational School\n* Distance Education/Learning Vocational School\n* Gazi Vocational School\n* Ostim Vocational School\n* Polatl\u0131 Vocational School of Social Sciences \n* Vocational School of Health Services \n* Vacational School of Land Registry and Cadastre\n* Vocational School of Law\n* Vocational School of Public Finance\n\n== University governance ==\nThe Rector of Gazi University is Prof. Dr. S\u00fcleyman B\u00fcy\u00fckberber.\n\n==Campuses==\nGazi University is a ''city-university'' which has a multitude of campuses around [[Ankara]], the capital city of Turkey. Its main campus is situated in Be\u015fevler.\n\nThe University's campuses are almost directly inside the city, which makes it easier to find houses to live and centers for shopping, for students. There are many activities at these campuses for students, such as the Spring Festival, free concerts, opening concerts, sports tournaments, theatre performances and performances by student clubs as well as scientific and cultural seminars.\n\n== Gazi University Central Library ==\nGazi University library has 150,000 books, 62,000 bound periodicals, and 10,000 master theses. The library subscribes to 700 periodicals in foreign languages and 600 in Turkish, and provides access to 20,000 on-line journals and 30 on-line databases. Collections are predominantly in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Library orientation programs are organized for new Gazi students.\n\n==Achievements==\n[[Turkey]]'s third face transplant, a partial face transplant, was  performed on March 17, 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year-old woman, at the university's hospital by a team led by surgeon Dr. [[Selahattin \u00d6zmen]]. The patient from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] had lost six years ago her upper jaw including mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity by a firearm accident, and was unable to eat. She had undergone in the past around 35 reconstructative plastic surgery operations.

In 1982, it was reorganized by merging with the Bolu Academy of Engineering and Architecture, Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences, the Ankara College of Technical Careers, the Ankara Girls' College of Technical Careers, and the Ankara State Academy of Engineering and Architecture to become a large metropolitan university as part of the act which created the Board of Higher Education. Prior to 1982 when the Board of Higher Education Law came into effect, institutes of higher education in Turkey were organized under different structures as universities, academies, institutes, and schools. In 1992 faculties  and vocational schools in Bolu became [[Abant Izzet Baysal University]].\n\nGazi University comprises 21 faculties, 4 schools, 11 vocational schools of higher education, 52 research centers and 7 graduate institutes. The student enrollment of Gazi University has reached approximately 77,000 in total of whom about 1,500 come from the [[Turkic states]] of [[Central Asia]]. Five thousand students are enrolled in graduate programmes. The total size of the teaching faculty exceeds 3,000 persons.\n\n== Faculties ==\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Arts and Design\n* Faculty of Architecture\n* Faculty of Communication\n* Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Fine Arts\n* Faculty of Health Sciences\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmacy\n* Faculty of Sciences\n* Faculty of Technical Education\n* Faculty of Technology\n* Faculty of Trade and Tourism Education\n* Faculty of Tourism\n* Faculty of Vocational Education\n* Gazi Faculty of Education\n* Industrial Arts Education Faculty\n* Polatl\u0131 Faculty of Arts and Sciences\n\n== Graduate schools ==\n* Graduate School of Educational Sciences\n* Graduate School of Fine Arts\n* Graduate School of Health Sciences\n* Graduate School of Informatics\n* Graduate School of Research and Prevention of Accidents\n* Graduate School of Sciences\n* Graduate School of Social Sciences\n\n== Schools==\n* School of Banking and Insurance\n* School of Foreign Languages\n* School of Land Registry and Cadastre\n* School of Physical Education and Sport\n\n== Vocational schools ==\n* Ankara Vocational School\n* Atat\u00fcrk Vocational School\n* Beypazari Technical Sciences Vocational School\n* Distance Education/Learning Vocational School\n* Gazi Vocational School\n* Ostim Vocational School\n* Polatl\u0131 Vocational School of Social Sciences \n* Vocational School of Health Services \n* Vacational School of Land Registry and Cadastre\n* Vocational School of Law\n* Vocational School of Public Finance\n\n== University governance ==\nThe Rector of Gazi University is Prof. Dr. S\u00fcleyman B\u00fcy\u00fckberber.\n\n==Campuses==\nGazi University is a ''city-university'' which has a multitude of campuses around [[Ankara]], the capital city of Turkey. Its main campus is situated in Be\u015fevler.\n\nThe University's campuses are almost directly inside the city, which makes it easier to find houses to live and centers for shopping, for students. There are many activities at these campuses for students, such as the Spring Festival, free concerts, opening concerts, sports tournaments, theatre performances and performances by student clubs as well as scientific and cultural seminars.\n\n== Gazi University Central Library ==\nGazi University library has 150,000 books, 62,000 bound periodicals, and 10,000 master theses. The library subscribes to 700 periodicals in foreign languages and 600 in Turkish, and provides access to 20,000 on-line journals and 30 on-line databases. Collections are predominantly in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Library orientation programs are organized for new Gazi students.\n\n==Achievements==\n[[Turkey]]'s third face transplant, a partial face transplant, was  performed on March 17, 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year-old woman, at the university's hospital by a team led by surgeon Dr. [[Selahattin \u00d6zmen]]. The patient from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] had lost six years ago her upper jaw including mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity by a firearm accident, and was unable to eat. She had undergone in the past around 35 reconstructative plastic surgery operations. The donor was a 28-year-old woman in [[Istanbul]], who committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2012/03/23/gazi-yuz-naklini-damardan-bagladi |newspaper=[[Sabah (Newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Gazi, y\u00fcz naklini 'damardan' ba\u011flad\u0131 |author=Cant\u00fcrk, Safure |date=2012-03-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1260147&title=ucuncu-yuz-nakli-gazi-universitesi-tip-fakultesi-hastanesinde-basladi |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |title=\u00dc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fc y\u00fcz nakli Gazi \u00dcniversitesi T\u0131p Fak\u00fcltesi Hastanesi'nde ba\u015flad\u0131 |date=2012-03-17 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319141259/http://zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1260147&title=ucuncu-yuz-nakli-gazi-universitesi-tip-fakultesi-hastanesinde-basladi |archivedate=2012-03-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25331432/ |newspaper=NTV MSNBC |title=\u00dc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fc y\u00fcz nakli bir kad\u0131na  |date=2012-03-17 |language=Turkish|accessdate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n\n===Alumni (including graduates of former colleges)===\n* [[Ferman Akg\u00fcl]] - Songwriter and singer\n* [[\u0130nci Aral]] - Writer (short-story)\n* [[Sinan Ayg\u00fcn]] - Chairman of Ankara Trade Chamber\n* [[Fakir Baykurt]] - Novelist\n* [[\u0130lhan Berk]] - Poet, writer\n* [[B\u00fclent Bezd\u00fcd]] - Musician with Grammy Awards\n* [[Mehmet Zafer \u00c7a\u011flayan]] - Minister for Trade and Industry\n* [[Tar\u0131k Da\u015fg\u00fcn]] - [[Turkey|Turkish]] professional football coach and former [[association football|footballer]]\n* [[Melih G\u00f6k\u00e7ek]] - Mayor of Ankara Metropolitan Municipality\n* [[Kemal G\u00f6z\u00fckara]] - Mathematician, Businessman, Benifactor and President of the Istanbul Arel University\n* [[Abbas G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc]] - Pedagogist, journalist with a popular TV program for students\n* [[Biket \u0130lhan]] - Film director\n* [[\u00d6zdemir \u0130nce]] - Poet, writer, member of [[European Poetry Academy]]\n* [[Handan \u0130pek\u00e7i]] - Screenwriter and film director\n* [[Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu]] - Politician, Chairman of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]]\n* [[Halil Mutlu]] - Olympic gold medalist and world champion weightlifter\n* [[Nihat \u00d6zdemir]] - Businessman, deputy chairman of [[Fenerbah\u00e7e Sports Club]]\n* [[Metin \u015eahin]] - European taekwondo champion and current president of [[Turkish Taekwondo Federation]]\n* [[Sinan \u015eamil Sam]] - Professional boxer\n* [[Zeki Sezer]] - Politician, former chairman of [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]]\n* [[Naim S\u00fcleymano\u011flu]] - Olympic gold medalist and world champion weightlifter\n* [[Nurcan Taylan]] - Olympic gold medalist and world champion female weightlifter\n* [[Kemal Unak\u0131tan]] - Former Minister of Finance\n* [[Hamza Yerlikaya]] - Olympic gold medalist and world champion wrestler\n* [[Devlet Bah\u00e7eli]] - Politician, Chairman of Nationalist Movement Party (Turkey)(MHP)\n* [[Esra K\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc]] - National female cyclist\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of universities in Ankara]]\n* [[List of universities in Turkey]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|URL=http://gazi-universitesi.gazi.edu.tr/?language=en_US|Gazi University official website}}\n* [http://www.lib.gazi.edu.tr Gazi Central Library] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [http://www.vakif.gazi.edu.tr Gazi University Foundation] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [http://www.tomer.gazi.edu.tr Gazi University Center for Turkish Teaching] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720122256/http://www.yadem.gazi.edu.tr/ Gazi University Center for Foreign Language Teaching] \n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061108060810/http://www.gazimezunlar.org.tr/ Gazi University Alumni Organization] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100217033740/http://www.radyo.gazi.edu.tr/ Radio Gazi Fm] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [http://www.mf.gazi.edu.tr Gazi University Faculty of Engineering] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [http://www.mim.gazi.edu.tr Gazi University Faculty of Architecture] {{in lang|tr}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230050/http://www.iibf.gazi.edu.tr/ Gazi University Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences] {{in lang|tr}}\n\n{{Universities and colleges in Ankara}}\n{{Universities in Turkey}}\n\n{{coord|39|56|12|N|32|49|20|E|region:TR-06_type:edu_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Gazi University|*]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1926]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Ankara]]\n[[Category:Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Benifactor->Benefactor -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazi_University"}

One part of the leaf, the trophophore, is sterile and fernlike; the other, the [[sporophore]], is fertile and carries the clusters of sporangia or spore cases.

While some Botrychium species are quite rare, conservation efforts can be difficult.  Determining the rarity of a species is complicated by the plants\u2019 small leaves, which stand only 2-10 centimeters above the soil.<ref name=\"Johnson-Groh2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson-Groh | first1 = C. L. | last2 = Lee | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Phenology and demography of two species of Botrychium (Ophioglassaceae) | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 89 | issue = 10| pages = 1624\u20131633 }}</ref>  Even more of a challenge in obtaining an accurate population count is the genus\u2019s largely subterranean life cycle.  The vast majority of any one population of moonworts actually exists below ground in banks consisting of several types of propagules.  One type of propagule is the ungerminated spores, which must percolate through the soil beyond the reach of light in order to germinate.  This presumably increases the probability that the spore will be in range of a mycorrhizal symbiont before it produces the tiny, roughly heart-shaped gametophyte, which also exists entirely below ground.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Whittier | first1 = D | year = 1973 | title = The effect of light and other factors on spore germination in Botrychium dissectum | url = | journal = Can J Bot | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 1791\u20131794 }}</ref>  Finally, some species produce gemmae, a form of asexual propagation achieved by budding of the root.<ref name=\"Johnson-Groh2002\" />\n\nJuvenile and dormant [[sporophyte]]s can also be hidden in the soil for long periods of time.  Mature sporophytes do not necessarily produce a leaf annually; they can remain viable underground for up to 10 years without putting up a photosynthetic component.  This feat is made possible by their dependence on symbiotic partnership with AM fungi of the genus Glomus, which supply most fixed carbon for growth and reproduction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Winther | first1 = J | last2 = Friedman | first2 = W | year = 2007 | title = Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts in Botrychium (Ophioglossaceae) | url = | journal = Am J Bot | volume = 94 | issue = 7| pages = 1248\u20131255 }}</ref>\n\nThis mycorrhizal dependence has also made lab cultivation of moonworts difficult.  Thus far, only germination of the gametophyte has been successful.\n\n<!-- \nThe only British species is the ''Botrychium lunaria'' ('moonwort'), a little plant pretty frequent in dry mountain pastures.

While some Botrychium species are quite rare, conservation efforts can be difficult.  Determining the rarity of a species is complicated by the plants\u2019 small leaves, which stand only 2-10 centimeters above the soil.<ref name=\"Johnson-Groh2002\">Johnson-Groh, C. L. and J. Lee (2002).  \u201cPhenology and demography of two species of Botrychium (Ophioglassaceae)\u201d.  ''American Journal of Botany''  89 (10): 1624-1633.</ref>  Even more of a challenge in obtaining an accurate population count is the genus\u2019s largely subterranean life cycle.  The vast majority of any one population of moonworts actually exists below ground in banks consisting of several types of propagules.  One type of propagule is the ungerminated spores, which must percolate through the soil beyond the reach of light in order to germinate.  This presumably increases the probability that the spore will be in range of a mycorrhizal symbiont before it produces the tiny, roughly heart-shaped gametophyte, which also exists entirely below ground.<ref>Whittier D (1973).  \u201cThe effect of light and other factors on spore germination in Botrychium dissectum\u201d.  Can J Bot 51: 1791-1794.</ref>  Finally, some species produce gemmae, a form of asexual propagation achieved by budding of the root.<ref name=\"Johnson-Groh2002\" />\n\nJuvenile and dormant [[sporophyte]]s can also be hidden in the soil for long periods of time.  Mature sporophytes do not necessarily produce a leaf annually; they can remain viable underground for up to 10 years without putting up a photosynthetic component.  This feat is made possible by their dependence on symbiotic partnership with AM fungi of the genus Glomus, which supply most fixed carbon for growth and reproduction.<ref>Winther J, Friedman W (2007).  \u201cArbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts in Botrychium (Ophioglossaceae)\u201d. Am J Bot 94 (7): 1248-1255.</ref>\n\nThis mycorrhizal dependence has also made lab cultivation of moonworts difficult.

The resulting album, ''Vs.'', featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and its first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]].\n\nPearl Jam decided to scale back its promotional efforts for ''Vs.'', including declining to produce music videos for any of the album's singles. Upon its release, ''Vs.'' set the record for most copies of an album sold during its first week, a record it held for five years. ''Vs.'' occupied the number one spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|seven times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.\n\n==Recording==\nFor its second album, Pearl Jam felt the pressure of trying to match the success of its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''.

Rehearsals for ''Vs.'' began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band then moved to The Site in [[Nicasio, California|Nicasio]], [[California]] in March 1993 to begin recording.

According to Ament, the cover was a representation of how the band felt at the time, with Ament stating \"we were slaves\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The album booklet contains additional drawings and writings by Vedder, including one page apparently [[doodle]]d at a business meeting that says \"I will never trust anybody again.\"<ref name=\"thenewyorktimes\"/> The lyric page for \"W.M.A.\" features a portion of a news story concerning [[Malice Green]], a victim of [[police brutality]].\n\nOriginally, the album was titled ''Five Against One'' (The song \"Animal\" features the lyric \"One, two, three, four, five against one&nbsp;...\"). Concerning the original album title, Gossard said, \"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record&nbsp;... Your own independence\u2014your own soul\u2014versus everybody else's.\"<ref name=\"fiveagainst\"/> The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to ''Vs.'', a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title ''Vs.'', Vedder said, \"They were writing all these articles&nbsp;... Our band against somebody else's band. What the hell are they talking about? You know, don't try to separate the powers that be. We're all in this together.\"<ref>Vedder, Eddie. \"Rockline Interview\". [[KISW|KISW-FM]], Seattle, Washington.

The resulting album, ''Vs.'', featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and its first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]].\n\nPearl Jam decided to scale back its promotional efforts for ''Vs.'', including declining to produce music videos for any of the album's singles. Upon its release, ''Vs.'' set the record for most copies of an album sold during its first week, a record it held for five years. ''Vs.'' occupied the number one spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|seven times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.\n\n==Recording==\nFor its second album, Pearl Jam felt the pressure of trying to match the success of its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. In a 2002 interview, guitarist [[Mike McCready]] said, \"The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.\"<ref name=\"totalguitar\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> ''Vs.'' was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. It was also the band's first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]], who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album ''Ten''. Rehearsals for ''Vs.'' began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band then moved to The Site in [[Nicasio, California|Nicasio]], [[California]] in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site \"paradise\" while lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] said, \"I fucking hate it here&nbsp;... I've had a hard time&nbsp;...

According to Ament, the cover was a representation of how the band felt at the time, with Ament stating \"we were slaves\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The album booklet contains additional drawings and writings by Vedder, including one page apparently [[doodle]]d at a business meeting that says \"I will never trust anybody again.\"<ref name=\"thenewyorktimes\"/> The lyric page for \"W.M.A.\" features a portion of a news story concerning [[Malice Green]], a victim of [[police brutality]].\n\nOriginally, the album was titled ''Five Against One'' (The song \"Animal\" features the lyric \"One, two, three, four, five against one&nbsp;...\"). Concerning the original album title, Gossard said, \"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record&nbsp;... Your own independence\u2014your own soul\u2014versus everybody else's.\"<ref name=\"fiveagainst\"/> The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to ''Vs.'', a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title ''Vs.'', Vedder said, \"They were writing all these articles&nbsp;... Our band against somebody else's band. What the hell are they talking about? You know, don't try to separate the powers that be. We're all in this together.\"<ref>Vedder, Eddie. \"Rockline Interview\". [[KISW|KISW-FM]], Seattle, Washington. October 18, 1993.</ref>\n\nThe decision to change the album's name at the last minute resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title.

Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour to the touring habits of [[Led Zeppelin]], in that the band \"ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans\". During this tour the band set a cap on ticket prices in the attempt to thwart [[Ticket resale|scalpers]].<ref>DeRogatis, Jim.

The two families of Bennettitales (Cycadeoidaceae and Williamsoniaceae) each have their own unique traits. Cycadeoidaceae had stout trunks and bisporangiate [[Conifer cone|strobili]] (cones) serving as their [[Sexual reproduction|reproductive]] structures and Williamsoniaceae either had bisporangiate or monosporangiate cones, and distinctly slender and branching woody trunks.<ref name=\":1\" /> These bisporangiate cones consist of layers of protective [[bract]]s, a curved [[microsporophyll]], and an ovulate [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].<ref>Arens, Nan C.; Stromberg, C; Thompson, A. \"Introduction to the Bennettitales\". Retrieved April 16, 2018.</ref> The bisporangiate cones remained closed at maturation, and most likely were obligate self-fertilizers.<ref>Osborn, Jeffrey M.; Taylor, Mackenzie (2010).

To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is \"killed\" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear dark green business suits with matching neckties, white dress shirts, and sunglasses with rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie'' (2017)===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\nFrench actor [[Jean Reno]] was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in ''The Matrix'', but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he didn't want to leave his native [[France]], unwilling to move to [[Australia]] for a four-and-a-half months shooting.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\". He calls him \"Neo\" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.\n\nWeaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as \"more of a free agent\" later on in the series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nChristopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character \"had all the good lines\", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing \"refreshingly nihilistic wit\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}</ref>\n\nThe character has been described as a 1950s \"organization man\", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}</ref>\n\nAs a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Men in black]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|The Matrix}}\n\n{{Matrix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Agent}}\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computer viruses]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Matrix (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Advertising characters]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]] \n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = black\n| name        = Agent Smith\n| series      = [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]\n| image       = Agent Smith (The Matrix series character).jpg\n| image_size  = \n| caption     = Hugo Weaving portraying Agent Smith\n| first       = ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)\n| last               = ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017)\n| creator     = [[The Wachowskis]]\n| portrayer   = [[Hugo Weaving]]<br>[[Ian Bliss]] {{small|(human form)}}\n| voice       = [[Christopher Corey Smith]]\n| nickname    = \n| alias       = \n| species     = Computer program (formerly), Virus, Human (while possessing Bane) \n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]], later [[computer virus|virus]]\n| title       = \n| family      = \n| spouse      = \n| children    = \n| relatives   = \n| religion    = \n| nationality = \n}}\n\n'''Agent Smith''' is a fictional character and the main [[antagonist]] of [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]].

To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is \"killed\" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear dark green business suits with matching neckties, white dress shirts, and sunglasses with rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie'' (2017)===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\nFrench actor [[Jean Reno]] was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in ''The Matrix'', but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he didn't want to leave his native [[France]], unwilling to move to [[Australia]] for a four-and-a-half months shooting.

He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\". He calls him \"Neo\" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.\n\nWeaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as \"more of a free agent\" later on in the series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nChristopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character \"had all the good lines\", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing \"refreshingly nihilistic wit\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}</ref>\n\nThe character has been described as a 1950s \"organization man\", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}</ref>\n\nAs a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Men in black]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|The Matrix}}\n\n{{Matrix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Agent}}\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computer viruses]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Matrix (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Advertising characters]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]] \n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "name_user": "82.26.244.66", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content and fixed error)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Smith"}
{"title_page": "Normed vector space", "text_new": "[[File:Mathematical Spaces.png|thumb|250px|Hierarchy of mathematical spaces. Normed vector spaces are a subset of metric spaces and a superset of inner product spaces.]]\n\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''normed vector space''' is a [[vector space]] on which a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is defined. A norm is the formalization and the generalization to real vector spaces of the intuitive notion of \"length\" in the real world. A norm is a [[real-valued function]] defined on the vector space that has the following properties:\n\n# The zero vector, '''0''', has zero length; every other vector has a positive length.\n#: <math>\\|x\\|\\geq 0</math>, and <math>\\|x\\|= 0</math> if and only if <math>x=0</math>\n# Multiplying a vector by a positive number changes its length without changing its direction. Moreover,<br />\n#: <math>\\|\\alpha x\\|=|\\alpha| \\|x\\|</math> for any scalar <math>\\alpha.</math>\n# The [[triangle inequality]] holds.

(triangle inequality)\n\nThe generalization of these three properties to more abstract vector spaces leads to the notion of norm. A vector space on which a norm is defined is then called a '''normed space''' or '''normed vector space'''.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite book |first=Frank M. |last=Callier |title=Linear System Theory |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1991 |isbn=0-387-97573-X }}</ref>\nNormed vector spaces are central to the study of [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]].\n\n==Definition==\nA '''normed vector space''' is a pair <math>(V, \\|\\cdot\\| )</math> where <math>V</math> is a [[vector space]] and <math>\\|\\cdot\\|</math> a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on <math>V</math>.\n\nA '''seminormed vector space''' is a [[n-tuple|pair]] <math>(V,p)</math> where <math>V</math> is a vector space and <math>p</math> a [[norm (mathematics)|seminorm]] on <math>V</math>.\n\nWe often omit <math>p</math> or <math>\\|\\cdot\\|</math> and just write <math>V</math> for a space if it is clear from the context what (semi) norm we are using.\n\nIn a more general sense, a vector norm can be taken to be any real-valued function{{clarify|date=January 2018}} that satisfies the three properties above.\n\nA useful [[Triangle_inequality#Reverse_triangle_inequality|variation of the triangle inequality]] is\n:<math>\\|x-y\\| \\ge | \\|x\\|-\\|y\\| |</math> for any vectors x and y.\n\nThis also shows that a vector norm is a [[continuous function]].\n\nNote that property 2 depends on a choice of norm <math>|\\alpha|</math> on the field of scalars. When the scalar field is <math>\\mathbb R</math> (or more generally a subset of <math>\\mathbb C</math>), this is usually taken to be the ordinary [[absolute value]], but other choices are possible. For example, for a vector space over <math>\\mathbb Q</math> one could take <math>|\\alpha|</math> to be the [[p-adic order|''p''-adic norm]], which gives rise to a different class of normed vector spaces.\n\n==Topological structure==\nIf (''V'', \u2016\u00b7\u2016) is a normed vector space, the norm \u2016\u00b7\u2016 induces a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (a notion of ''distance'') and therefore a [[topology]] on ''V''. This metric is defined in the natural way: the distance between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' is given by \u2016'''u'''\u2212'''v'''\u2016. This topology is precisely the weakest topology which makes \u2016\u00b7\u2016 continuous and which is compatible with the linear structure of ''V'' in the following sense:\n\n#The vector addition + : ''V'' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the [[triangle inequality]].\n#The scalar multiplication \u00b7 : '''K''' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''V'', where '''K''' is the underlying scalar field of ''V'', is jointly continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.\n\nSimilarly, for any semi-normed vector space we can define the distance between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' as \u2016'''u'''\u2212'''v'''\u2016. This turns the seminormed space into a [[pseudometric space]] (notice this is weaker than a metric) and allows the definition of notions such as [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]] and [[limit of a function|convergence]].\nTo put it more abstractly every semi-normed vector space is a [[topological vector space]] and thus carries a [[topological structure]] which is induced by the semi-norm.\n\nOf special interest are [[complete space|complete]] normed spaces called [[Banach space]]s. Every normed vector space ''V'' sits as a dense subspace inside a Banach space; this Banach space is essentially uniquely defined by ''V'' and is called the ''[[Cauchy completion|completion]]'' of ''V''.\n\nAll norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent from a topological viewpoint as they induce the same topology (although the resulting metric spaces need not be the same).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Kedlaya | first1=Kiran S. | author1-link=Kiran Kedlaya  | title=''p''-adic differential equations | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | isbn=978-0-521-76879-5 | year=2010 | volume=125| citeseerx=10.1.1.165.270 }}, Theorem 1.3.6</ref> And since any Euclidean space is complete, we can thus conclude that all finite-dimensional normed vector spaces are Banach spaces. A normed vector space ''V'' is [[locally compact]] if and only if the unit ball ''B'' = {''x'' : \u2016''x''\u2016 \u2264 1} is [[Compact space|compact]], which is the case if and only if ''V'' is finite-dimensional; this is a consequence of [[Riesz's lemma]].  (In fact, a more general result is true: a topological vector space is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional.\nThe point here is that we don't assume the topology comes from a norm.)\n\nThe topology of a seminormed vector space has many nice properties. Given a [[neighbourhood system]] <math>\\mathcal{N}(0)</math> around 0 we can construct all other neighbourhood systems as\n:<math>\\mathcal{N}(x)= x + \\mathcal{N}(0) := \\{x + N \\mid N \\in \\mathcal{N}(0) \\}</math>\nwith\n:<math>x + N := \\{x + n \\mid n \\in N \\}</math>.\n\nMoreover there exists a [[neighbourhood basis]] for 0 consisting of [[absorbing set|absorbing]] and [[convex set]]s. As this property is very useful in [[functional analysis]], generalizations of normed vector spaces with this property are studied under the name [[locally convex spaces]].\n\n==Linear maps and dual spaces==\nThe most important maps between two normed vector spaces are the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear maps]]. Together with these maps, normed vector spaces form a [[category theory|category]].\n\nThe norm is a continuous function on its vector space.  All linear maps between finite dimensional vector spaces are also continuous.\n\nAn ''isometry'' between two normed vector spaces is a linear map ''f'' which preserves the norm (meaning \u2016''f''('''v''')\u2016 = \u2016'''v'''\u2016 for all vectors '''v'''). Isometries are always continuous and [[injective]]. A [[surjective]] isometry between the normed vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is called an ''isometric isomorphism'', and ''V'' and ''W'' are called ''isometrically isomorphic''. Isometrically isomorphic normed vector spaces are identical for all practical purposes.\n\nWhen speaking of normed vector spaces, we augment the notion of [[dual space]] to take the norm into account. The dual ''V''&nbsp;' of a normed vector space ''V'' is the space of all ''continuous'' linear maps from ''V'' to the base field (the complexes or the reals) \u2014 such linear maps are called \"functionals\".  The norm of a functional \u03c6 is defined as the [[supremum]] of |\u03c6('''v''')| where '''v''' ranges over all unit vectors (i.e. vectors of norm 1) in ''V''. This turns ''V''&nbsp;' into a normed vector space. An important theorem about continuous linear functionals on normed vector spaces is the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]].\n\n==Normed spaces as quotient spaces of seminormed spaces==\nThe definition of many normed spaces (in particular, [[Banach space]]s) involves a seminorm defined on a vector space and then the normed space is defined as the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] by the subspace of elements of seminorm zero.  For instance, with the [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]], the function defined by\n:<math>\\|f\\|_p = \\left( \\int |f(x)|^p \\;dx \\right)^{1/p}</math>\nis a seminorm on the vector space of all functions on which the [[Lebesgue integral]] on the right hand side is defined and finite.  However, the seminorm is equal to zero for any function [[Support (mathematics)|supported]] on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.  These functions form a subspace which we \"quotient out\", making them equivalent to the zero function.\n\n==Finite product spaces==\nGiven ''n'' seminormed spaces ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> with seminorms ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> we can define the [[product space]] as\n:<math>X := \\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i</math>\nwith vector addition defined as\n:<math>(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)+(y_1,\\ldots,y_n):=(x_1 + y_1, \\ldots, x_n + y_n)</math>\nand scalar multiplication defined as\n:<math>\\alpha(x_1,\\ldots,x_n):=(\\alpha x_1, \\ldots, \\alpha x_n)</math>.\n\nWe define a new function ''q''\n:<math>q:X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>\nfor example as\n:<math>q:(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\mapsto \\sum_{i=1}^n q_i(x_i)</math>.\nwhich is a seminorm on ''X''. The function ''q'' is a norm if and only if all ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> are norms.\n\nMore generally, for each real ''p''\u22651 we have the seminorm:\n:<math>q:(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\mapsto \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n q_i(x_i)^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p}.</math>\n\nFor each p this defines the same topological space.\n\nA straightforward argument involving elementary linear algebra shows that the only finite-dimensional seminormed spaces are those arising as the product space of a normed space and a space with trivial seminorm.  Consequently, many of the more interesting examples and applications of seminormed spaces occur for infinite-dimensional vector spaces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Locally convex topological vector space|Locally convex space]], generalizations of seminormed vector spaces\n*[[Banach space]], normed vector spaces which are complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm\n*[[Inner product space]], normed vector spaces where the norm is given by an [[inner product]]\n*[[Finsler manifold]], where the length of each tangent vector is determined by a norm\n*[[Space (mathematics)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{Citation | title=Functional analysis and control theory: Linear systems|last=Rolewicz |first=Stefan|year=1987| isbn=90-277-2186-6| publisher=D.

A vector space on which a norm is defined is then called a '''normed space''' or '''normed vector space'''.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite book |first=Frank M. |last=Callier |title=Linear System Theory |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1991 |isbn=0-387-97573-X }}</ref>\nNormed vector spaces are central to the study of [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]].\n\n==Definition==\nA '''normed vector space''' is a pair <math>(V, \\|\\cdot\\| )</math> where <math>V</math> is a [[vector space]] and <math>\\|\\cdot\\|</math> a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on <math>V</math>.\n\nA '''seminormed vector space''' is a [[n-tuple|pair]] <math>(V,p)</math> where <math>V</math> is a vector space and <math>p</math> a [[norm (mathematics)|seminorm]] on <math>V</math>.\n\nWe often omit <math>p</math> or <math>\\|\\cdot\\|</math> and just write <math>V</math> for a space if it is clear from the context what (semi) norm we are using.\n\nIn a more general sense, a vector norm can be taken to be any real-valued function{{clarify|date=January 2018}} that satisfies the three properties above.\n\nA useful [[Triangle_inequality#Reverse_triangle_inequality|variation of the triangle inequality]] is\n:<math>\\|x-y\\| \\ge | \\|x\\|-\\|y\\| |</math> for any vectors x and y.\n\nThis also shows that a vector norm is a [[continuous function]].\n\nNote that property 2 depends on a choice of norm <math>|\\alpha|</math> on the field of scalars. When the scalar field is <math>\\mathbb R</math> (or more generally a subset of <math>\\mathbb C</math>), this is usually taken to be the ordinary absolute value, but other choices are possible. For example, for a vector space over <math>\\mathbb Q</math> one could take <math>|\\alpha|</math> to be the [[p-adic order|''p''-adic norm]], which gives rise to a different class of normed vector spaces.\n\n==Topological structure==\nIf (''V'', \u2016\u00b7\u2016) is a normed vector space, the norm \u2016\u00b7\u2016 induces a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (a notion of ''distance'') and therefore a [[topology]] on ''V''. This metric is defined in the natural way: the distance between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' is given by \u2016'''u'''\u2212'''v'''\u2016. This topology is precisely the weakest topology which makes \u2016\u00b7\u2016 continuous and which is compatible with the linear structure of ''V'' in the following sense:\n\n#The vector addition + : ''V'' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''V'' is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the [[triangle inequality]].\n#The scalar multiplication \u00b7 : '''K''' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''V'', where '''K''' is the underlying scalar field of ''V'', is jointly continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.\n\nSimilarly, for any semi-normed vector space we can define the distance between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' as \u2016'''u'''\u2212'''v'''\u2016. This turns the seminormed space into a [[pseudometric space]] (notice this is weaker than a metric) and allows the definition of notions such as [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]] and [[limit of a function|convergence]].\nTo put it more abstractly every semi-normed vector space is a [[topological vector space]] and thus carries a [[topological structure]] which is induced by the semi-norm.\n\nOf special interest are [[complete space|complete]] normed spaces called [[Banach space]]s. Every normed vector space ''V'' sits as a dense subspace inside a Banach space; this Banach space is essentially uniquely defined by ''V'' and is called the ''[[Cauchy completion|completion]]'' of ''V''.\n\nAll norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent from a topological viewpoint as they induce the same topology (although the resulting metric spaces need not be the same).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Kedlaya | first1=Kiran S. | author1-link=Kiran Kedlaya  | title=''p''-adic differential equations | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | isbn=978-0-521-76879-5 | year=2010 | volume=125| citeseerx=10.1.1.165.270 }}, Theorem 1.3.6</ref> And since any Euclidean space is complete, we can thus conclude that all finite-dimensional normed vector spaces are Banach spaces. A normed vector space ''V'' is [[locally compact]] if and only if the unit ball ''B'' = {''x'' : \u2016''x''\u2016 \u2264 1} is [[Compact space|compact]], which is the case if and only if ''V'' is finite-dimensional; this is a consequence of [[Riesz's lemma]].  (In fact, a more general result is true: a topological vector space is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional.\nThe point here is that we don't assume the topology comes from a norm.)\n\nThe topology of a seminormed vector space has many nice properties. Given a [[neighbourhood system]] <math>\\mathcal{N}(0)</math> around 0 we can construct all other neighbourhood systems as\n:<math>\\mathcal{N}(x)= x + \\mathcal{N}(0) := \\{x + N \\mid N \\in \\mathcal{N}(0) \\}</math>\nwith\n:<math>x + N := \\{x + n \\mid n \\in N \\}</math>.\n\nMoreover there exists a [[neighbourhood basis]] for 0 consisting of [[absorbing set|absorbing]] and [[convex set]]s. As this property is very useful in [[functional analysis]], generalizations of normed vector spaces with this property are studied under the name [[locally convex spaces]].\n\n==Linear maps and dual spaces==\nThe most important maps between two normed vector spaces are the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear maps]]. Together with these maps, normed vector spaces form a [[category theory|category]].\n\nThe norm is a continuous function on its vector space.  All linear maps between finite dimensional vector spaces are also continuous.\n\nAn ''isometry'' between two normed vector spaces is a linear map ''f'' which preserves the norm (meaning \u2016''f''('''v''')\u2016 = \u2016'''v'''\u2016 for all vectors '''v'''). Isometries are always continuous and [[injective]]. A [[surjective]] isometry between the normed vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is called an ''isometric isomorphism'', and ''V'' and ''W'' are called ''isometrically isomorphic''. Isometrically isomorphic normed vector spaces are identical for all practical purposes.\n\nWhen speaking of normed vector spaces, we augment the notion of [[dual space]] to take the norm into account. The dual ''V''&nbsp;' of a normed vector space ''V'' is the space of all ''continuous'' linear maps from ''V'' to the base field (the complexes or the reals) \u2014 such linear maps are called \"functionals\".  The norm of a functional \u03c6 is defined as the [[supremum]] of |\u03c6('''v''')| where '''v''' ranges over all unit vectors (i.e. vectors of norm 1) in ''V''. This turns ''V''&nbsp;' into a normed vector space. An important theorem about continuous linear functionals on normed vector spaces is the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]].\n\n==Normed spaces as quotient spaces of seminormed spaces==\nThe definition of many normed spaces (in particular, [[Banach space]]s) involves a seminorm defined on a vector space and then the normed space is defined as the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] by the subspace of elements of seminorm zero.  For instance, with the [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]], the function defined by\n:<math>\\|f\\|_p = \\left( \\int |f(x)|^p \\;dx \\right)^{1/p}</math>\nis a seminorm on the vector space of all functions on which the [[Lebesgue integral]] on the right hand side is defined and finite.  However, the seminorm is equal to zero for any function [[Support (mathematics)|supported]] on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.  These functions form a subspace which we \"quotient out\", making them equivalent to the zero function.\n\n==Finite product spaces==\nGiven ''n'' seminormed spaces ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> with seminorms ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> we can define the [[product space]] as\n:<math>X := \\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i</math>\nwith vector addition defined as\n:<math>(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)+(y_1,\\ldots,y_n):=(x_1 + y_1, \\ldots, x_n + y_n)</math>\nand scalar multiplication defined as\n:<math>\\alpha(x_1,\\ldots,x_n):=(\\alpha x_1, \\ldots, \\alpha x_n)</math>.\n\nWe define a new function ''q''\n:<math>q:X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>\nfor example as\n:<math>q:(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\mapsto \\sum_{i=1}^n q_i(x_i)</math>.\nwhich is a seminorm on ''X''. The function ''q'' is a norm if and only if all ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> are norms.\n\nMore generally, for each real ''p''\u22651 we have the seminorm:\n:<math>q:(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\mapsto \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n q_i(x_i)^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p}.</math>\n\nFor each p this defines the same topological space.\n\nA straightforward argument involving elementary linear algebra shows that the only finite-dimensional seminormed spaces are those arising as the product space of a normed space and a space with trivial seminorm.  Consequently, many of the more interesting examples and applications of seminormed spaces occur for infinite-dimensional vector spaces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Locally convex topological vector space|Locally convex space]], generalizations of seminormed vector spaces\n*[[Banach space]], normed vector spaces which are complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm\n*[[Inner product space]], normed vector spaces where the norm is given by an [[inner product]]\n*[[Finsler manifold]], where the length of each tangent vector is determined by a norm\n*[[Space (mathematics)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{Citation | title=Functional analysis and control theory: Linear systems|last=Rolewicz |first=Stefan|year=1987| isbn=90-277-2186-6| publisher=D.
