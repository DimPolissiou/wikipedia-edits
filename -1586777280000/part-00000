Fletcher was associated with two New York City baseball dynasties: the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] of [[John McGraw]] as a player; and the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] of [[Miller Huggins]] and [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] as a coach.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Collinsville, Illinois]], he batted and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|170|lb}}.\n\nFletcher came to the Giants in {{Baseball year|1909}} after only one season of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] experience, and became the club's regular shortstop two years later. He played in four [[World Series]] while performing for McGraw ([[1911 World Series|1911]], [[1912 World Series|1912]], [[1913 World Series|1913]] and [[1917 World Series|1917]]). Traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the midst of the {{Baseball year|1920}} season, he retired after the 1922 campaign with 1,534 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], 32 [[home runs]], 676 [[RBI]] and a .277 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]].  Fletcher is the Giants' career leader in being hit by pitches (132) and ranks 29th on the MLB career list (141) for the same statistic.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HBP_career.shtml</ref>\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1923}} he replaced [[Kaiser Wilhelm (baseball)|Kaiser Wilhelm]] as manager of the seventh-place Phillies and led the club through four losing seasons, bookended by last-place finishes in 1923 and 1926. In October 1926, he was replaced by [[Stuffy McInnis]].\n\nFletcher then began a 19-year tenure (1927\u201345) as a coach for the Yankees, where, beginning with the [[1927 New York Yankees season|legendary]] 1927 team, he would participate on ten [[American League]] pennant winners and nine World Series champions.

His father, [[Assistant commissioner of police (India)|Assistant Commissioner of Police]] Sivasubramanian constantly chides him for his lack of interest in studies and his love for kabaddi. In contrast, his mother dotes on him, and his younger sister Bhuvana, a sharp and inquisitive schoolgirl, constantly gets Velu into trouble with their father, but nevertheless adores him.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Madurai]], there is a ruthless factionalist leader Muthupandi, who lusts after a girl named Dhanalakshmi and would do anything to marry her. Muthupandi kills Dhanalakshmi's first elder brother as he rejects his offer to marry her. Dhanalakshmi\u2019s second elder brother is also killed by Muthupandi when he tries to avenge his brother's murder. Dhanalakshmi\u2019s father is a meek person who gets horrified by Muthupandi\u2019s acts and asks Dhanalakshmi to leave Madurai and lead a peaceful life at her uncle's place in the United States by giving her the necessary certificates and money. Muthupandi catches her when she starts fleeing, because by coincidence, she gets into one of the lorries owned by him. At this juncture, Velu, who is in Madurai to play in a kabaddi tournament, rescues Dhanalakshmi and takes her to Chennai.\n\nVelu takes Dhanalakshmi to his house and hides her in his room, unknown to his family. With the help of his friends, he arranges passport, visa, and flight tickets for Dhanalakshmi so that she can go to the US. Meanwhile, Muthupandi and his father, who is the Home Minister, ask Sivasubramanian to search for Dhanalakshmi and the apparent kidnapper. When Sivasubramanian discovers that it is his own son who did the \"crime\", Velu and Dhanalakshmi run away and hide in the [[Chennai Lighthouse]]. Dhanalakshmi has by now fallen in love with Velu, and has been accepted by his mother and sister. So she is reluctant to go to the US. Velu however, is adamant on sending her to the US, and he, along with his friends, get her to the [[Chennai International Airport]] in time for her flight before their kabaddi match against [[Punjabi kabaddi|Punjab]] in the final of the National League.\n\nSivasubramanian, enraged that his son is a wanted criminal and yet is playing in a kabaddi match, goes to the stadium to arrest Velu. By now, Velu too has fallen in love with Dhanalakshmi and begins to miss her, only to spot her in the stadium during the match. Velu's lack of focus in the game is replaced by his best performance on seeing Dhanalakshmi, winning Tamil Nadu the championship. After winning the championship, Velu is arrested by his father, but is then stopped by Muthupandi, who wants to fight Velu, having been incited by Dhanalakshmi to do so to prove his worth. Velu defeats Muthupandi and embraces Dhanalakshmi, but when Muthupandi regains consciousness and tries to kill Velu, a floodlight broken during the fight accidentally hits Muthupandi who gets electrocuted to death.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Saravanavelu (Velu) Sivasubramanian<ref name=\"Opening Credits\">''Ghilli'' (DVD): opening credits from 1.05 to 1.25</ref>\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Dhanalakshmi, as Saravanavelu's love interest<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Muthupandi, a factionalist leader<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as ACP Sivasubramanian, Saravanavelu's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Rajapandi, Muthupandi's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Janaki Sabesh|Janaki]] as Saravanavelu's mother<ref name=\"Closing Credits\">''Ghilli'' (DVD): closing credits from 157.25 to 157.30</ref>\n* [[Nancy Jennifer|Jennifer]] as Bhuvana (Bhuvi), Saravanavelu's younger sister<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Dhamu]] as Otteri Nari<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Mayilsamy]] as Narayana<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Nagendra Prasad]] as Prasad<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Chaplin Balu]] as Saravanavelu's friend<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[MBA Noohu]] as Saravanavelu's fan<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Ponnambalam (actor)|Ponnambalam]] as Arivazhagan<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Pandu (actor)|Pandu]] as Police Inspector<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Vinod Raj (Tamil actor)|Vinodraj]] as Dhanalakshmi's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[T.

His father, [[Assistant commissioner of police (India)|Assistant Commissioner of Police]] Sivasubramanian constantly chides him for his lack of interest in studies and his love for kabaddi. In contrast, his mother dotes on him, and his younger sister Bhuvana, a sharp and inquisitive schoolgirl, constantly gets Velu into trouble with their father, but nevertheless adores him.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Madurai]], there is a ruthless factionalist leader Muthupandi, who lusts after a girl named Dhanalakshmi and would do anything to marry her. Muthupandi kills Dhanalakshmi's first elder brother as he rejects his offer to marry her. Dhanalakshmi\u2019s second elder brother is also killed by Muthupandi when he tries to avenge his brother's murder. Dhanalakshmi\u2019s father is a meek person who gets horrified by Muthupandi\u2019s acts and asks Dhanalakshmi to leave Madurai and lead a peaceful life at her uncle's place in the United States by giving her the necessary certificates and money. Muthupandi catches her when she starts fleeing, because by coincidence, she gets into one of the lorries owned by him. At this juncture, Velu, who is in Madurai to play in a kabaddi tournament, rescues Dhanalakshmi and takes her to Chennai.\n\nVelu takes Dhanalakshmi to his house and hides her in his room, unknown to his family. With the help of his friends, he arranges passport, visa, and flight tickets for Dhanalakshmi so that she can go to the US. Meanwhile, Muthupandi and his father, who is the Home Minister, ask Sivasubramanian to search for Dhanalakshmi and the apparent kidnapper. When Sivasubramanian discovers that it is his own son who did the \"crime\", Velu and Dhanalakshmi run away and hide in the [[Chennai Lighthouse]]. Dhanalakshmi has by now fallen in love with Velu, and has been accepted by his mother and sister. So she is reluctant to go to the US. Velu however, is adamant on sending her to the US, and he, along with his friends, get her to the [[Chennai International Airport]] in time for her flight before their kabaddi match against [[Punjabi kabaddi|Punjab]] in the final of the National League.\n\nSivasubramanian, enraged that his son is a wanted criminal and yet is playing in a kabaddi match, goes to the stadium to arrest Velu. By now, Velu too has fallen in love with Dhanalakshmi and begins to miss her, only to spot her in the stadium during the match. Velu's lack of focus in the game is replaced by his best performance on seeing Dhanalakshmi, winning Tamil Nadu the championship. After winning the championship, Velu is arrested by his father, but is then stopped by Muthupandi, who wants to fight Velu, having been incited by Dhanalakshmi to do so to prove his worth. Velu defeats Muthupandi and embraces Dhanalakshmi, but when Muthupandi regains consciousness and tries to kill Velu, a floodlight broken during the fight accidentally hits Muthupandi who gets electrocuted to death.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Saravanavelu (Velu) Sivasubramanian<ref name=\"Opening Credits\">''Ghilli'' (DVD): opening credits from 1.05 to 1.25</ref>\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Dhanalakshmi, as Saravanavelu's love interest<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Muthupandi, a factionalist leader<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as ACP Sivasubramanian, Saravanavelu's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Rajapandi, Muthupandi's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Janaki Sabesh|Janaki]] as Saravanavelu's mother<ref name=\"Closing Credits\">''Ghilli'' (DVD): closing credits from 157.25 to 157.30</ref>\n* [[Nancy Jennifer|Jennifer]] as Bhuvana (Bhuvi), Saravanavelu's younger sister<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Dhamu]] as Otteri Nari<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Mayilsamy]] as Narayana<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Nagendra Prasad]] as Prasad<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Chaplin Balu]] as Saravanavelu's friend<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[MBA Noohu]] as Saravanavelu's fan<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Ponnambalam (actor)|Ponnambalam]] as Arivazhagan<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Pandu (actor)|Pandu]] as Police Inspector<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Vinod Raj (Tamil actor)|Vinodraj]] as Dhanalakshmi's father<ref name=\"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[T.
