Roosevelt]]'s [[1936 United States presidential election|landslide re-election]]. Roosevelt's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] gained twelve more net seats from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], bringing them above a three-fourths majority. This was the largest majority since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The last time a party won so decisively was in [[1866 United States House of Representatives elections|1866]].<ref name=\"house\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1936election.pdf |date=February 18, 1998 |title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 3, 1936 |access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSignificant representation from the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Progressives]] of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] of [[Minnesota]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} is also seen, as these two liberal [[Populism|populist]] groups gained a foothold.\n\nThe 1936 elections showed the continuing trust for the American people in that Roosevelt would guide the nation from depression. Despite setbacks, the people had faith in the [[New Deal]] and elected leaders who supported its measures. This was the last of four straight election losses for Republicans due to the lingering effects of the [[The Great Depression|Depression]].<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/25/politics/cnn-explains-gop-party/index.html |title=CNN Explains: How today's GOP has its roots in anti-slavery crusade \u2013 CNN.com |publisher=cnn.com |access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Overall results ==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:76.78%\" | '''334'''\n| style=\"background:{{Other/meta/color}}; width:2.99%\" | '''13'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:20.23%\" | '''88'''\n|-\n| Democratic\n| {{efn | Progressives had 8 seats and Farmer\u2013Labor had 5.}}\n| Republican\n|}\n\nSource: [http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ Election Statistics \u2013 Office of the Clerk]\n\n{{bar box\n|title=House seats\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=900px\n|barwidth=710px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|Democratic| {{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}|76.78}}\n{{bar percent|Farmer\u2013Labor| {{Farmer\u2013Labor Party (US)/meta/color}}|1.15}}\n{{bar percent|Progressive| {{Progressive Party (Wisconsin)/meta/color}}|1.84}}\n{{bar percent|Republican| {{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}|20.23}}\n}}\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:75 us house membership.png|thumb|450px|\n{|\n! colspan=3 align=center | House seats by party holding plurality in state\n|-\n| {{Legend|#00f|80.1-100% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f00|80.1-100% Republican}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#09f|60.1-80% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f66|60.1-80% Republican}}\n| {{Legend|#9f9|60.1-80% Progressive}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#0ff|50.1-60% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f99|50.1-60% Republican}}\n| {{Legend|#fc9|50.1-60% Farmer\u2013Labor}}\n|}]]\n| [[File:75 us house changes.png|thumb|450px|\n{| {{Legend|#00f|6+ Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f00|6+ Republican gain}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#09f|3-5 Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f66|3-5 Republican gain}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#0ff|1-2 Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f99|1-2 Republican gain}}\n| {{Legend|#fc9|1-2 Farmer\u2013Labor gain}}\n|-\n| align=center colspan=3 | {{Legend|#ccc|no net change}}\n|}]]\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n== Results by state ==\n\n== Alabama ==\n<!--{{main|1936 United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama}}-->\n{{See also|List of United States Representatives from Alabama}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Roosevelt]]'s [[1936 United States presidential election|landslide re-election]]. Roosevelt's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] gained twelve more net seats from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], bringing them above a three-fourths majority. This was the largest majority since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The last time a party won so decisively was in [[1866 United States House of Representatives elections|1866]].<ref name=\"house\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1936election.pdf |date=February 18, 1998 |title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 3, 1936 |access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSignificant representation from the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Progressives]] of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] of [[Minnesota]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} is also seen, as these two liberal [[Populism|populist]] groups gained a foothold.\n\nThe 1936 elections showed the continuing trust for the American people in that Roosevelt would guide the nation from depression. Despite setbacks, the people had faith in the [[New Deal]] and elected leaders who supported its measures. This was the last of four straight election losses for Republicans due to the lingering effects of the [[The Great Depression|Depression]].<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/25/politics/cnn-explains-gop-party/index.html |title=CNN Explains: How today's GOP has its roots in anti-slavery crusade \u2013 CNN.com |publisher=cnn.com |access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Overall results ==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:76.78%\" | '''334'''\n| style=\"background:{{Other/meta/color}}; width:2.99%\" | '''13'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:20.23%\" | '''88'''\n|-\n| Democratic\n| {{efn | Progressives had 8 seats and Farmer\u2013Labor had 5.}}\n| Republican\n|}\n\nSource: [http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ Election Statistics \u2013 Office of the Clerk]\n\n{{bar box\n|title=House seats\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=900px\n|barwidth=710px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|Democratic| {{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}|76.78}}\n{{bar percent|Farmer\u2013Labor| {{Farmer\u2013Labor Party (US)/meta/color}}|1.15}}\n{{bar percent|Progressive| {{Progressive Party (Wisconsin)/meta/color}}|1.84}}\n{{bar percent|Republican| {{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}|20.23}}\n}}\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:75 us house membership.png|thumb|450px|\n{|\n! colspan=3 align=center | House seats by party holding plurality in state\n|-\n| {{Legend|#00f|80.1-100% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f00|80.1-100% Republican}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#09f|60.1-80% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f66|60.1-80% Republican}}\n| {{Legend|#9f9|60.1-80% Progressive}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#0ff|50.1-60% Democratic}}\n| {{Legend|#f99|50.1-60% Republican}}\n| {{Legend|#fc9|50.1-60% Farmer\u2013Labor}}\n|}]]\n| [[File:75 us house changes.png|thumb|450px|\n{| {{Legend|#00f|6+ Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f00|6+ Republican gain}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#09f|3-5 Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f66|3-5 Republican gain}}\n|-\n| {{Legend|#0ff|1-2 Democratic gain}}\n| {{Legend|#f99|1-2 Republican gain}}\n| {{Legend|#fc9|1-2 Farmer\u2013Labor gain}}\n|-\n| align=center colspan=3 | {{Legend|#ccc|no net change}}\n|}]]\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n== Results by state ==\n\n== Alabama ==\n<!--{{main|1936 United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama}}-->\n{{See also|List of United States Representatives from Alabama}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|- valign=bottom\n!

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nIn the breakout scenario, the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the attack helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nIn the breakout scenario, the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the attack helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks.

Euromaidan Protests.jpg |thumb  |200px |Improvised [[molotov cocktail]]s ]]\n'''Insurgency weapons and tactics''' are weapons and tactics, most often involving [[firearm]]s or explosive devices, intended for use by [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s to engage in [[guerrilla warfare]] against an occupier, or for use by rebels against an established government.  One type of insurgency weapon are \"homemade\" firearms made by non-professionals, such as the [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]] (Lightning)  [[submachine gun]]  produced in underground workshops by the Polish [[resistance movement]]. Another insurgency weapon is a sanitized weapon, which is a weapon of any sort that has had normal markings, such as the manufacturer's name and/or serial number, omitted or obscured in an attempt to hide the origin of the weapon.\n\nA weapon that is part of the conventional military arsenal, but which has been taken up to great effect by insurgents, is the RPG<!-- In many guerrilla conflicts, the RPG has been the \"great leveler\", enabling small groups of insurgents to take out enemy helicopters, tanks, and APCs  -->. Two examples of an improvised weapon used by insurgents would be the [[improvised explosive device]]s used in [[Iraq]] and the [[Molotov cocktail]]s (glass bottles filled with gasoline) used against vehicles and tanks. Two tactics used by many insurgents are assassinations and suicide bomb attacks. The latter tactic is used when an insurgent has a bomb strapped to them or in their car, which provides a low-tech way for insurgents to get explosives close to critical enemy targets.\n\n== Purpose-designed weapons ==\nA fairly recent class of firearms, purpose-designed insurgency weapons first appeared during [[World War II]], in the form of such arms as the [[FP-45 Liberator]] and the [[Sten]] [[submachine gun]]. Designed to be inexpensive, since they were to be [[airdrop]]ped or smuggled behind enemy lines, insurgency weapons were designed for use by guerrilla and insurgent groups. Most insurgency weapons are of simple design, typically made of sheet [[steel]] [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]]s, which are then folded into shape and welded. Tubular steel in standard sizes is also used when possible, and barrels (one of the few firearm parts that require fine tolerances and high strength) may be [[rifled]] (like the Sten) or left [[smoothbore]] (like the FP-45).\n\nThe CIA [[Deer gun]] of the 1960s was similar to the Liberator, but used an aluminum casting for the body of the pistol, and was chambered in [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]], one of the all-time most common handgun cartridges in the world. There is no known explanation for the name \"Deer Gun\", but the Deer Gun was intended to be smuggled into [[Vietnam]], attested by the instruction sheet printed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. It was produced by the American Machine & Foundry Co., but was a ''sanitized'' weapon, meaning it lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user. Details of the manufacture of insurgency weapons are almost always deliberately obscured by the governments making them, as in the designation of the FP-45 pistol.\n\nOther insurgency weapons may be sanitized versions of traditional [[infantry]] or [[defensive weapon|defensive]] weapons. These may be purpose-made without markings, or they may be standard commercial or military arms that have been altered to remove the manufacturers markings. Due to the covert nature of insurgency weapons, documenting their history is often difficult. Those that can legally be traded on the civilian market, like the [[FP-45 Liberator|Liberator pistol]], will often command high prices; although millions of the pistols were made, few survived the war.\n\nThese examples are all arms that were either used as insurgency weapons, or designed for such use. ''Purpose-built'' weapons were designed from the start to be used primarily for insurgent use, and are fairly crude, very inexpensive, and simple to operate; many were packaged with instructions targeted to speakers of certain languages, or pictorial instructions usable by [[illiterate]] users or speakers of any language. ''Dual-use'' weapons are those that were designed with special allowances for use by insurgent troops. ''Sanitized'' weapons are any arms that have been manufactured or altered to remove markings that indicate point of origin. RPGs are weapons from the standard military arsenal that have been used to a powerful effect by guerrilla forces. IEDs are improvised explosive devices.\n\n[[Image:FP-45 Liberator.jpg|thumb|FP-45 Liberator]]\nThe [[FP-45 Liberator]] was a single-shot [[.45 ACP]] [[derringer]]-type pistol, made by the U.S. during [[World War II]]. It was made from stamped steel with an unrifled barrel. The designation \"FP\" stood for \"flare projector\", which was apparently an attempt to disguise the use of its intended purpose by obscuring the nature of the project. It was packed with ten rounds of ammunition, and was intended to be used for [[assassinating]] enemy soldiers so that their weapons could then be captured and used by the insurgents. The instructions were pictorial, so that the gun could be distributed in any theatre of war, and used even by illiterate operators. The country in which the largest quantity was used was the [[Philippines]].\n\n[[File:TYT1-T-F2-H.jpg|thumb|left|Deer gun]]\nThe CIA [[Deer gun]] was a single-shot [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]] pistol, made by the U.S. during the [[Vietnam War]]. It was packaged with three rounds of ammunition in the grip, and packed with instructions in a plastic box. If air-dropped into water, the plastic box containing the pistol would float. Like the earlier FP-45 Liberator, it was designed primarily for assassination of enemy soldiers, with the intention that it would be replaced by an enemy soldier's left-over equipment. The instructions for the Deer Gun were pictorial, with text in Vietnamese.\n\nAlthough various submachine guns were manufactured in Northern Ireland with \"Round Sections\" (Round shaped receivers) and \"Square Sections\" (Square shaped receivers), the Avenger submachine gun which was used by Loyalist Paramilitaries was considered one of the best designs for its type. The bolts were telescoping with a forward recoil/return spring with in the rear, a heavy coil spring that acts as a buffer increasing accuracy and recoil handling. The barrels were usually found lacking rifling but this can in some cases possibly increase ballistics at close quarters. It used Sten magazines and had the capabilities of adapting [[suppressor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amodestpublication.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/|title=08 - May - 2009 -|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s\u201380s, International Ordnance Group of San Antonio, Texas released the [[International Ordnance MP2|MP2]] machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact alternative to the British Sten gun (although in its components and overall design have nothing directly similar to the STEN), to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to \"friendly\" undercover forces. Much like the previously mentioned FP-45 \"Liberator\" pistol of World War 2, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force's arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire. A more common weapon of Guatemalan origin is the [[SM-9]]. Another example is the [[M\u00e9tral submachine gun]] designed by Gerard M\u00e9tral intended for manufacture during occupation and undercover circumstances.<ref>The Do-it-Yourself Submachine Gun: Its Homemade, 9mm, Lightweight, Durable And Itll Never Be On Any Import Ban Lists!.

It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet in such a way that ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the [[Cold War]].{{fact|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[File:Hillberg patent 3260009.png|left|thumb|Clip of Hillberg's patent for the 4 barrelled Liberator shotgun design.]]\nThe [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] [[Winchester Liberator|Liberator]] is a [[16-gauge]], four-barrelled [[shotgun]], similar to a scaled-up four-shot [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[derringer]]. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. [[Robert Hillberg]], the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective in the hands of someone who had never handled a [[firearm]] before. Pistols and [[submachine gun]]s were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.\n\n: More specifically, this invention relates to a four barrel break-open firearm which has a minimum number of working parts, is simple to operate even by inexperienced personnel, and is economical to manufacture.\n: \u2014Second paragraph of U.S. Patent 3,260,009, by Robert Hillberg granted 1964\n\n=== Dual-use weapons ===\n[[Image:A Welrod 9mm pistol on display at the Imperial War Museum in London..jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Welrod 9mm pistol]]\nSome purpose-designed insurgency weapons were designed for a dual use\u2013that is for use by both insurgents and conventional soldiers. The [[Welrod]] pistol was a simple, [[bolt-action]] pistol developed by the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] for use in [[World War II]]. It was designed  for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral sound [[suppressor]], and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost no noise, and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated nearly all of the muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a hand-grip, and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.\n\nThe [[Sten]] was a [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]] [[submachine gun]] manufactured by the [[United Kingdom]] in [[World War II]]. Although not designed as an insurgency weapon, it was designed at a time when Britain had a dire need for weapons and was designed to be easily produced in basic machine shops and use a readily available round, it was therefore the ideal weapon to be produced by resistance groups in occupied territories. Towards the end of the war, the German were in need of weapons and they produced both a version of the Sten, the [[MP 3008]],  to arm the [[Volkssturm]] and near identical copies of the Sten down to makers marks to arm the [[Werwolf]] insurgency force.\n\n==Other insurgency weapons==\n===Shotguns===\nDue to the widespread use of the shotgun as a sporting firearm, it is used in [[guerrilla warfare]] and other forms of [[asymmetric warfare]].  [[Che Guevara]], in his 1961 book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'', notes that shotgun ammunition can be obtained by guerrillas  even in times of war, and that shotguns loaded with heavy shot are highly effective against unarmored troop transport vehicles.  He recommends that suburban guerrilla bands should be armed with easily concealable weapons, such as  [[handgun]]s and a [[sawed-off shotgun]] or carbine.\n\n===Homemade or improvised firearms===\n[[File:Home-made 12-gauge shotgun used by Bosniac fighters.jpg|thumb|right|A crude but effective improvised 12-gauge shotgun used during the [[Bosnian War]]]]\n{{main|Improvised firearm}}\nThe [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]] (Lightning) was a simple [[submachine gun]]  produced by the [[Armia Krajowa]], or Home Army, a Polish [[resistance movement]] fighting the [[Germany|Germans]] in [[History of Poland (1939\u201345)|occupied Poland]]. It was produced in underground workshops. Its main feature was its simplicity, so that the weapon could be made even in small workshops, by inexperienced engineers. It used threaded pipes for simplicity.\n\nIn some cases, Guerrillas have used improvised, repurposed firearms. One example is described by [[Che Guevara]] in his book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]''.   Called the \"M-16\", it consists of a 16 gauge [[sawed-off shotgun]] provided with a bipod to hold the barrel at a 45-degree angle.  This was loaded with a [[blank (cartridge)|blank cartridge]] formed by removing the shot from a standard shot shell, followed by a wooden rod with a [[Molotov cocktail]] attached to the front.  This formed an improvised [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] capable of firing the incendiary device accurately out to a range of 100 meters.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guerrilla Warfare |author=Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara |year=1961 |publisher=Praeger}}</ref>\n\n[[Flare gun]]s have also been converted to firearms.  This may be accomplished by replacing the (often plastic) barrel of the flare gun with a metal pipe strong enough to chamber a [[shotgun shell]], or by inserting a smaller bore barrel into the existing barrel (such as with a [[caliber conversion sleeve]]) to chamber a firearm cartridge, such as a [[.22 Long Rifle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Newsletters/PSN%20Newsletter%20Winter%202003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Project Safe Neighborhoods |author=US Department of Justice, District of Connecticut |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040725095406/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Newsletters/PSN%20Newsletter%20Winter%202003.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/964416.P.pdf |format=PDF|title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v.

These were made in Yugoslavia for delivery to [[Egypt]] prior to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. Yugoslavia was technically a neutral country, and by sanitizing the rifles sold to the Egyptians, it hoped to distance itself from the conflict between [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]]. Only a few hundred of the few thousand made were delivered to Egypt, the rest remaining in storage in Yugoslavia until recently rediscovered. They are currently being sold to civilian collectors.\n\n=== Plausible deniability ===\nIn the present day [[plausible deniability]] allows the supply of arms by governments to insurgents without the need for over elaborate ruses. For example, the sheer number of [[AKM]] (an upgraded version of the AK-47 rifle) manufacturers and [[AKM#Users and local versions|users]] in the world means that governments can supply these weapons to insurgents with plausible deniability as to exactly from where and from whom the guns were acquired.\n\n===RPGs===\n[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|A rebel in northern Central African Republic with an RPG]]\n[[Rocket-propelled grenades]] (RPGs) were used extensively during the [[Vietnam War]] (by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] and [[Vietcong]]),<ref>[http://www.mrfa.org/ccbfund.htm CCB-18 Memorial Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174558/http://www.mrfa.org/ccbfund.htm |date=2014-10-06 }}</ref> [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Mujahideen]] and against South Africans in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (formerly [[South West Africa]]) by [[SWAPO]] guarillas during what the South Africans called the [[South African Border War]]. Twenty years later, they are still being used widely in recent conflict areas such as [[Chechnya]], [[Iraq]], and [[Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe RPG still remains a potent threat to armored vehicles, especially in situations such as [[urban warfare]] or [[jungle warfare]], where they are favored by guerrillas. They are most effective when used in restricted terrain as the availability of cover and concealment can make it difficult for the intended target to spot the RPG operator. Note that this concealment is often preferably outdoors, because firing an RPG within an enclosed area may create a dangerous [[backblast area|backblast]].\n\nIn Afghanistan, [[Mujahideen]] guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle.

During the [[First Chechen War|First]] (1994\u20131996) and [[Second Chechen War]]s (1999\u20132009), [[Chechnya|Chechen]] rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. Chechen fighters formed independent \"cells\" that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target.\n\nUsing RPGs as improvised anti aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya. [[Helicopter]]s are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover.\n\n===IEDs===\n[[File:Cougar Hit By IED.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Cougar (MRAP)|Cougar]] in Al Anbar, Iraq, was hit by a directed charge IED approximately 300\u2013500 lbs in size.]]\n\nAn [[improvised explosive device]] ('''IED'''), also known as a '''roadside bomb''', is a homemade [[bomb]] constructed and deployed in ways other than in [[conventional warfare|conventional]] [[military]] action.

In the second [[Iraq War]], IEDs were used extensively against US-led Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of Coalition deaths in Iraq. They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of the Coalition casualties in the  [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001\u2013present Afghanistan War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID=news/capfeed/national/n102529A.xml |title=home.mytelus.com |publisher=home.mytelus.com |accessdate=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314021502/http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID=news%2Fcapfeed%2Fnational%2Fn102529A.xml |archivedate=2012-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel [[Tamil Tiger]] (LTTE) organization against military targets in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/srilanka/globalthreat.html |title=Suicide Terrorism: A Global Threat |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/13/stories/2006041304711500.htm |title=13 killed in blasts, arson in Sri Lanka |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2009-10-18 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n===Molotov cocktail===\nThe [[Molotov cocktail]] is a generic name used for a variety of [[Improvization|improvised]] [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]]. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in [[urban guerrilla warfare]]s. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as [[gasoline|gasoline/petrol]] or a [[napalm]]-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth [[Capillary action|wick]] held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or [[kerosene]], rather than gasoline.\n\n===Improvised mortars===\n[[File:Barrack buster feb 2010.jpg|left|thumb|[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] improvised mortar tube.]]\n[[File:Improvised-mortars-batey-haosef-1-1.jpg|thumb|Improvised mortars in Batey ha-Osef Museum, Tel Aviv, Israel.]]\n\nImprovised, or \"home-made\", mortars have been used by [[insurgency|insurgent]] groups, usually to attack fortified military installations or to terrorize civilians. They are usually constructed from heavy steel piping mounted on a steel frame. These weapons may fire standard mortar rounds, purpose made shells, re-purposed gas cylinders filled with explosives and shrapnel, or any other type of improvised explosive, incendiary or chemical munitions. These were called [[Barrack buster|\"Barrack Busters\"]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)]]. They are known as [[Hell cannon|\"Hell Cannons\"]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]], where observers have noted that they are \"wildly inaccurate\" and responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-hell-cannons-kill-300-civilians-monitoring-122622024.html |title=Syrian rebel 'hell cannons' kill 300 civilians: monitoring group |work=Reuters |agency=[[Yahoo! News]] |author=Oliver Holmes |date=December 12, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Insurgency tactics==\n{{terrorism}}\n\n===Agents and sympathizers in place===\nInsurgent organizations may recruit members of the government's civil and security forces to their cause or to have their own members join them. In addition to being able to provide intelligence and possibly provide direct and indirect aid, doing so allows insurgent members to gain military training and skills which they would not otherwise be able to access, these members may then serve as a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] to train other insurgents, those who rise high enough may become [[agents of influence]].\n\n===Agitation===\nOften grouped together with propaganda as [[agitprop]], agitation is the use of [[agitator]]s to stir up discontent both real and imagined with the regime and to propose a course of action to right these perceived wrongs. The traditional targets of agitators have been the [[shop floor]], [[students' union]]s and the junior officer's [[Mess|mess halls]] of the military.\n\n===Assassinations===\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\n\nThe [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919\u201321 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit \u2013 [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] \u2013 for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.\n\nThis tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.\n\n[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.\n\nThe [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[State of Vietnam|Diem regime]] to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' \u2013 Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>\n\n===Bank robberies===\nBank robberies have been used by insurgents and revolutionaries in order to fund their activities, for example the [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery]], using violence in excess of that needed to achieve the aims of the robberies helps contributes to a [[Culture of fear|climate of fear]].\n\n===Group participation in atrocities===\nAs an [[initiation]] new recruits, especially forced ones, will be encouraged or forced to participate in atrocities, such as torture, rape and murder, unwilling recruits will be forced to do this against their own communities and families or be killed themselves. The goal of these atrocities is to divorce the new recruit from his or her previous life and bind them to the insurgency; criminals in their own eyes and in the eyes of society, such recruits will be led to believe that they cannot go back to their previous lives and have no other family other than the insurgency. In order to break the hold the insurgency may hold over such members, the authorities may offer amnesties and pardons for crimes committed.\n\n===Kidnapping===\nInsurgents kidnap and take hostage members of the general public for ransom in order to fund the activities of the insurgents. The kidnapping of family members may be used to coerce co-operation, the provision of information, use of a property as a safe house, a copy of a key etc. High value hostages may be taken in order to force the release of captured comrades and as media spectaculars. At all levels creating a fear of kidnapping reinforces a message that the state and its security forces cannot protect you.\n\n===Law and order===\nInsurgents may attempt to create a parallel system of  \"justice\" with punishment beatings and killings of criminals in order to ingratiate themselves with the populace. Especially in corrupt and failed regimes where there is a deficit of true justice people's and revolutionary courts aim to legitimize the insurgents as a government in waiting. This is doubly so if insurgents are seen as bringing order in failed regimes, ones with weak central control, and ones in which the security forces are as bad as would be thieves and bandits.\n\n===Propaganda===\n[[Propaganda]] is used to sell to the populace the legitimacy, morality and ability of the insurgents, whilst at the same time portraying the government and its security forces in a negative light. This propaganda can be [[Propaganda of the deed|of the deed]], spectacular acts of assassination, sabotage and violence, relying on the mass media to spread the insurgents message. If the state seeks to starve the insurgents of the \"oxygen of publicity\" the older means of disseminating the insurgents message is by [[pamphlet]]ting (e.g. [[Thomas Paine]]'s [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]) and through use of the oral tradition of stories, [[Irish rebel song|rebel]] and [[revolutionary song]]s, modern insurgents use the internet.\n\n===Sabotage===\n[[Sabotage]] against infrastructure, for example power stations, airports and reservoir at the upper end, and for example electricity pylons, substations, telephone exchanges and railway tracks at the lower end make real to the populace that an insurgency is underway; and if sustained can affect the quality of life of the populace. In order to protect all the possible targets that the insurgents may attack government forces may be stretched to the point where they become vulnerable to a [[defeat in detail]].\n\n===Suicide attacks===\n[[Hezbollah]]'s attacks in 1983 during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] are the first examples of the modern suicide terrorism.<ref name=rwkckb07>{{cite journal|last=Kurz|first=Robert W.|author2=Charles K.

Euromaidan Protests.jpg |thumb  |200px |Improvised [[molotov cocktail]]s ]]\n'''Insurgency weapons and tactics''' are weapons and tactics, most often involving [[firearm]]s or explosive devices, intended for use by [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s to engage in [[guerrilla warfare]] against an occupier, or for use by rebels against an established government.  One type of insurgency weapon are \"homemade\" firearms made by non-professionals, such as the [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]] (Lightning)  [[submachine gun]]  produced in underground workshops by the Polish [[resistance movement]]. Another insurgency weapon is a sanitized weapon, which is a weapon of any sort that has had normal markings, such as the manufacturer's name and/or serial number, omitted or obscured in an attempt to hide the origin of the weapon.\n\nA weapon that is part of the conventional military arsenal, but which has been taken up to great effect by insurgents, is the RPG<!-- In many guerrilla conflicts, the RPG has been the \"great leveler\", enabling small groups of insurgents to take out enemy helicopters, tanks, and APCs  -->. Two examples of an improvised weapon used by insurgents would be the [[improvised explosive device]]s used in [[Iraq]] and the [[Molotov cocktail]]s (glass bottles filled with gasoline) used against vehicles and tanks. Two tactics used by many insurgents are assassinations and suicide bomb attacks. The latter tactic is used when an insurgent has a bomb strapped to them or in their car, which provides a low-tech way for insurgents to get explosives close to critical enemy targets.\n\n== Purpose-designed weapons ==\nA fairly recent class of firearms, purpose-designed insurgency weapons first appeared during [[World War II]], in the form of such arms as the [[FP-45 Liberator]] and the [[Sten]] [[submachine gun]]. Designed to be inexpensive, since they were to be [[airdrop]]ped or smuggled behind enemy lines, insurgency weapons were designed for use by guerrilla and insurgent groups. Most insurgency weapons are of simple design, typically made of sheet [[steel]] [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]]s, which are then folded into shape and welded. Tubular steel in standard sizes is also used when possible, and barrels (one of the few firearm parts that require fine tolerances and high strength) may be [[rifled]] (like the Sten) or left [[smoothbore]] (like the FP-45).\n\nThe CIA [[Deer gun]] of the 1960s was similar to the Liberator, but used an aluminum casting for the body of the pistol, and was chambered in [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]], one of the all-time most common handgun cartridges in the world. There is no known explanation for the name \"Deer Gun\", but the Deer Gun was intended to be smuggled into [[Vietnam]], attested by the instruction sheet printed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. It was produced by the American Machine & Foundry Co., but was a ''sanitized'' weapon, meaning it lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user. Details of the manufacture of insurgency weapons are almost always deliberately obscured by the governments making them, as in the designation of the FP-45 pistol.\n\nOther insurgency weapons may be sanitized versions of traditional [[infantry]] or [[defensive weapon|defensive]] weapons. These may be purpose-made without markings, or they may be standard commercial or military arms that have been altered to remove the manufacturers markings. Due to the covert nature of insurgency weapons, documenting their history is often difficult. Those that can legally be traded on the civilian market, like the [[FP-45 Liberator|Liberator pistol]], will often command high prices; although millions of the pistols were made, few survived the war.\n\nThese examples are all arms that were either used as insurgency weapons, or designed for such use. ''Purpose-built'' weapons were designed from the start to be used primarily for insurgent use, and are fairly crude, very inexpensive, and simple to operate; many were packaged with instructions targeted to speakers of certain languages, or pictorial instructions usable by [[illiterate]] users or speakers of any language. ''Dual-use'' weapons are those that were designed with special allowances for use by insurgent troops. ''Sanitized'' weapons are any arms that have been manufactured or altered to remove markings that indicate point of origin. RPGs are weapons from the standard military arsenal that have been used to a powerful effect by guerrilla forces. IEDs are improvised explosive devices.\n\n[[Image:FP-45 Liberator.jpg|thumb|FP-45 Liberator]]\nThe [[FP-45 Liberator]] was a single-shot [[.45 ACP]] [[derringer]]-type pistol, made by the U.S. during [[World War II]]. It was made from stamped steel with an unrifled barrel. The designation \"FP\" stood for \"flare projector\", which was apparently an attempt to disguise the use of its intended purpose by obscuring the nature of the project. It was packed with ten rounds of ammunition, and was intended to be used for [[assassinating]] enemy soldiers so that their weapons could then be captured and used by the insurgents. The instructions were pictorial, so that the gun could be distributed in any theatre of war, and used even by illiterate operators. The country in which the largest quantity was used was the [[Philippines]].\n\n[[File:TYT1-T-F2-H.jpg|thumb|left|Deer gun]]\nThe CIA [[Deer gun]] was a single-shot [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]] pistol, made by the U.S. during the [[Vietnam War]]. It was packaged with three rounds of ammunition in the grip, and packed with instructions in a plastic box. If air-dropped into water, the plastic box containing the pistol would float. Like the earlier FP-45 Liberator, it was designed primarily for assassination of enemy soldiers, with the intention that it would be replaced by an enemy soldier's left-over equipment. The instructions for the Deer Gun were pictorial, with text in Vietnamese.\n\nAlthough various submachine guns were manufactured in Northern Ireland with \"Round Sections\" (Round shaped receivers) and \"Square Sections\" (Square shaped receivers), the Avenger submachine gun which was used by Loyalist Paramilitaries was considered one of the best designs for its type. The bolts were telescoping with a forward recoil/return spring with in the rear, a heavy coil spring that acts as a buffer increasing accuracy and recoil handling. The barrels were usually found lacking rifling but this can in some cases possibly increase ballistics at close quarters. It used Sten magazines and had the capabilities of adapting [[suppressor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amodestpublication.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/|title=08 - May - 2009 -|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s\u201380s, International Ordnance Group of San Antonio, Texas released the [[International Ordnance MP2|MP2]] machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact alternative to the British Sten gun (although in its components and overall design have nothing directly similar to the STEN), to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to \"friendly\" undercover forces. Much like the previously mentioned FP-45 \"Liberator\" pistol of World War 2, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force's arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire. A more common weapon of Guatemalan origin is the [[SM-9]]. Another example is the [[M\u00e9tral submachine gun]] designed by Gerard M\u00e9tral intended for manufacture during occupation and undercover circumstances.<ref>The Do-it-Yourself Submachine Gun: Its Homemade, 9mm, Lightweight, Durable And Itll Never Be On Any Import Ban Lists!.

It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet in such a way that ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the [[Cold War]].{{fact|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[File:Hillberg patent 3260009.png|left|thumb|Clip of Hillberg's patent for the 4 barrelled Liberator shotgun design.]]\nThe [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] [[Winchester Liberator|Liberator]] is a [[16-gauge]], four-barrelled [[shotgun]], similar to a scaled-up four-shot [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[derringer]]. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. [[Robert Hillberg]], the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective in the hands of someone who had never handled a [[firearm]] before. Pistols and [[submachine gun]]s were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.\n\n: More specifically, this invention relates to a four barrel break-open firearm which has a minimum number of working parts, is simple to operate even by inexperienced personnel, and is economical to manufacture.\n: \u2014Second paragraph of U.S. Patent 3,260,009, by Robert Hillberg granted 1964\n\n=== Dual-use weapons ===\n[[Image:A Welrod 9mm pistol on display at the Imperial War Museum in London..jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Welrod 9mm pistol]]\nSome purpose-designed insurgency weapons were designed for a dual use\u2013that is for use by both insurgents and conventional soldiers. The [[Welrod]] pistol was a simple, [[bolt-action]] pistol developed by the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] for use in [[World War II]]. It was designed  for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral sound [[suppressor]], and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost no noise, and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated nearly all of the muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a hand-grip, and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.\n\nThe [[Sten]] was a [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9\u00d719 mm Parabellum]] [[submachine gun]] manufactured by the [[United Kingdom]] in [[World War II]]. Although not designed as an insurgency weapon, it was designed at a time when Britain had a dire need for weapons and was designed to be easily produced in basic machine shops and use a readily available round, it was therefore the ideal weapon to be produced by resistance groups in occupied territories. Towards the end of the war, the German were in need of weapons and they produced both a version of the Sten, the [[MP 3008]],  to arm the [[Volkssturm]] and near identical copies of the Sten down to makers marks to arm the [[Werwolf]] insurgency force.\n\n==Other insurgency weapons==\n===Shotguns===\nDue to the widespread use of the shotgun as a sporting firearm, it is used in [[guerrilla warfare]] and other forms of [[asymmetric warfare]].  [[Che Guevara]], in his 1961 book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'', notes that shotgun ammunition can be obtained by guerrillas  even in times of war, and that shotguns loaded with heavy shot are highly effective against unarmored troop transport vehicles.  He recommends that suburban guerrilla bands should be armed with easily concealable weapons, such as  [[handgun]]s and a [[sawed-off shotgun]] or carbine.\n\n===Homemade or improvised firearms===\n[[File:Home-made 12-gauge shotgun used by Bosniac fighters.jpg|thumb|right|A crude but effective improvised 12-gauge shotgun used during the [[Bosnian War]]]]\n{{main|Improvised firearm}}\nThe [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]] (Lightning) was a simple [[submachine gun]]  produced by the [[Armia Krajowa]], or Home Army, a Polish [[resistance movement]] fighting the [[Germany|Germans]] in [[History of Poland (1939\u201345)|occupied Poland]]. It was produced in underground workshops. Its main feature was its simplicity, so that the weapon could be made even in small workshops, by inexperienced engineers. It used threaded pipes for simplicity.\n\nIn some cases, Guerrillas have used improvised, repurposed firearms. One example is described by [[Che Guevara]] in his book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]''.   Called the \"M-16\", it consists of a 16 gauge [[sawed-off shotgun]] provided with a bipod to hold the barrel at a 45-degree angle.  This was loaded with a [[blank (cartridge)|blank cartridge]] formed by removing the shot from a standard shot shell, followed by a wooden rod with a [[Molotov cocktail]] attached to the front.  This formed an improvised [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] capable of firing the incendiary device accurately out to a range of 100 meters.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guerrilla Warfare |author=Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara |year=1961 |publisher=Praeger}}</ref>\n\n[[Flare gun]]s have also been converted to firearms.  This may be accomplished by replacing the (often plastic) barrel of the flare gun with a metal pipe strong enough to chamber a [[shotgun shell]], or by inserting a smaller bore barrel into the existing barrel (such as with a [[caliber conversion sleeve]]) to chamber a firearm cartridge, such as a [[.22 Long Rifle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Newsletters/PSN%20Newsletter%20Winter%202003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Project Safe Neighborhoods |author=US Department of Justice, District of Connecticut |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040725095406/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Newsletters/PSN%20Newsletter%20Winter%202003.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/964416.P.pdf |format=PDF|title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v.

These were made in Yugoslavia for delivery to [[Egypt]] prior to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. Yugoslavia was technically a neutral country, and by sanitizing the rifles sold to the Egyptians, it hoped to distance itself from the conflict between [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]]. Only a few hundred of the few thousand made were delivered to Egypt, the rest remaining in storage in Yugoslavia until recently rediscovered. They are currently being sold to civilian collectors.\n\n=== Plausible deniability ===\nIn the present day [[plausible deniability]] allows the supply of arms by governments to insurgents without the need for over elaborate ruses. For example, the sheer number of [[AKM]] (an upgraded version of the AK-47 rifle) manufacturers and [[AKM#Users and local versions|users]] in the world means that governments can supply these weapons to insurgents with plausible deniability as to exactly from where and from whom the guns were acquired.\n\n===RPGs===\n[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|A rebel in northern Central African Republic with an RPG]]\n[[Rocket-propelled grenades]] (RPGs) were used extensively during the [[Vietnam War]] (by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] and [[Vietcong]]),<ref>[http://www.mrfa.org/ccbfund.htm CCB-18 Memorial Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174558/http://www.mrfa.org/ccbfund.htm |date=2014-10-06 }}</ref> [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Mujahideen]] and against South Africans in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (formerly [[South West Africa]]) by [[SWAPO]] guarillas during what the South Africans called the [[South African Border War]]. Twenty years later, they are still being used widely in recent conflict areas such as [[Chechnya]], [[Iraq]], and [[Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe RPG still remains a potent threat to armored vehicles, especially in situations such as [[urban warfare]] or [[jungle warfare]], where they are favored by guerrillas. They are most effective when used in restricted terrain as the availability of cover and concealment can make it difficult for the intended target to spot the RPG operator. Note that this concealment is often preferably outdoors, because firing an RPG within an enclosed area may create a dangerous [[backblast area|backblast]].\n\nIn Afghanistan, [[Mujahideen]] guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armor-vehicle hunter-killer teams can have as many as 15 RPG.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Weapons of the insurgents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5NIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67|date=March 2004|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=67}}</ref> Afghans sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly 950m flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for infantry and reconnaissance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harnden|first=Toby|title=Dead Men Risen: The Welsh Guards and the Defining Story of Britain's War in Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYI0VodiSFkC&pg=PT608|year=2011|publisher=Quercus Publishing|isbn=978-1-84916-805-2|page=608}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[South African Border War]], the Soviet RPGs used by [[SWAPO]] guerrillas and their [[Angola]]n supporters posed a serious threat to [[South Africa]]'s lightly armored [[armored personnel carrier|APCs]], which could be easily targeted as soon as they stopped to disembark troops. During the [[First Chechen War|First]] (1994\u20131996) and [[Second Chechen War]]s (1999\u20132009), [[Chechnya|Chechen]] rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. Chechen fighters formed independent \"cells\" that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target.\n\nUsing RPGs as improvised anti aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya. [[Helicopter]]s are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover.\n\n===IEDs===\n[[File:Cougar Hit By IED.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Cougar (vehicle)|Cougar]] in Al Anbar, Iraq, was hit by a directed charge IED approximately 300\u2013500 lbs in size.]]\n\nAn [[improvised explosive device]] ('''IED'''), also known as a '''roadside bomb''', is a homemade [[bomb]] constructed and deployed in ways other than in [[conventional warfare|conventional]] [[military]] action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism.\n\nIEDs may be used in [[terrorist]] actions or in [[unconventional warfare]] by [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s or [[commando]] forces in a [[theater (warfare)|theater of operations]]. In the second [[Iraq War]], IEDs were used extensively against US-led Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of Coalition deaths in Iraq. They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of the Coalition casualties in the  [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001\u2013present Afghanistan War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID=news/capfeed/national/n102529A.xml |title=home.mytelus.com |publisher=home.mytelus.com |accessdate=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314021502/http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID=news%2Fcapfeed%2Fnational%2Fn102529A.xml |archivedate=2012-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel [[Tamil Tiger]] (LTTE) organization against military targets in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/srilanka/globalthreat.html |title=Suicide Terrorism: A Global Threat |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/13/stories/2006041304711500.htm |title=13 killed in blasts, arson in Sri Lanka |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2009-10-18 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n===Molotov cocktail===\nThe [[Molotov cocktail]] is a generic name used for a variety of [[Improvization|improvised]] [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]]. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in [[urban guerrilla warfare]]s. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as [[gasoline|gasoline/petrol]] or a [[napalm]]-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth [[Capillary action|wick]] held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or [[kerosene]], rather than gasoline.\n\n===Improvised mortars===\n[[File:Barrack buster feb 2010.jpg|left|thumb|[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] improvised mortar tube.]]\n[[File:Improvised-mortars-batey-haosef-1-1.jpg|thumb|Improvised mortars in Batey ha-Osef Museum, Tel Aviv, Israel.]]\n\nImprovised, or \"home-made\", mortars have been used by [[insurgency|insurgent]] groups, usually to attack fortified military installations or to terrorize civilians. They are usually constructed from heavy steel piping mounted on a steel frame. These weapons may fire standard mortar rounds, purpose made shells, re-purposed gas cylinders filled with explosives and shrapnel, or any other type of improvised explosive, incendiary or chemical munitions. These were called [[Barrack buster|\"Barrack Busters\"]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)]]. They are known as [[Hell cannon|\"Hell Cannons\"]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]], where observers have noted that they are \"wildly inaccurate\" and responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-hell-cannons-kill-300-civilians-monitoring-122622024.html |title=Syrian rebel 'hell cannons' kill 300 civilians: monitoring group |work=Reuters |agency=[[Yahoo!

In addition to being able to provide intelligence and possibly provide direct and indirect aid, doing so allows insurgent members to gain military training and skills which they would not otherwise be able to access, these members may then serve as a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] to train other insurgents, those who rise high enough may become [[agents of influence]].\n\n===Agitation===\nOften grouped together with propaganda as [[agitprop]], agitation is the use of [[agitator]]s to stir up discontent both real and imagined with the regime and to propose a course of action to right these perceived wrongs. The traditional targets of agitators have been the [[shop floor]], [[students' union]]s and the junior officer's [[Mess|mess halls]] of the military.\n\n===Assassinations===\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\n\nThe [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919\u201321 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit \u2013 [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] \u2013 for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.\n\nThis tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.\n\n[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.\n\nThe [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[State of Vietnam|Diem regime]] to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' \u2013 Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>\n\n===Bank robberies===\nBank robberies have been used by insurgents and revolutionaries in order to fund their activities, for example the [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery]], using violence in excess of that needed to achieve the aims of the robberies helps contributes to a [[Culture of fear|climate of fear]].\n\n===Group participation in atrocities===\nAs an [[initiation]] new recruits, especially forced ones, will be encouraged or forced to participate in atrocities, such as torture, rape and murder, unwilling recruits will be forced to do this against their own communities and families or be killed themselves. The goal of these atrocities is to divorce the new recruit from his or her previous life and bind them to the insurgency; criminals in their own eyes and in the eyes of society, such recruits will be led to believe that they cannot go back to their previous lives and have no other family other than the insurgency. In order to break the hold the insurgency may hold over such members, the authorities may offer amnesties and pardons for crimes committed.\n\n===Kidnapping===\nInsurgents kidnap and take hostage members of the general public for ransom in order to fund the activities of the insurgents. The kidnapping of family members may be used to coerce co-operation, the provision of information, use of a property as a safe house, a copy of a key etc. High value hostages may be taken in order to force the release of captured comrades and as media spectaculars. At all levels creating a fear of kidnapping reinforces a message that the state and its security forces cannot protect you.\n\n===Law and order===\nInsurgents may attempt to create a parallel system of  \"justice\" with punishment beatings and killings of criminals in order to ingratiate themselves with the populace. Especially in corrupt and failed regimes where there is a deficit of true justice people's and revolutionary courts aim to legitimize the insurgents as a government in waiting. This is doubly so if insurgents are seen as bringing order in failed regimes, ones with weak central control, and ones in which the security forces are as bad as would be thieves and bandits.\n\n===Propaganda===\n[[Propaganda]] is used to sell to the populace the legitimacy, morality and ability of the insurgents, whilst at the same time portraying the government and its security forces in a negative light. This propaganda can be [[Propaganda of the deed|of the deed]], spectacular acts of assassination, sabotage and violence, relying on the mass media to spread the insurgents message. If the state seeks to starve the insurgents of the \"oxygen of publicity\" the older means of disseminating the insurgents message is by [[pamphlet]]ting (e.g. [[Thomas Paine]]'s [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]) and through use of the oral tradition of stories, [[Irish rebel song|rebel]] and [[revolutionary song]]s, modern insurgents use the internet.\n\n===Sabotage===\n[[Sabotage]] against infrastructure, for example power stations, airports and reservoir at the upper end, and for example electricity pylons, substations, telephone exchanges and railway tracks at the lower end make real to the populace that an insurgency is underway; and if sustained can affect the quality of life of the populace.

He believed that reforming [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], including abolishing \"[[rotten borough]]s\", would ease the poverty of farm labourers. Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He also strongly advocated of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. His [[polemic]]s cover subjects from political reform to religion.

Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week.

It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''. He also wrote ''The American Gardener'' (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nCobbett closely observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Ronald G. Walters, ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett's arrival came soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll. That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust ''(Robinia pseudoacacia)'', and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety, he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing it, Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.  Sketch by [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]].]]\nIn 1829, Cobbett published ''Advice To Young Men'', in which he criticised ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. That year he also published ''The English Gardener'', which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Gardening''.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\">Clifford-Smith, S., \"William Cobbett: cottager's friend\", ''Australian Garden History'', 19 (5), 2008, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nCobbett continued to publish controversy in the ''Political Register'' and was charged in July 1831 with [[seditious libel]] for a pamphlet entitled ''Rural War'', endorsing the Captain [[Swing Riots]], in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 789.</ref>\n\nCobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.

Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].

Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison]].

As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, for his personal wealth and opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective \u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D.

He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Ronald G. Walters, ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett's arrival came soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]].

That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust ''(Robinia pseudoacacia)'', and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety, he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.

He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born.

Members sent petitions to Parliament demanding radical reform and produced radical pamphlets and leaflets to keep Cobbett's politics alive. Some of these are still available in libraries. The William Cobbett Society, based in Farnham, produces a yearly edition of 'Cobbett's New Register', and celebrates Cobbett's life, works and spirit in various activities, including an annual Rural Ride and lecture.\n\n{{anchor|Writings|Publications|Books}}\n\n==Works==\n<!--chronological order-->\n*{{Citation |last=Cobbett |first=William |authorlink=William Cobbett |display-authors=0 |title=A Bone to Gnaw for the Democrats |location=Philadelphia |date=1795}}, as \"Peter Porcupine\", reprinted at London in 1797.\n*{{Citation |last=Cobbett |first=William |authorlink=William Cobbett |display-authors=0 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001746911 |title=Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England from the Norman conquest in 1066 to the Year 1803, from Which Last-Mentioned Epoch It Is Continued Downwards in the Work Entitled \"Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates\" |location=London |publisher=T.C.

It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100&nbsp;million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8&nbsp;billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.   Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history.<ref name=\"Great Global CleanUp\"/><ref name=\"Earth Day 50th Anniversary\"/><ref>[https://real-leaders.com/earth-day-take-part-in-the-biggest-volunteer-event-in-history/ Earth Day: Take Part in the Biggest Volunteer Event in History]</ref>\n* Education: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide. EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change. Art must join with science to personalize climate change and disseminate it to a wider audience.<ref>[https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020/ Earth Day 50th Anniversary]</ref>\n\n==The Earth Day name==\nAccording to Nelson, the moniker \"Earth Day\" was \"an obvious and logical name\" suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both \"a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations\" and \"a New York advertising executive,\" [[Julian Koenig]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gaylord Nelson Papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Box 231, Folder 43.</ref> Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; \"Earth Day\" rhyming with \"birthday,\" the connection seemed natural.<ref name=\"tal\">{{Cite episode |title=Origin Story |url=http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |series=This American Life |airdate=June 19, 2009 |number=383 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624012919/http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.org/06nci/06/NCI25thAnniversary.htm |title=Statement by Paul Leventhal on the 25th Anniversary of the Nuclear Control Institute |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> Other names circulated during preparations\u2014Nelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was \"practically unanimous\" in its use of \"Earth Day,\" so the name stuck.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The introduction of the name \"Earth Day\" was also claimed by John McConnell (see \"Equinox Earth Day,\" below).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://environment.about.com/od/earthday/f/who-invented-earth-day.htm |title=Who invented Earth Day? |date=|accessdate=March 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Earth Day Canada==\n[[File:Paul Tinari Officially Launching the Canadian First Earth Day on September 11, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Paul Tinari officially launched the first Canadian Earth Day on September 11, 1980 \u2013 included are [[Flora MacDonald (politician)|Flora MacDonald MP]], Ken Keyes and Dr. Ronald Watts]]\nThe first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

Their organizational structure has evolved significantly over the past half-century, as internal and external threats changed.\n\nJordanian special operations forces evolved from a multi-task company-size parachute unit in the early 1960s to brigade-size in the early 1980s, with more specialized units, including a parachute unit, special forces unit and a small counter-terrorism unit.\n\nWith the beginning of this century and the emergence of new threats to national security, Jordan established paramilitary troops\u2014the Gendarmerie. The new military force was, and remains, tasked with countering homeland security threats, thus allowing the Special Operations Forces to focus on homeland defense threats. Therefore, the concept changed accordingly, from special operations to joint special operations.\n\nThe previous organization of the Royal Joint Special Operations consisted mainly of three main brigades with all standard support and service units that facilitate operations and training.\n\n* The Special Forces Brigade consists of a special forces group, a counter-terrorism battalion and a combat search-and-rescue battalion. This brigade is mainly equipped and trained to successfully fight unconventional threats, with a good capability to also face conventional ones.\n* The Rangers Brigade is more geared towards fighting conventional threats, with good capabilities to support internal security operations.\n* The Special Operations Aviation Brigade provides the joint task forces with mobility, timely response capabilities and insertion platforms, especially for the counter-terrorism teams.\n\n==Special Operations 2017 Reform==\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of JAF, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Freihat, launched a package of reforms across JAF\u2014many of which appear to be driven by budgetary constraints. The reforms included specific initiatives that have significantly changed the shape of the Jordanian special operations community.\n\nThe first measure deactivated the Joint Special Operations Command headquarters and downgraded the highest-ranking special forces commander from a major general to a colonel-rank officer.\n\nThe second measure transformed the 28th Royal Ranger Brigade out of special operations and  re-organized it as the Rapid Intervention / High Readiness Brigade\n\nThe third initiative removed the 5th Aviation Brigade from special operations and transferred it to the Jordanian air force. The brigade has been supported by the U.S. 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, which carries out quarterly reviews of their Jordanian counterparts. The level of U.S. oversight and support for this brigade has made it one of the most effective elements of the Jordanian armed forces.

Jordan has trained  to meet the needs of Arab and non-Arab countries. As an established regional centre for special forces training, Jordan has trained forces from [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Yemen]].\n\n==[[KASOTC]]==\nThe King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center ([[KASOTC]]) is indeed a one-of-a-kind facility in the region. It was conceived to be a training hub for elite forces, law enforcement and counter-terrorism operators not only in the region, but worldwide. KASOTC offers trainees a unique opportunity to gain experience and knowledge, and to interact with similar forces from other countries, which will create a pool of highly qualified professionals who can meet the challenges of cross-borders threats.\n\nThe center\u2019s instructors come from all over the world and were carefully selected in light of their very strong qualifications and solid experience, which is a tremendous asset to all those who participate in training at KASOTC.\n\n[[KASOTC]] derives extraordinary success from this unique combination of elite instructors and advanced technology. When knowledge is combined with experience, a maximizing effect occurs to skills obtained, making the KASOTC experience unique to all other training facilities. It is the only reality-based, live-fire training facility of this kind in the world. Operated as a commercial enterprise, it is uniquely integrated with the Jordanian Armed Forces. This relationship is a bold innovation; providing access to military equipment and support that expands all training horizons.\n\nLocated north of Amman, Jordan in an old rock quarry, the twenty-five (25) square kilometer facility is safe, secure and isolated. It is equipped with multiple distance ranges; from a 1300-meter unknown distance range to a 300-meter, moving target range to accommodate most firearm requirements. It has a four story, close quarters battle (CQB), live-fire structure and the largest mock city in existence, 67 buildings, which include numerous arrangements from an Afghan village to an embassy. Special battlefield effects, live fire compatible throughout, with a fiber optic network connecting the Range Operations Control Center (ROC) to the hundreds of cameras, microphones, target systems, and simulators make testing the user's creativity in tactics, techniques and procedures a reality. Together with on-site lodging, dining, gym, pro-shop, weapons/equipment rental and storage; people can easily see why KASOTC is the ideal place to do what in necessary to prepare forces for the challenges of 21st century armed conflict.\n\n==Prince Hashem School for Special Operations==\n\n'''Mission'''\n\nTo train and qualify officers and NCOs from JAF, Arab and Friendly countries on RNG/ARBN and Special Operations.\n\n'''School History'''\n\nThe school went through the following key phases in terms of organization and development\n* in 1963 The first ranger and airborne course was trained by American training team and Ranger and Airborne training wing was established in infantry school.\n* In 1970 Ranger and Airborne training wing was established in RSF.\n* In 1979 Special forces school was formed and continued to evolve until 1983, where four were formed.\n* In 1983 Four training wings (ranger, airborne, specialization and field) were established.\n* In 1995 The organization was advanced with a new battalions system and free fall center was added.\n* On 1 October 1996 the name has been modified and was called \"Joint Special Operations School.\" \n* On 24/12/2001 special operations school was renamed Prince Hashem bin Al Hussein School for Special Operations.\n* In 2017, the school transferred from special forces to Army Training Command.\n\n'''School Goals and Duties'''\n\n# The preparation and training of special operations officers on Common functions.\n# The preparation and training of joint special operations commissioned officers. \n# The preparation and training of juvenile soldiers basic training and specialist training.\n# The preparation and training of members of the armed forces through special training.\n# Training of Public security, civil defense, customs and General Intelligence personnel.\n# Training members of friendly States on rangers and paratroopers and other special forces works.\n# The training of graduates of University officers (field) in addition to the pupils and candidates from Mutah University on rangers and paratroopers.\n# Participate in the testing of new weapons and gear mechanisms and sufficiency of Joint special operations duties.\n# Conduct annual tests for units and formations Joint special operations and the armed forces.\n\n'''School Courses'''\n\n# Platoon Commander\u2019s Basic Tactics Course\n# English Language Training Course For Officers/NCO\n# Ranger Course\n# Ranger and Airborne Instruction Course\n# Airborne Course\n# Air Assault Course\n# Fighting In Built Up Areas and Internal Security\n# Hand To Hand Fighting (Sejal)\n# Marksmanship and Range Management Course\n# Special Operations Selection Course (officers and other ranks)\n# Section and Group Commanders\n# Packing And Parachute Maintenance\n# Free Fall Course\n# Jump Masters Course\n# Pathfinders Course\n# Airborne Infiltration Course\n# Strategic Reconnaissance Course\n\n==SOF Recruiting==\nEnrollment in the Jordan armed forces is on a voluntary basis, and this is obviously also true for the special operations. The first requirement for those willing to join the special operations is that they should successfully pass physical and mental fitness tests.\n\nFrom a psychological point of view, applicants are evaluated by a military psychologist in order to assess their personal and leadership traits. Then, applicants undergo a medical screening and an initial PT test. Those who make it through this preliminary selection phase are admitted to an endurance camp (boot camp) for a month of extensive training. The camp is designed to test trainees\u2019 ability to work under physical and mental stress.\n\nUpon completing the camp, recruits take ranger and parachute courses. After this second phase, they are sent to specialized courses to complete their military professional training.\n\n==Training Courses==\n\n<center> '''''Training Courses Obtained By Special Operations Operator'''''</center>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Their organizational structure has evolved significantly over the past half-century, as internal and external threats changed.\n\nJordanian special operations forces evolved from a multi-task company-size parachute unit in the early 1960s to brigade-size in the early 1980s, with more specialized units, including a parachute unit, special forces unit and a small counter-terrorism unit.\n\nWith the beginning of this century and the emergence of new threats to national security, Jordan established paramilitary troops\u2014the Gendarmerie. The new military force was, and remains, tasked with countering homeland security threats, thus allowing the Special Operations Forces to focus on homeland defense threats. Therefore, the concept changed accordingly, from special operations to joint special operations.\n\nThe previous organization of the Royal Joint Special Operations consisted mainly of three main brigades with all standard support and service units that facilitate operations and training.\n\n* The Special Forces Brigade consists of a special forces group, a counter-terrorism battalion and a combat search-and-rescue battalion. This brigade is mainly equipped and trained to successfully fight unconventional threats, with a good capability to also face conventional ones.\n* The Rangers Brigade is more geared towards fighting conventional threats, with good capabilities to support internal security operations.\n* The Special Operations Aviation Brigade provides the joint task forces with mobility, timely response capabilities and insertion platforms, especially for the counter-terrorism teams.\n\n==Special Operations 2017 Reform==\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of JAF, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Freihat, launched a package of reforms across JAF\u2014many of which appear to be driven by budgetary constraints. The reforms included specific initiatives that have significantly changed the shape of the Jordanian special operations community.\n\nThe first measure deactivated the Joint Special Operations Command headquarters and downgraded the highest-ranking special forces commander from a major general to a colonel-rank officer.\n\nThe second measure transformed the 28th Royal Ranger Brigade out of special operations and  re-organized it as the Rapid Intervention / High Readiness Brigade\n\nThe third initiative removed the 5th Aviation Brigade from special operations and transferred it to the Jordanian air force. The brigade has been supported by the U.S. 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, which carries out quarterly reviews of their Jordanian counterparts. The level of U.S. oversight and support for this brigade has made it one of the most effective elements of the Jordanian armed forces. While the brigade\u2019s aircraft and pilots now fall under air force control, It has been assigned a direct support role to the King Abdallah ll Special Forces Group.\n\nThe result of reforms is to condense a three-brigade Joint Special Operations Command down to a single army-specific group\u2014known as the King Abdullah II Royal Special Operation Forces Group\u2014with most support elements, including administration and logistics, stripped away. At the heart of the new group are the 101st and the 71st battalions, which were converted into Special Unit I\u2014special operations\u2014and Special Unit II\u2014counterterrorism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2017/11/30/443272/future-u-s-jordanian-counterterrorism-cooperation/|authors=Hardin Lang, William Wechsler, and Alia Awadallah|title=The Future of U.S.-Jordanian Counterterrorism Cooperation|website=Center for American Progress|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth initiative has seen the creation of the Directorate of Special Operations and Rapid Intervention.

It was conceived to be a training hub for elite forces, law enforcement and counter-terrorism operators not only in the region, but worldwide. KASOTC offers trainees a unique opportunity to gain experience and knowledge, and to interact with similar forces from other countries, which will create a pool of highly qualified professionals who can meet the challenges of cross-borders threats.\n\nThe center\u2019s instructors come from all over the world and were carefully selected in light of their very strong qualifications and solid experience, which is a tremendous asset to all those who participate in training at KASOTC.\n\n[[KASOTC]] derives extraordinary success from this unique combination of elite instructors and advanced technology. When knowledge is combined with experience, a maximizing effect occurs to skills obtained, making the KASOTC experience unique to all other training facilities. It is the only reality-based, live-fire training facility of this kind in the world. Operated as a commercial enterprise, it is uniquely integrated with the Jordanian Armed Forces. This relationship is a bold innovation; providing access to military equipment and support that expands all training horizons.\n\nLocated north of Amman, Jordan in an old rock quarry, the twenty-five (25) square kilometer facility is safe, secure and isolated. It is equipped with multiple distance ranges; from a 1300-meter unknown distance range to a 300-meter, moving target range to accommodate most firearm requirements. It has a four story, close quarters battle (CQB), live-fire structure and the largest mock city in existence, 67 buildings, which include numerous arrangements from an Afghan village to an embassy. Special battlefield effects, live fire compatible throughout, with a fiber optic network connecting the Range Operations Control Center (ROC) to the hundreds of cameras, microphones, target systems, and simulators make testing the user's creativity in tactics, techniques and procedures a reality. Together with on-site lodging, dining, gym, pro-shop, weapons/equipment rental and storage; people can easily see why KASOTC is the ideal place to do what in necessary to prepare forces for the challenges of 21st century armed conflict.\n\n==Prince Hashem School for Special Operations==\n\n'''Mission'''\n\nTo train and qualify officers and NCOs from JAF, Arab and Friendly countries on RNG/ARBN and Special Operations.\n\n'''School History'''\n\nThe school went through the following key phases in terms of organization and development\n* in 1963 The first ranger and airborne course was trained by American training team and Ranger and Airborne training wing was established in infantry school.\n* In 1970 Ranger and Airborne training wing was established in RSF.\n* In 1979 Special forces school was formed and continued to evolve until 1983, where four were formed.\n* In 1983 Four training wings (ranger, airborne, specialization and field) were established.\n* In 1995 The organization was advanced with a new battalions system and free fall center was added.\n* On 1 October 1996 the name has been modified and was called \"Joint Special Operations School.\" \n* On 24/12/2001 special operations school was renamed Prince Hashem bin Al Hussein School for Special Operations.\n* In 2017, the school transferred from special forces to Army Training Command.\n\n'''School Goals and Duties'''\n\n# The preparation and training of special operations officers on Common functions.\n# The preparation and training of joint special operations commissioned officers. \n# The preparation and training of juvenile soldiers basic training and specialist training.\n# The preparation and training of members of the armed forces through special training.\n# Training of Public security, civil defense, customs and General Intelligence personnel.\n# Training members of friendly States on rangers and paratroopers and other special forces works.\n# The training of graduates of University officers (field) in addition to the pupils and candidates from Mutah University on rangers and paratroopers.\n# Participate in the testing of new weapons and gear mechanisms and sufficiency of Joint special operations duties.\n# Conduct annual tests for units and formations Joint special operations and the armed forces.\n\n'''School Courses'''\n\n# Platoon Commander\u2019s Basic Tactics Course\n# English Language Training Course For Officers/NCO\n# Ranger Course\n# Ranger and Airborne Instruction Course\n# Airborne Course\n# Air Assault Course\n# Fighting In Built Up Areas and Internal Security\n# Hand To Hand Fighting (Sejal)\n# Marksmanship and Range Management Course\n# Special Operations Selection Course (officers and other ranks)\n# Section and Group Commanders\n# Packing And Parachute Maintenance\n# Free Fall Course\n# Jump Masters Course\n# Pathfinders Course\n# Airborne Infiltration Course\n# Strategic Reconnaissance Course\n\n==SOF Recruiting==\nEnrollment in the Jordan armed forces is on a voluntary basis, and this is obviously also true for the special operations.
