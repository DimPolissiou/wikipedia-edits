The village is located about nine miles (14&nbsp;km) east of the county seat of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], two miles (3&nbsp;km) southwest of the village of [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north of [[Paradise, Pennsylvania|Paradise]], and about three miles (5&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania|Bird-in-Hand]]. Though the village is little known outside its immediate area, the surrounding countryside has been portrayed in many books and magazine articles. The [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] constitute a significant cultural presence in the area of the village. [[Wendell Berry]] mentioned the town in one of his collections of essays. The population of Gordonville was 508 residents as of the 2010 census; its 17529 [[ZIP code]] includes about 4,100 individuals.\n\n==Geography==\nThere are 153 farms in [[Leacock Township, Pennsylvania|Leacock Township]]; all but seven are owned by [[Amish]] families. These small scale farms (many with small shops) dot the gently rolling and open landscape around the village. Though rural in character, Gordonville is at the edge of the metropolis: [[Keystone Corridor|Amtrak Keystone Service]] trains pass daily through the village on runs to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to the west and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]] to the east. Though there was once a train station in the center of the village, no train has officially stopped there since the 1950s. On back roads horse-drawn [[horse and buggy|buggies]] and automobiles occasionally compete for space with rollerblading Amish youth and Amish men on [[Kick scooter|scooter]]s commuting to local jobs.\n\n==History==\nGordonville is located on part of a grant of {{Convert|2300|acre|km2}} of land to the Mary Feree family by the sons of [[William Penn]]. The town resulted from the railroad that planned to pass through the area. Around 1829 land was surveyed for the [[Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad]], chartered in 1823 and again in 1826, to run between [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Columbia, Pennsylvania|Columbia]], a growing city along the [[Susquehanna River]] south of Harrisburg. Land on the south and west side of the railway route belonged to the Christian Hershey family, which was associated with the land from as early as 1709. Daniel Gordon erected the first dwelling on land now associated with the village in 1832 (some say 1834), a {{frac|2|1|2}}-story, five-bay brick farmhouse with central doorway, largely intact gallery under gable roof, with first floor windows on facade to floor. The house was inhabited by Henry Eckert in the 1880s, and is still occupied today, though divided into several apartments.\n\nEarly trains on the [[railroad]] were merely wagons, fitted to run on tracks and pulled by horses along the single track. The first U.S.-made locomotive, built at Philadelphia's [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], was produced in 1832. On 17 April 1834 the first long distance steam train ran through Gordonville along the new Columbia Railroad; the {{Convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} journey from Lancaster to Philadelphia took about eight and one half hours. Only one track was in use until October of that year; turnouts every one and a half miles allowed for passing. By 1836 Daniel Gordon had a house, a warehouse, and a storehouse on the south and west side of the railway, and the town was starting to grow. In 1857 the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] purchased Pennsylvania's [[Main Line of Public Works]], which by then included the [[Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad]] and an ambitious cross-Appalachian canal project. The nickname \"Main Line\" was affixed to the railroad route. Abraham Lincoln spoke from his train at nearby [[Leaman Place, Pennsylvania|Leaman Place]]-[[Strasburg, Pennsylvania|Strasburg]] railroad junction on 22 February 1861, only one mile east of Gordonville; over 5,000 people were present. (In 1968 Hubert H. Humphrey, candidate for president, stopped and spoke at the same place.) In 1870 two barns in Gordonville were destroyed by fire caused by locomotive sparks. The 1895 U.S. Atlas described the village of Gordonville as having a population of 413, a railroad station, post office, and express office. By 1898 the railway was widened to four tracks, and by the early twentieth century 200 trains per day passed through the town. The building of the famous (and now abandoned) low grade railway in the southern end of the Lancaster County in 1906 drastically reduced train traffic. The railway line was [[Electric locomotive|electrified]] in 1938. Later in the early twentieth century only six passenger trains and two freight trains actually made scheduled stops at Gordonville station each day. One of the freights was the morning [[milk train]]. Today the village has a population of about 460 people. [[Amtrak]] trains still travel through the town along the railway that brought about the town's birth. There is talk of a new station to be erected at Leaman Place, a mile east of Gordonville at the Strasburg RR junction, which would serve [[Amtrak]] and [[SEPTA]] trains.\n\n==Spring sale and auction==\nThe Annual Spring Sale and Auction of the Gordonville Fire Company and Ambulance Association, held the second Saturday of March, is the largest event of its kind on the East Coast. A tradition since 1969, it draws about 12,000 people (about 4,500 registered bidders) to bid on farm machinery, horses, quilts, carriages, old stuff, and antiques. When not actively buying, people socialize, tourists observe, and some Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite youth play cornerball, a traditional and \"acrobatic\" game played with a small hard ball on a field of manure, mud, and straw. Though similar ''mud sale'' auctions abound in Lancaster County in the spring, none has as many people attending. Proceeds of the sale assist the upkeep of fire equipment.\n\nOn 13 March 1993 the fire company auction was abruptly closed at 10:00 am by state police, who announced that an unseasonable snowfall would eventually block the roads, stranding people in town. Most people were gone by 11:00 am. At noon the last people to attempt to leave, a family which actively volunteered with the fire company, ambulance, and the spring sale, discovered that the roads were actually impassable. The family was compelled to spend the night with friends in town. In the next 24 hours only {{Convert|24|in|mm}} of snow fell, but 50 to 60 mile per hour winds limited visibility and caused drifting snow to block the roads. During the blizzard the fire company's ambulance crew handled several emergencies, taking people by snowmobile to [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania|Bird-in-Hand]] where, due to nearly continuous plowing, it was still possible to travel to Lancaster city by highway. Sunday morning discovered very little activity. Roads were blocked by frozen four and five feet high snow drifts until the early afternoon. The auction field contained farm machinery and over a hundred carriages buried under snow. It was at least a week before things were normal. Some called it the snowfall of the century, but just three years later on 8 January 1996 a two-foot snowfall led to all roadways in 47 [[Pennsylvania]] counties being closed by the governor's order. Perhaps the fact that the 1993 snowstorm occurred in March made it seem worse than it actually was.\n\n{{Lancaster County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Gordonville, Pennsylvania\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = [[census-designated place]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|pushpin_map              = USA Pennsylvania\n|pushpin_label   = Gordonville\n|pushpin_map_caption      = Location within the U.S. state of Pennsylvania\n|pushpin_mapsize          = \n|image_map                = \n|map_caption              = Location within Lancaster county\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Pennsylvania]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Pennsylvania|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]\n\n|subdivision_type3        = Township\n|subdivision_name3        = [[Leacock Township, Pennsylvania|Leacock]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = <!-- Mayor -->\n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         =\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref                = Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = \n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = \n|area_land_km2            = \n|area_water_km2           =\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[United States Census, 2010|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = \n|population_total         = 508\n|population_density_km2   = auto\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_ft             = \n|coordinates              = {{coord|40|1|12|N|76|8|2|W|type:landmark_region:US|display=inline,title}}\n\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -->\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 17529\n|area_code                = [[Area code 717|717]] Exchange: 768\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = \n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = \n|website                  = \n|footnotes                = \n}}\n\n'''Gordonville, Pennsylvania''', is an unincorporated place or village and [[census-designated place]] in [[Leacock Township, Pennsylvania|Leacock Township]] in eastern [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]].

The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more.

The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore is [[Grateful Dead]]'s gig at the [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Raceway Park]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey]] on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Rod Stewart]]'s show in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro, remains the highest-attended free concert with an estimated 3.5 million audience.\n\n==Highest-attended concerts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"|{{*|alt=Indicates the concert was the all-time highest attended up to that point}}\n|Indicates the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point\n|}\n\n===Single-artist concerts===\nThe following are the highest-attended single-artist's ticketed concerts (excluding [[music festival]]s) with attendance of 100,000 people or more.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Artist\n!align=left| Venue\n!

On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.<ref name=\"SidereusNuncius\" /><ref name=\"NASA\" />{{efn|name=Marius}}\n\n==Name==\nGalileo claimed the right to name the moons he'd discovered. He considered \"Cosmian Stars\" and settled on \"[[Galilean Satellites#Dedication to the Medicis|Medicean Stars]]\".<ref name=\"Naming\" />\n\nThe French astronomer [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] suggested individual names from the [[Medici]] family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up.<ref name=\"Naming\" /> [[Simon Marius]], who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites,<ref name=\"College\" /> tried to name the moons the \"Saturn of Jupiter\", the \"Jupiter of Jupiter\" (this was Ganymede), the \"Venus of Jupiter\", and the \"Mercury of Jupiter\", another nomenclature that never caught on. From a suggestion by [[Johannes Kepler]], Marius once again tried to name the moons:<ref name=\"Naming\" />\n\n{{quote|... Then there was [[Ganymede (Greek mythology)|Ganymede]], the handsome son of [[King Tros]], whom Jupiter, having taken the form of an eagle, transported to heaven on his back, as poets fabulously tell ... the Third, on account of its majesty of light, Ganymede ...<ref name=\"Discovery\" />}}\n\nThis name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, {{nowrap|Jupiter III}} (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words \"the third satellite of Jupiter\". Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter's moons.<ref name=\"Naming\" /> Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure\u2014like Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.\n\nThe Galilean satellites retain the Italian spellings of their names. In the cases of Io, Europa and Callisto, these are identical to the Latin, but the Latin form of Ganymede is ''Ganymedes''. In English, the final 'e' is silent, perhaps under the influence of French, unlike later names taken from Latin and Greek.\n\n==Orbit and rotation==\n[[File:Galilean moons around Jupiter.gif|thumb|right|Galilean moons around Jupiter {{legend2|Lime|Jupiter}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|OrangeRed|Io}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|Europa}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Gold|Ganymede}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|Callisto}}]]\n[[File:Galilean moon Laplace resonance animation 2.gif|thumb|right|[[Laplace resonance]] of Ganymede, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]] (conjunctions are highlighted by color changes)]]\n\nGanymede [[orbit]]s Jupiter at a distance of 1,070,400&nbsp;km, third among the Galilean satellites,<ref name=\"Planetary Society\" /> and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]], with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is seven days and three hours.<ref name=\"The Grand Tour\" /> Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian [[equator]], with the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]] changing [[almost periodic function|quasi-periodically]] due to solar and planetary gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009\u20130.0022 and 0.05\u20130.32\u00b0, respectively.<ref name=\"Musotto2002\" /> These orbital variations cause the [[axial tilt]] (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33\u00b0.<ref name=\"Bills2005\" />\n\nGanymede participates in [[orbital resonance]]s with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times.<ref name=\"Musotto2002\" /><ref name=\"SPACE.com\" /> [[Astronomical conjunction|Conjunctions]] (alignment on the same side of Jupiter) between Io and Europa occur when Io is at [[periapsis]] and Europa at [[apoapsis]]. Conjunctions between Europa and Ganymede occur when Europa is at periapsis.<ref name=\"Musotto2002\" /> The longitudes of the Io\u2013Europa and Europa\u2013Ganymede conjunctions change with the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the [[Laplace resonance]].<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" />\n[[File:Jupiter's Great Red Spot and Ganymede's shadow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jupiter's Great Red Spot and Ganymede's shadow<ref name=\"cwgjupgany\"/>]]\nThe current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible.<ref name=\"SPACE.com\" /> The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal [[dissipation]] in the interior of Ganymede.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low\u2014on average 0.0015<ref name=\"SPACE.com\" />\u2014[[tidal heating]] is negligible now.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances<ref name=\"laplaceres\" group=lower-alpha /> that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01\u20130.02.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Showman1997a\" />\n\nThere are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System;<ref name=\"Peale2002\" /> or that it developed after the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]]. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular [[moment (physics)|moment]] was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" /> Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.<ref name=\"Showman1997a\" />\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[Image:Noaa ganymede.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Depiction of Ganymede centered over 45\u00b0 W. longitude; dark areas are Perrine (upper) and Nicholson (lower) regiones; prominent craters are Tros (upper right) and Cisti (lower left).]]\n\n===Size===\nGanymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System.

The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface,<ref name=\"Patterson2007\" /> contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.<ref name=\"Pappalardo2001\" />\n\nThe heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the [[planetary sciences]]. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly [[tectonic]] in nature.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> [[Cryovolcano|Cryovolcanism]] is thought to have played only a minor role, if any.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice [[lithosphere]] necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the [[tidal heating]] events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable [[orbital resonance]]s.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Showman1997b\" /> The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and [[horst and graben]] faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Bland2007\" /> The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1\u20136 % due to [[phase transition]]s in ice and [[thermal expansion]].<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> During subsequent evolution deep, hot water [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plumes]] may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere.<ref name=\"Barr\" /> [[Radiogenic heat]]ing within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.<ref name=\"gra.6\" />\n\nCratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The density of cratering indicates an age of 4&nbsp;billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the [[Moon]], and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain).<ref name=\"Zahnle1998\" /> Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4&nbsp;billion years ago similar to that of the Moon.<ref name=\"Zahnle1998\" /> If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since.<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" /> Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible.<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" /><ref name=\"Ganymede\" /> Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a \"ghost\" of a crater known as a [[Palimpsest (planetary astronomy)|palimpsest]].<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" />\n\nOne significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named [[Galileo Regio]], which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.<ref name=\"Casacchia\" />\n\nGanymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40\u00b0 latitude.<ref name=\"The Grand Tour\" /> These polar caps were first seen by the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from ''Galileo'' suggests the latter is correct.<ref name=\"Polar caps\" /> The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.<ref name=\"Polar caps\" />\n{{wide image|Ganymede-JupiterMoon-GeologicMap-SIM3237-20140211.png|800px|align-cap=center|[[Geologic map]] of Ganymede (February 2014).

Layers drawn to scale.]]\nIn the 1970s, NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede has a thick ocean between two layers of ice, one on the surface and one beneath a liquid ocean and atop the rocky mantle.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"clubsandwich 2014\" /><ref name=\"Sohl2002\" /><ref name=\"Freeman2006\" /><ref name=\"amount of water in ocean\" /> In the 1990s, NASA's ''Galileo'' mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's sub-surface ocean. An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different [[phases of ice]], with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=\"clubsandwich 2014\" /><ref name=\"Vance\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20140501c\" /><ref name=\"Hubble 2015\" /> Water\u2013rock contact may be an important factor in the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]].<ref name=\"clubsandwich 2014\" /> The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800&nbsp;km to the rocky \"seafloor\") mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice\u2013water interface. In March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved over Ganymede's surface suggest it has a subsurface ocean. A large salt-water ocean affects Ganymede's magnetic field, and consequently, its aurora.<ref name=\"Ocean Hubble\"/><ref name=\"Hubble 2015\"/><ref name=\"sciencedaily1503\" /><ref name=\"sswater1\" /> The evidence suggests that Ganymede's oceans might be the largest in the entire Solar System.<ref name='Sci Am 2017'>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/overlooked-ocean-worlds-fill-the-outer-solar-system/ Overlooked Ocean Worlds Fill the Outer Solar System].

No atmosphere was revealed by the ''Voyager'' data. The upper limit on the surface particle [[number density]] was found to be {{nowrap|1.5{{E|9}} cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}, which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 \u00b5Pa (25 picobar).<ref name=\"Broadfoot1981\" /> The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.<ref name=\"Broadfoot1981\" />\n[[Image:Map of temparatureof ganymede.jpg|thumb|200px|left|False-color temperature map of Ganymede]]\nDespite the ''Voyager'' data, evidence for a tenuous [[oxygen]] atmosphere ([[exosphere]]) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], was found by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) in 1995.<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /><ref name=\"JPLAtmosphere\" /> HST actually observed [[airglow]] of [[atomic oxygen]] in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4&nbsp;nm and 135.6&nbsp;nm. Such an airglow is excited when [[molecular oxygen]] is [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] by electron impacts,<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /> which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O<sub>2</sub> molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the {{nowrap |(1.2\u20137){{E|8}} cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}} range, corresponding to the surface pressure of {{nowrap |0.2\u20131.2 \u00b5Pa}}.<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /><ref name=\"surfacedensitynumber\" group=lower-alpha /> These values are in agreement with the ''Voyager''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass.<ref name=\"JPLAtmosphere\" /> The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near \u00b1 50\u00b0 latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below).<ref name=\"Feldman2000\" /> The bright spots are probably polar [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]], caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.<ref name=\"Johnson1997\" />\n\nThe existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an [[ionosphere]] should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic [[electron]]s coming from the magnetosphere<ref name=\"Paranicas1999\" /> and by solar [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] radiation.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some ''Galileo'' measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400\u20132,500&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.\n\nAdditional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) bands was announced in 1996.<ref name=\"Noll1996\" /> In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] (or [[diatomic]]) absorption features of [[molecular oxygen]]. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], rather than on surface [[albedo]]\u2014they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O<sub>3</sub> shows an opposite trend.<ref name=\"Oxygen97\" /> Laboratory work has found that O<sub>2</sub> would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (\u2212173.15&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"sci.5320\" />\n\nA search for [[sodium]] in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles.<ref name=\"ic.126.1\" /> Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is [[atomic hydrogen]]. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000&nbsp;km from Ganymede's surface. Their density on the surface is about {{nowrap |1.5{{E|4}} cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.<ref name=\"Barth1997\" />\n\n===Magnetosphere===\n[[Image:Ganymede magnetic field.svg#Summary|thumb|Magnetic field of the Jovian satellite Ganymede, which is embedded into the magnetosphere of Jupiter.

The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176\u00b0, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> Its north pole lies below the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. The [[dipole|dipole magnetic field]] created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 \u00b1 2 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]] at Ganymede's equator,<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede\u2014about 120 nT.<ref name=\"Kivelson1997\" /> The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning [[Magnetic reconnection|reconnection]] is possible.

In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30\u00b0, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's [[ionosphere]].<ref name=\"Kivelson1998\" /> In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of [[kiloelectronvolt]]) electrons and ions have been detected,<ref name=\"Paranicas1999\" /> which may cause the [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] observed around the Ganymedian poles.<ref name=\"Feldman2000\" /> In addition, heavy ions precipitate continuously on Ganymede's polar surface, [[sputtering]] and darkening the ice.<ref name=\"Paranicas1999\" />\n\nThe interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is in many respects similar to that of the [[solar wind]] and Earth's magnetosphere.<ref name=\"Kivelson1998\" /><ref name=\"Volwerk1999\" /> The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow\u2014[[supersonic]] in the case of Earth and [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no [[bow shock]] off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.<ref name=\"Volwerk1999\" />\n\nIn addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The [[field strength]] of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT\u2014half of that of the ambient Jovian field.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high [[electrical conductivity]].<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" />\n\nGiven that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core,<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /><ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core,<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /><ref name=\"Hauck2002\" />\n\nDespite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective.<ref name=\"Bland2007\" /> Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" />\n\n===Radiation environment===\nThe radiation level at the surface of Ganymede is considerably lower than at Europa, being 50-80 mSv (5-8 rem) per day, an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for two months.<ref name= \"Podzolko\">{{cite conference |last1= Podzolko|first1= M.V.|last2= Getselev|first2= I.V.| title= Radiation Conditions of a Mission to Jupiter\u02bcs Moon Ganymede | book-title= International Colloquium and Workshop \"Ganymede Lander: Scientific Goals and Experiments | pages= | publisher= Moscow State University | date= 4\u20138 March 2013 | location= IKI, Moscow, Russia | url= https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=32688.0;attach=541277 | access-date= 2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n==Origin and evolution==\nGanymede probably formed by an [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] in Jupiter's [[solar nebula|subnebula]], a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation.<ref name=\"Canup2002\" /> The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years,<ref name=\"Mosqueira2003\" /> much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively \"gas-starved\" when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto.<ref name=\"Canup2002\" /> In contrast Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale.<ref name=\"Mosqueira2003\" /> This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]]: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core.<ref name=\"Bhatia2017\"/> In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition.<ref name=\"Freeman2006\" /><ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing<ref name=\"Showman2\" /> or more intense pummeling by impactors during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].<ref name=\"Baldwin\" /><ref name = \"Phys.Org2010\" /><ref name=\"LPI1158\" /><ref name=\"Barr3\" /> In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a [[thermal runaway|runaway process]] at Ganymede but not Callisto.<ref name=\"LPI1158\" /><ref name=\"Barr3\" />\n\nAfter formation, Ganymede's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection.<ref name=\"Freeman2006\" /> The decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, [[iron]]\u2013[[iron(II) sulfide|iron-sulfide]] core and a [[silicate]] mantle formed.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /><ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body.<ref name=\"Bhatia2017\" /> By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation.<ref name=\"Nagel2004\" /> The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice.<ref name=\"Nagel2004\" /> Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist,<ref name=\"Spohn2003\" /> whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe\u2013FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The current [[heat flux]] out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" />\n\n==Exploration==\n\n===Completed missions===\n[[File:Ganymede from Pioneer 10 19.jpg|thumb|Ganymede from ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' (1973)]]\n\nSeveral probes flying by or orbiting Jupiter have explored Ganymede more closely, including four flybys in the 1970s, and multiple passes in the 1990s to 2000s.\n\n''[[Pioneer 10]]'' approached in 1973 and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Pioneer 11\" /> and they returned information about the satellite.<ref name=\"Terraformers\" /> This included more specific determination on physical characteristics and resolving features to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} on its surface.<ref name=\"chap6\" /> Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"dmu.p10\" />\n\n''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' were next, passing by Ganymede in 1979.

On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.<ref name=\"SidereusNuncius\" /><ref name=\"NASA\" />{{efn|name=Marius}} \n\n==Name==\nGalileo claimed the right to name the moons he'd discovered. He considered \"Cosmian Stars\" and settled on \"[[Galilean Satellites#Dedication to the Medicis|Medicean Stars]]\".<ref name=\"Naming\" />\n\nThe French astronomer [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] suggested individual names from the [[Medici]] family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up.<ref name=\"Naming\" /> [[Simon Marius]], who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites,<ref name=\"College\" /> tried to name the moons the \"Saturn of Jupiter\", the \"Jupiter of Jupiter\" (this was Ganymede), the \"Venus of Jupiter\", and the \"Mercury of Jupiter\", another nomenclature that never caught on. From a suggestion by [[Johannes Kepler]], Marius once again tried to name the moons:<ref name=\"Naming\" />\n\n{{quote|... Then there was [[Ganymede (Greek mythology)|Ganymede]], the handsome son of [[King Tros]], whom Jupiter, having taken the form of an eagle, transported to heaven on his back, as poets fabulously tell ... the Third, on account of its majesty of light, Ganymede ...<ref name=\"Discovery\" />}}\n\nThis name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, {{nowrap|Jupiter III}} (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words \"the third satellite of Jupiter\". Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter's moons.<ref name=\"Naming\" /> Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure\u2014like Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.\n\nThe Galilean satellites retain the Italian spellings of their names. In the cases of Io, Europa and Callisto, these are identical to the Latin, but the Latin form of Ganymede is ''Ganymedes''.

The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface,<ref name=\"Patterson2007\" /> contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.<ref name=\"Pappalardo2001\" />\n\nThe heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the [[planetary sciences]]. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly [[tectonic]] in nature.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> [[Cryovolcano|Cryovolcanism]] is thought to have played only a minor role, if any.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice [[lithosphere]] necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the [[tidal heating]] events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable [[orbital resonance]]s.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Showman1997b\" /> The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and [[horst and graben]] faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Bland2007\" /> The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1\u20136 % due to [[phase transition]]s in ice and [[thermal expansion]].<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> During subsequent evolution deep, hot water [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plumes]] may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere.<ref name=\"Barr\" /> [[Radiogenic heat]]ing within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.<ref name=\"gra.6\" />\n\nCratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> The density of cratering indicates an age of 4&nbsp;billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the [[Moon]], and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain).<ref name=\"Zahnle1998\" /> Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4&nbsp;billion years ago similar to that of the Moon.<ref name=\"Zahnle1998\" /> If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since.<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" /> Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible.<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" /><ref name=\"Ganymede\" /> Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a \"ghost\" of a crater known as a [[Palimpsest (planetary astronomy)|palimpsest]].<ref name=\"nineplanets.org-Ganymede\" />\n\nOne significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named [[Galileo Regio]], which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.<ref name=\"Casacchia\" />\n\nGanymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40\u00b0 latitude.<ref name=\"The Grand Tour\" /> These polar caps were first seen by the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from ''Galileo'' suggests the latter is correct.<ref name=\"Polar caps\" /> The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.<ref name=\"Polar caps\" />\n{{wide image|Ganymede-JupiterMoon-GeologicMap-SIM3237-20140211.png|800px|align-cap=center|[[Geologic map]] of Ganymede (February 2014).

An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different [[phases of ice]], with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=\"clubsandwich 2014\" /><ref name=\"Vance\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20140501c\" /><ref name=\"Hubble 2015\" /> Water\u2013rock contact may be an important factor in the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]].<ref name=\"clubsandwich 2014\" /> The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800&nbsp;km to the rocky \"seafloor\") mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice\u2013water interface. In March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved over Ganymede's surface suggest it has a subsurface ocean.

No atmosphere was revealed by the ''Voyager'' data. The upper limit on the surface particle [[number density]] was found to be {{nowrap|1.5{{E|9}} cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}, which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 \u00b5Pa (25 picobar).<ref name=\"Broadfoot1981\" /> The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.<ref name=\"Broadfoot1981\" />\n[[Image:Map of temparatureof ganymede.jpg|thumb|200px|left|False-color temperature map of Ganymede]]\nDespite the ''Voyager'' data, evidence for a tenuous [[oxygen]] atmosphere ([[exosphere]]) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], was found by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) in 1995.<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /><ref name=\"JPLAtmosphere\" /> HST actually observed [[airglow]] of [[atomic oxygen]] in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4&nbsp;nm and 135.6&nbsp;nm. Such an airglow is excited when [[molecular oxygen]] is [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] by electron impacts,<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /> which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O<sub>2</sub> molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the {{nowrap |(1.2\u20137){{E|8}} cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}} range, corresponding to the surface pressure of {{nowrap |0.2\u20131.2 \u00b5Pa}}.<ref name=\"Hall1998\" /><ref name=\"surfacedensitynumber\" group=lower-alpha /> These values are in agreement with the ''Voyager''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass.<ref name=\"JPLAtmosphere\" /> The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near \u00b1 50\u00b0 latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below).<ref name=\"Feldman2000\" /> The bright spots are probably polar [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]], caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.<ref name=\"Johnson1997\" />\n\nThe existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an [[ionosphere]] should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic [[electron]]s coming from the magnetosphere<ref name=\"Paranicas1999\" /> and by solar [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] radiation.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some ''Galileo'' measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400\u20132,500&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"Eviatar2001\" /> As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.\n\nAdditional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) bands was announced in 1996.<ref name=\"Noll1996\" /> In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] (or [[diatomic]]) absorption features of [[molecular oxygen]]. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], rather than on surface [[albedo]]\u2014they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O<sub>3</sub> shows an opposite trend.<ref name=\"Oxygen97\" /> Laboratory work has found that O<sub>2</sub> would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (\u2212173.15&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"sci.5320\" />\n\nA search for [[sodium]] in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles.<ref name=\"ic.126.1\" /> Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is [[atomic hydrogen]]. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000&nbsp;km from Ganymede's surface.

The main difference is the speed of plasma flow\u2014[[supersonic]] in the case of Earth and [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no [[bow shock]] off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.<ref name=\"Volwerk1999\" />\n\nIn addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The [[field strength]] of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT\u2014half of that of the ambient Jovian field.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /> The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high [[electrical conductivity]].<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" />\n\nGiven that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core,<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /><ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /><ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core,<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.<ref name=\"Kivelson2002\" /><ref name=\"Hauck2002\" />\n\nDespite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" /> Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective.<ref name=\"Bland2007\" /> Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.<ref name=\"Showman1999\" />\n\n===Radiation environment===\nThe radiation level at the surface of Ganymede is considerably lower than at Europa, being 50-80 mSv (5-8 rem) per day, an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for two months.<ref name= \"Podzolko\">{{cite conference |last1= Podzolko|first1= M.V.|last2= Getselev|first2= I.V.| | title= Radiation Conditions of a Mission to Jupiter\u02bcs Moon Ganymede | book-title= International Colloquium and Workshop \"Ganymede Lander: Scientific Goals and Experiments | pages= | publisher= Moscow State University | date= 4-8 March 2013 | location= IKI, Moscow, Russia | url= https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=32688.0;attach=541277 | access-date= 2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n==Origin and evolution==\nGanymede probably formed by an [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] in Jupiter's [[solar nebula|subnebula]], a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation.<ref name=\"Canup2002\" /> The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years,<ref name=\"Mosqueira2003\" /> much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively \"gas-starved\" when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto.<ref name=\"Canup2002\" /> In contrast Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale.<ref name=\"Mosqueira2003\" /> This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]]: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core.<ref name=\"Bhatia2017\"/> In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition.<ref name=\"Freeman2006\" /><ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing<ref name=\"Showman2\" /> or more intense pummeling by impactors during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].<ref name=\"Baldwin\" /><ref name = \"Phys.Org2010\" /><ref name=\"LPI1158\" /><ref name=\"Barr3\" /> In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a [[thermal runaway|runaway process]] at Ganymede but not Callisto.<ref name=\"LPI1158\" /><ref name=\"Barr3\" />\n\nAfter formation, Ganymede's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection.<ref name=\"Freeman2006\" /> The decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, [[iron]]\u2013[[iron(II) sulfide|iron-sulfide]] core and a [[silicate]] mantle formed.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /><ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" /> With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body.<ref name=\"Bhatia2017\" /> By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation.<ref name=\"Nagel2004\" /> The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice.<ref name=\"Nagel2004\" /> Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist,<ref name=\"Spohn2003\" /> whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe\u2013FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation.<ref name=\"Hauk2006\" /> The current [[heat flux]] out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.<ref name=\"McKinnon2006\" />\n\n==Exploration==\n\n===Completed missions===\n[[File:Ganymede from Pioneer 10 19.jpg|thumb|Ganymede from ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' (1973)]]\n\nSeveral probes flying by or orbiting Jupiter have explored Ganymede more closely, including four flybys in the 1970s, and multiple passes in the 1990s to 2000s.\n\n''[[Pioneer 10]]'' approached in 1973 and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Pioneer 11\" /> and they returned information about the satellite.<ref name=\"Terraformers\" /> This included more specific determination on physical characteristics and resolving features to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} on its surface.<ref name=\"chap6\" /> Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"dmu.p10\" />\n\n''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' were next, passing by Ganymede in 1979.

It has followed broadly the same line since the 8th century, and in part that of [[Offa's Dyke]]; the modern boundary was fixed in 1536, when the former [[marcher lord]]ships which occupied the border area were abolished and new [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] boundaries were created.\n\nThe administrative boundary of Wales was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Whether [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] was part of Wales, or an English county treated for most purposes as though it were Welsh, was also settled by the 1972 Act, which included it in Wales.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:River Dee between Holt and Farndon.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] marking the border between [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]], England, to the left and [[Holt, Wales|Holt]], Wales, to the right]]\n\n[[File:Welcome to England bilingual.jpg|thumb|250px|Bilingual \"Welcome to England\" sign]]\nThe modern boundary between Wales and England runs from the [[salt marsh]]es of the Dee estuary adjoining the [[Wirral Peninsula]], across reclaimed land to the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] at [[Saltney]] just west of [[Chester]]. It then loops south to include within England an area southwest of Chester, before rejoining the Dee, and then loops east of the river to include within Wales a large area known as [[Maelor]], formerly an [[exclave]] of [[Flintshire]], between [[Bangor-on-Dee]] (in Wales) and [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] (in England). Returning to the River Dee as far as [[Chirk]], the boundary then loops to the west, following Offa's Dyke itself for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, and including within England the town of [[Oswestry]], before reaching the [[River Vyrnwy]] at [[Llanymynech]]. It follows the Vyrnwy to its confluence with the [[River Severn]], and then continues southwards, rising over [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Long Mountain]] east of [[Welshpool]]. East of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the boundary again follows the line of Offa's Dyke for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, before looping eastwards to include within Wales a large area near [[Churchstoke]]. It then runs westwards to the [[River Teme]], and follows the river southeastwards through [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]] before turning south towards the [[River Lugg]] at [[Presteigne]], which is within Wales.\n\nThe boundary continues southwards across hills to the [[River Wye]], and follows the river upstream for a short distance to [[Hay-on-Wye]], on the Welsh side of the border. It continues southwards and rises through and across the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], following the [[Hatterall Ridge]] past [[Llanthony]] on the Welsh side and [[Longtown, Herefordshire|Longtown]] on the English side, to reach the [[River Monnow]] near [[Pandy, Monmouthshire|Pandy]]. It then generally follows the river, past [[Pontrilas]] (in England) and [[Skenfrith]] (in Wales), towards [[Monmouth]], looping eastwards to include the town itself and a surrounding area within Wales. At [[Redbrook]], the boundary again reaches the Wye, and follows the river southwards, past [[Tintern]] and [[Chepstow]] on the Welsh side, to its confluence with the Severn at the [[Severn Bridge]]. The boundary then continues down the [[Severn estuary]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]], with the small island of [[Flat Holm]] being administered as part of Wales and the neighbouring island of [[Steep Holm]] as part of England.\n\n=== Administrative boundary ===\nThe boundary passes between [[Flintshire]], [[Wrexham County Borough]], [[Powys]], and [[Monmouthshire]] in Wales and [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] in England.\n\nThere are several places where the border runs along the centre of a lane or street, resulting in properties on one side of the street being in Wales and those on the other side being in England. Notable examples include Boundary Lane in [[Saltney]] and the main street of [[Llanymynech]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms or tribes. The modern border between England and Wales is shown in purple.]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nBefore and during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], all the native inhabitants of the island (other than the Pictish/Caledonian tribes of what is now northern Scotland\u2014and also excepting the [[Lloegyr]] of greater south-east England) spoke [[Brythonic languages]], a sub-family of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], and were regarded as [[Brythons|Britons]]. The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation. The main Roman military bases for the control of what became [[Roman Wales|Wales]] were beyond the mountains, at ''[[Deva Victrix|Deva]]'' ([[Chester]]), ''[[Viroconium]]'' ([[Wroxeter]], near [[Shrewsbury]]), and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]], near [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]), all located close to the later national border.\n\nWhen the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman garrison left]] around 410, the various parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves. The western area, later [[Wales]], had become largely Christian, and soon comprised a number of separate kingdoms, the largest being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in the northwest and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the east. Powys roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] tribe whose ''civitas'' or administrative centre during the Roman period was at ''Viroconium''. Gwynedd, at the height of its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary. Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes from the east, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.<ref name=davies>{{cite book |title= A History of Wales|last= Davies|first= John|year= 1993|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 0-14-028475-3}}</ref><ref name=rowley>{{cite book |title= The Welsh Border \u2013 archaeology, history and landscape|last= Rowley|first= Trevor|year= 1986|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1917-X}}</ref>\n\nIn the south, the Welsh [[kingdom of Gwent]] broadly covered the same area as the pre-Roman [[Silures]], traditionally the area between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]], [[River Wye|Wye]] and the Severn estuary. It was centred at different times on ''[[Venta Silurum|Venta]]'' ([[Caerwent]]), from which it derived its name, and ''Isca Augusta'' (Caerleon). Gwent generally allied with, and at various times was joined with, the smaller Welsh kingdom of [[Ergyng]], centred in present-day southern Herefordshire west of the Wye (and deriving its name from the Roman town of ''[[Ariconium]]''); and the larger kingdom of [[Glywysing]] in modern [[Glamorgan]]. The name Glywysing may indicate that it was founded by a British native of ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]).\n\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|250px|left|Peoples of southern Britain, circa 600 AD]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], circa 500, could have been fought near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] between the British, the victors, and Anglo-Saxons attempting to reach the Severn estuary, but its date and location are very uncertain and it may equally well have taken place in [[Somerset]] or [[Dorset]]. However, it is more certain that the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged in the 6th and 7th centuries in the upper [[Thames]] valley, [[Cotswolds]] and [[Hampshire]] areas. In 577, the [[Battle of Deorham]] in the southern Cotswolds was won by the Anglo-Saxons, and led to Wessex extending its control to the Severn estuary and the cities of Gloucester, [[Cirencester]], and Bath. This severed the land link between the Britons of Wales and [[Dumnonia|those of the south west peninsula]]. By about 600, however, the area of modern Gloucestershire east of the Severn, as well as most of [[Worcestershire]], was controlled by another group, the [[Hwicce]], who may have arisen from intermarriage between Anglo-Saxon and British leading families, possibly the successors to the pre-Roman [[Dobunni]]. The Hwicce came increasingly under Mercian hegemony.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, the forces of Powys and other allied Brythonic kingdoms were defeated by the [[Northumbria]]ns under [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]]. This divided the Britons of Wales from those in [[Northern England]], including [[Lancashire]], Cumbria, and [[Southern Uplands|south west Scotland]], an area which became known as ''\"Yr [[Hen Ogledd]]\"'' or \"the Old North\". Within a few decades, the Welsh became engaged in further defensive warfare against the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]], based at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] in what became the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England. The capital of Powys, [[Pengwern]], at or near modern Shrewsbury, was conquered by [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in 656 when he had become overlord of the Mercians. Powys then withdrew from the lowland areas now in southern [[Cheshire]], Shropshire and [[Herefordshire]], which became known to Welsh poets as \"The Paradise of Powys\".<ref name=davies/> The areas were occupied by Anglo-Saxon groups who became sub-kingdoms of Mercia, the ''Wreocens\u01e3te'' or [[Wrekinset]] in the northern part of what became [[Shropshire]], and the ''[[Magons\u00e6te]]'' in the southern part.<ref name=rowley/> Further south, the area north west of the Severn later known as the [[Forest of Dean]] seems to have remained in British (that is, Welsh) hands until about 760.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forest Story|last= Mansfield|first= R.J.|year= 1964}}</ref>\n\n=== Offa's Dyke ===\n[[File:Offa's Dyke near Clun.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Offa's Dyke]] near [[Clun]] in Shropshire]]\n\n{{main|Offa's Dyke}}\n\nAfter [[Ine of Wessex]] abdicated in 726, [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] established Mercia's hegemony over the Anglo-Saxons south of the [[Humber]]. However, campaigns by Powys against Mercia led to the building of [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork boundary extending from the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley near Oswestry to the Dee at [[Basingwerk]] in what became [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], perhaps to protect recently acquired lands.<ref name=davies/> After \u00c6thelbald was killed in 757, a brief civil war in Mercia then ended in victory for his distant cousin, [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. As king, he rebuilt Mercia's hegemony over the southern English through military campaigns, and also caused the construction of Offa's Dyke, around the years 770 and 780.<ref name=hill>{{cite book |title= Offa's Dyke \u2013 history and guide|last= Hill|first= David|author2=Margaret Worthington|year= 2003|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1958-7}}</ref>\n\n[[Offa's Dyke]] is a massive linear earthwork, up to {{convert|65|ft}} wide (including its surrounding ditch) and {{convert|8|ft}} high. It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer [[Asser]] wrote that Offa ''\"terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\"''. In the mid-20th century, Sir [[Cyril Fox]] completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence. More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching \"from sea to sea\", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some {{convert|64|mi}} between [[Rushock Hill]] near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, and [[Treuddyn]] in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the [[Wye valley]] and east of the Wye at [[Beachley]], may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.<ref name=hill/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm |title=The Final Word on Offa's Dyke?

By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby [[Hereford]]. The system of [[shire]]s which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century. Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand. According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son [[Edward the Elder]] also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as ''The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete'' records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in [[Archenfield]] were still culturally Welsh. It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility of making sure that the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |title=The end of the Romans and the beginning of the Saxons |author=Miranda Greene |publisher=Herefordshire Council |year=2005 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103173319/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 926, Edward's successor [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], \"King of the English\", summoned the Welsh kings including [[Hywel Dda]] of [[Deheubarth]] to a meeting at Hereford, and according to [[William of Malmesbury]] laid down the boundary between England and Wales, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.\n\nBy the mid-eleventh century, most of Wales had become united under the king of [[Gwynedd]], [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]]. In 1055, he marched on Hereford and sacked the city. He also seized [[Morgannwg]] and the Kingdom of Gwent, together with substantial territories east of Offa's Dyke, and raided as far as Chester and [[Leominster]].<ref name=rowley/> He claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales, a claim recognised by the English, and historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] states that Gruffudd was ''\"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.\"''.<ref name=davies/> However, after his most powerful ally \u2013 Earl Elfgar of Mercia and East Anglia \u2013 died, Harold and Tostig Godwinson took advantage of the situation \u2013 Gruffudd being besieged in Snowdonia \u2013 and invaded Wales. In 1063, Gruffudd was killed by his own men. Harold returned many of the Welsh princes their lands, so that after Harold's death at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Wales was again divided without a leader to resist the Normans.\n\n=== March of Wales ===\n[[File:Chepstow Castle and Bridge from Tutshill.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[River Wye]], [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|1816 road bridge]] and [[Chepstow Castle|castle]] at [[Chepstow]]. The river forms the boundary between [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] (left) and [[Gloucestershire]], England (right)]]{{main|Welsh Marches}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], King [[William I of England|William]] installed one of his most trusted confidants, [[William FitzOsbern]], as Earl of Hereford. By 1071 he had started the building of [[Chepstow Castle]], the first castle in Britain built of stone, near the mouth of the Wye. It served as a base from which the Normans continued to expand westward into [[south Wales]], establishing a castle at Caerleon and extinguishing the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. William also installed [[Roger de Montgomerie]] at Shrewsbury, and [[Hugh d'Avranches]] at Chester, creating a new expansionist [[Marcher lord|earldom]] in each case. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Norman lands are recorded west of the Wye at Chepstow and [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] in the [[Gwent Levels]] ({{lang-cy|Gwent Is-coed}}); over the whole of north east Wales as far west as the [[River Clwyd]], an area known to the Welsh as the ''[[Perfeddwlad]]''; and west of Offa's Dyke, especially in Powys where a new castle was named, after its lord, Montgomery.<ref name=davies/>\n\n[[Domesday Book]] no doubt records the extent of English penetration into Wales. This suggests that Offa's Dyke still approximately represented the boundary between England and Wales. However, during the [[The Anarchy|anarchy of Stephen]] various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including [[Whittington, Shropshire]] (see [[Whittington Castle]]) and [[Maelor|Maelor Saesneg]], hitherto in England. These lands were brought under English lordship by [[Henry II of England]], but became [[Marcher lord]]ships, and so part of Wales. This involved a loss of direct rule by the English crown.<ref>P. Brown, P King and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: the marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family' ''Shropshire Archaeology and History'' LXXIX (2004), 106\u20138.</ref>\n\nOver the next four centuries, Norman lords established mostly small lordships, at times numbering over 150, between the Dee and Severn and further west. The precise dates and means of formation of the lordships varied, as did their size. Hundreds of small castles, mostly of the [[motte and bailey]] type, were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries, predominantly by Norman lords as assertions of power as well as defences against Welsh raiders and rebels. Many new towns were established across the area, some such as Chepstow, [[Monmouth]], [[Ludlow]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] becoming successful trading centres, and these tended to be a focus of English settlement. However, the Welsh continued to attack English soil and supported rebellions against the Normans.<ref name=davies/><ref name=rowley/>\n\n[[File:CymruLlywelyn.PNG|left|thumb|230px|Wales {{circa|1217}}.

Both the [[Kingdom of England]], and also Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales, are shown in green.]]\n\nThe [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], or ''Marchia Wallia'', were to a greater or lesser extent independent of both the English monarchy and the [[Principality of Wales]], which remained based in Gwynedd in the north west of the country. By the early 12th century, they covered the areas which would later become [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and much of [[Flintshire]], Montgomeryshire, [[Radnorshire]], Brecknockshire, [[Glamorgan]], Carmarthenshire and [[Pembrokeshire]]. Some of the lordships, such as Oswestry, [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]], [[Clun]], and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] had been part of England at the time of Domesday, while others such as [[Powys Wenwynwyn|the Lordship of Powys]] were Welsh principalities that passed by marriage into the hands of Norman barons. In ecclesiastical terms, the ancient [[diocese]]s of [[Bishop of Bangor|Bangor]] and [[Diocese of St Asaph|St. Asaph]] in the north, and [[Diocese of St David's|St. David's]] and [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] in the south, collectively defined an area which included both the Principality and the March, and coincided closely with later definitions of Wales.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Principality of Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Tywysogaeth Cymru}}) covered the lands ruled by the [[Prince of Wales]] directly, and was formally founded in 1216, and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Prince of Gwynedd]], and King [[John of England]]. Encompassing two-thirds of modern Wales, the principality operated as an effectively independent entity from the reign of Llywelyn until 1283 (though it underwent a period of contraction during the early part of the reign of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] in the 1240s, and again for several years from the beginning of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s rule in 1246). Its independence was characterised by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of ''[[Welsh Law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'', and by the increasingly sophisticated [[Curia Regis|court]] of the [[Aberffraw]] dynasty.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the conquest of the Principality by [[Edward I of England]]. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches|Council of Wales]], based at [[Ludlow Castle]], was also established in the 15th century to govern the area.\n\n=== Formation of \"England and Wales\" and county boundaries ===\n{{main|Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542}}\n\nHowever, the Marches remained outside the shire system, and at least nominally outside the control of the English monarchy, until the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] was introduced in 1535 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. This, and a further Act in 1542, had the effect of annexing Wales to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and creating a single state and legal [[jurisdiction]], commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]]. The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas formed into new counties, or amalgamated into existing ones.\n\nAt this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed. In the border areas, five new counties were created \u2013 Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire \u2013 and Flintshire gained some additional territory. However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, [[Caus Castle|Caus]] and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]], [[Huntington, Herefordshire|Huntington]], [[Clifford, Herefordshire|Clifford]] and most of [[Ewyas]] were included in Herefordshire. According to John Davies:<ref name=davies/>\n\n<blockquote>Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as ''Cambria irredenta''. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.</blockquote>\n\nAn 1844 Act of Parliament later abolished several [[enclave]]s. One of these, [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.\n\n=== Monmouthshire ===\n{{main|Monmouthshire (historic)}}\n\nAlthough Monmouthshire was included in the 16th century legislation, it was treated anomalously, with the result that its legal status as a Welsh county fell into some ambiguity and doubt until the 20th century.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_monmouth.shtml |title=Monmouthshire |publisher=BBC |date=August 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> It was omitted from the second Act of Union, which established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]], and like English shires it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]], rather than one as elsewhere in Wales. However, in ecclesiastical terms, almost all of the county remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]], and most of its residents at the time spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. In the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]], following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], it gradually \"came to be regarded as an English county\".<ref name=eb1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Monmouthshire |volume=18 |page=729}}</ref> Under that interpretation, the boundary between England and Wales passed down the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney valley]], along Monmouthshire's western borders with Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, so including [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and other industrialised parts of what would now generally be considered to be [[South Wales]], within England.\n\nThe 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but noted that \"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire\". Some legislation and UK government decisions, such as the establishment of a \"Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire\" in 1908,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Archives: Welsh Office|url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=18 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119193059/http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|archivedate=19 November 2007}}</ref> referred to \"Wales and Monmouthshire\", so that it was treated as one with Wales rather than as a legal part of Wales. The county's status continued to be a matter of debate in Parliament, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century. In 1921 the area was included within the [[Church in Wales]]. The [[Welsh Office]], established in 1966, included Monmouthshire within its remit, and in 1969 [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]], proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. The issue was finally clarified in law by the [[Local Government Act 1972]],<ref name=bbc/> which provided that \"in every act passed on or after 1 April 1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) \"Wales\", subject to any alterations of boundaries...\" included \"the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport\".<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), sections 1, 20 and 269</ref> The legal boundary between England and Wales therefore passes along Monmouthshire's eastern boundaries with [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], essentially along the [[River Monnow]] and [[River Wye]].\n\n==The border today==\n[[File:Severn Aerial.jpg|thumb|Looking [[southwest]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]] with England on the left and Wales on the right.

It has followed broadly the same line since the 8th century, and in part that of [[Offa's Dyke]]; the modern boundary was fixed in 1536, when the former [[marcher lord]]ships which occupied the border area were abolished and new [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] boundaries were created.\n\nThe administrative boundary of Wales was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Whether [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] was part of Wales, or an English county treated for most purposes as though it were Welsh, was also settled by the 1972 Act, which included it in Wales.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:River Dee between Holt and Farndon.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] marking the border between [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]], England, to the left and [[Holt, Wales|Holt]], Wales, to the right]]\n\n[[File:Welcome to England bilingual.jpg|thumb|250px|Bilingual \"Welcome to England\" sign]]\nThe modern boundary between Wales and England runs from the [[salt marsh]]es of the Dee estuary adjoining the [[Wirral Peninsula]], across reclaimed land to the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] at [[Saltney]] just west of [[Chester]]. It then loops south to include within England an area southwest of Chester, before rejoining the Dee, and then loops east of the river to include within Wales a large area known as [[Maelor]], formerly an [[exclave]] of [[Flintshire]], between [[Bangor-on-Dee]] (in Wales) and [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] (in England). Returning to the River Dee as far as [[Chirk]], the boundary then loops to the west, following Offa's Dyke itself for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, and including within England the town of [[Oswestry]], before reaching the [[River Vyrnwy]] at [[Llanymynech]]. It follows the Vyrnwy to its confluence with the [[River Severn]], and then continues southwards, rising over [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Long Mountain]] east of [[Welshpool]]. East of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the boundary again follows the line of Offa's Dyke for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, before looping eastwards to include within Wales a large area near [[Churchstoke]]. It then runs westwards to the [[River Teme]], and follows the river southeastwards through [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]] before turning south towards the [[River Lugg]] at [[Presteigne]], which is within Wales.\n\nThe boundary continues southwards across hills to the [[River Wye]], and follows the river upstream for a short distance to [[Hay-on-Wye]], on the Welsh side of the border. It continues southwards and rises through and across the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], following the [[Hatterall Ridge]] past [[Llanthony]] on the Welsh side and [[Longtown, Herefordshire|Longtown]] on the English side, to reach the [[River Monnow]] near [[Pandy, Monmouthshire|Pandy]]. It then generally follows the river, past [[Pontrilas]] (in England) and [[Skenfrith]] (in Wales), towards [[Monmouth]], looping eastwards to include the town itself and a surrounding area within Wales. At [[Redbrook]], the boundary again reaches the Wye, and follows the river southwards, past [[Tintern]] and [[Chepstow]] on the Welsh side, to its confluence with the Severn at the [[Severn Bridge]]. The boundary then continues down the [[Severn estuary]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]], with the small island of [[Flat Holm]] being administered as part of Wales and the neighbouring island of [[Steep Holm]] as part of England.\n\n=== Administrative boundary ===\nThe boundary passes between [[Flintshire]], [[Wrexham County Borough]], [[Powys]], and [[Monmouthshire]] in Wales and [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] in England.\n\nThere are several places where the border runs along the centre of a lane or street, resulting in properties on one side of the street being in Wales and those on the other side being in England. Notable examples include Boundary Lane in [[Saltney]] and the main street of [[Llanymynech]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms or tribes. The modern border between England and Wales is shown in purple.]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nBefore and during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], all the native inhabitants of the island (other than the Pictish/Caledonian tribes of what is now northern Scotland\u2014and also excepting the [[Lloegyr]] of greater south-east England) spoke [[Brythonic languages]], a sub-family of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], and were regarded as [[Brythons|Britons]]. The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation. The main Roman military bases for the control of what became [[Roman Wales|Wales]] were beyond the mountains, at ''[[Deva Victrix|Deva]]'' ([[Chester]]), ''[[Viroconium]]'' ([[Wroxeter]], near [[Shrewsbury]]), and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]], near [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]), all located close to the later national border.\n\nWhen the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman garrison left]] around 410, the various parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves. The western area, later [[Wales]], had become largely Christian, and soon comprised a number of separate kingdoms, the largest being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in the northwest and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the east. Powys roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] tribe whose ''civitas'' or administrative centre during the Roman period was at ''Viroconium''. Gwynedd, at the height of its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary. Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes from the east, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.<ref name=davies>{{cite book |title= A History of Wales|last= Davies|first= John|year= 1993|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 0-14-028475-3}}</ref><ref name=rowley>{{cite book |title= The Welsh Border \u2013 archaeology, history and landscape|last= Rowley|first= Trevor|year= 1986|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1917-X}}</ref>\n\nIn the south, the Welsh [[kingdom of Gwent]] broadly covered the same area as the pre-Roman [[Silures]], traditionally the area between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]], [[River Wye|Wye]] and the Severn estuary. It was centred at different times on ''[[Venta Silurum|Venta]]'' ([[Caerwent]]), from which it derived its name, and ''Isca Augusta'' (Caerleon). Gwent generally allied with, and at various times was joined with, the smaller Welsh kingdom of [[Ergyng]], centred in present-day southern Herefordshire west of the Wye (and deriving its name from the Roman town of ''[[Ariconium]]''); and the larger kingdom of [[Glywysing]] in modern [[Glamorgan]]. The name Glywysing may indicate that it was founded by a British native of ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]).\n\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|250px|left|Peoples of southern Britain, circa 600 AD]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], circa 500, could have been fought near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] between the British, the victors, and Anglo-Saxons attempting to reach the Severn estuary, but its date and location are very uncertain and it may equally well have taken place in [[Somerset]] or [[Dorset]]. However, it is more certain that the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged in the 6th and 7th centuries in the upper [[Thames]] valley, [[Cotswolds]] and [[Hampshire]] areas. In 577, the [[Battle of Deorham]] in the southern Cotswolds was won by the Anglo-Saxons, and led to Wessex extending its control to the Severn estuary and the cities of Gloucester, [[Cirencester]], and Bath. This severed the land link between the Britons of Wales and [[Dumnonia|those of the south west peninsula]]. By about 600, however, the area of modern Gloucestershire east of the Severn, as well as most of [[Worcestershire]], was controlled by another group, the [[Hwicce]], who may have arisen from intermarriage between Anglo-Saxon and British leading families, possibly the successors to the pre-Roman [[Dobunni]]. The Hwicce came increasingly under Mercian hegemony.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, the forces of Powys and other allied Brythonic kingdoms were defeated by the [[Northumbria]]ns under [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]]. This divided the Britons of Wales from those in [[Northern England]], including [[Lancashire]], Cumbria, and [[Southern Uplands|south west Scotland]], an area which became known as ''\"Yr [[Hen Ogledd]]\"'' or \"the Old North\". Within a few decades, the Welsh became engaged in further defensive warfare against the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]], based at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] in what became the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England. The capital of Powys, [[Pengwern]], at or near modern Shrewsbury, was conquered by [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in 656 when he had become overlord of the Mercians. Powys then withdrew from the lowland areas now in southern [[Cheshire]], Shropshire and [[Herefordshire]], which became known to Welsh poets as \"The Paradise of Powys\".<ref name=davies/> The areas were occupied by Anglo-Saxon groups who became sub-kingdoms of Mercia, the ''Wreocens\u01e3te'' or [[Wrekinset]] in the northern part of what became [[Shropshire]], and the ''[[Magons\u00e6te]]'' in the southern part.<ref name=rowley/> Further south, the area north west of the Severn later known as the [[Forest of Dean]] seems to have remained in British (that is, Welsh) hands until about 760.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forest Story|last= Mansfield|first= R.J.|year= 1964}}</ref>\n\n=== Offa's Dyke ===\n[[File:Offa's Dyke near Clun.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Offa's Dyke]] near [[Clun]] in Shropshire]]\n\n{{main|Offa's Dyke}}\n\nAfter [[Ine of Wessex]] abdicated in 726, [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] established Mercia's hegemony over the Anglo-Saxons south of the [[Humber]]. However, campaigns by Powys against Mercia led to the building of [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork boundary extending from the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley near Oswestry to the Dee at [[Basingwerk]] in what became [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], perhaps to protect recently acquired lands.<ref name=davies/> After \u00c6thelbald was killed in 757, a brief civil war in Mercia then ended in victory for his distant cousin, [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. As king, he rebuilt Mercia's hegemony over the southern English through military campaigns, and also caused the construction of Offa's Dyke, around the years 770 and 780.<ref name=hill>{{cite book |title= Offa's Dyke \u2013 history and guide|last= Hill|first= David|author2=Margaret Worthington|year= 2003|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1958-7}}</ref>\n\n[[Offa's Dyke]] is a massive linear earthwork, up to {{convert|65|ft}} wide (including its surrounding ditch) and {{convert|8|ft}} high. It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer [[Asser]] wrote that Offa ''\"terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\"''. In the mid-20th century, Sir [[Cyril Fox]] completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence. More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching \"from sea to sea\", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some {{convert|64|mi}} between [[Rushock Hill]] near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, and [[Treuddyn]] in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the [[Wye valley]] and east of the Wye at [[Beachley]], may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.<ref name=hill/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm |title=The Final Word on Offa's Dyke?

By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby [[Hereford]]. The system of [[shire]]s which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century. Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand. According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son [[Edward the Elder]] also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as ''The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete'' records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in [[Archenfield]] were still culturally Welsh. It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility of making sure that the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |title=The end of the Romans and the beginning of the Saxons |author=Miranda Greene |publisher=Herefordshire Council |year=2005 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103173319/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 926, Edward's successor [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], \"King of the English\", summoned the Welsh kings including [[Hywel Dda]] of [[Deheubarth]] to a meeting at Hereford, and according to [[William of Malmesbury]] laid down the boundary between England and Wales, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.\n\nBy the mid-eleventh century, most of Wales had become united under the king of [[Gwynedd]], [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]]. In 1055, he marched on Hereford and sacked the city. He also seized [[Morgannwg]] and the Kingdom of Gwent, together with substantial territories east of Offa's Dyke, and raided as far as Chester and [[Leominster]].<ref name=rowley/> He claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales, a claim recognised by the English, and historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] states that Gruffudd was ''\"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.\"''.<ref name=davies/> However, after his most powerful ally \u2013 Earl Elfgar of Mercia and East Anglia \u2013 died, Harold and Tostig Godwinson took advantage of the situation \u2013 Gruffudd being besieged in Snowdonia \u2013 and invaded Wales. In 1063, Gruffudd was killed by his own men. Harold returned many of the Welsh princes their lands, so that after Harold's death at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Wales was again divided without a leader to resist the Normans.\n\n=== March of Wales ===\n[[File:Chepstow Castle and Bridge from Tutshill.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[River Wye]], [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|1816 road bridge]] and [[Chepstow Castle|castle]] at [[Chepstow]]. The river forms the boundary between [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] (left) and [[Gloucestershire]], England (right)]]{{main|Welsh Marches}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], King [[William I of England|William]] installed one of his most trusted confidants, [[William FitzOsbern]], as Earl of Hereford. By 1071 he had started the building of [[Chepstow Castle]], the first castle in Britain built of stone, near the mouth of the Wye. It served as a base from which the Normans continued to expand westward into [[south Wales]], establishing a castle at Caerleon and extinguishing the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. William also installed [[Roger de Montgomerie]] at Shrewsbury, and [[Hugh d'Avranches]] at Chester, creating a new expansionist [[Marcher lord|earldom]] in each case. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Norman lands are recorded west of the Wye at Chepstow and [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] in the [[Gwent Levels]] ({{lang-cy|Gwent Is-coed}}); over the whole of north east Wales as far west as the [[River Clwyd]], an area known to the Welsh as the ''[[Perfeddwlad]]''; and west of Offa's Dyke, especially in Powys where a new castle was named, after its lord, Montgomery.<ref name=davies/>\n\n[[Domesday Book]] no doubt records the extent of English penetration into Wales. This suggests that Offa's Dyke still approximately represented the boundary between England and Wales. However, during the [[The Anarchy|anarchy of Stephen]] various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including [[Whittington, Shropshire]] (see [[Whittington Castle]]) and [[Maelor|Maelor Saesneg]], hitherto in England. These lands were brought under English lordship by [[Henry II of England]], but became [[Marcher lord]]ships, and so part of Wales. This involved a loss of direct rule by the English crown.<ref>P. Brown, P King and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: the marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family' ''Shropshire Archaeology and History'' LXXIX (2004), 106\u20138.</ref>\n\nOver the next four centuries, Norman lords established mostly small lordships, at times numbering over 150, between the Dee and Severn and further west. The precise dates and means of formation of the lordships varied, as did their size. Hundreds of small castles, mostly of the [[motte and bailey]] type, were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries, predominantly by Norman lords as assertions of power as well as defences against Welsh raiders and rebels. Many new towns were established across the area, some such as Chepstow, [[Monmouth]], [[Ludlow]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] becoming successful trading centres, and these tended to be a focus of English settlement. However, the Welsh continued to attack English soil and supported rebellions against the Normans.<ref name=davies/><ref name=rowley/>\n\n[[File:CymruLlywelyn.PNG|left|thumb|230px|Wales {{circa|1217}}. Yellow: areas directly ruled by [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]; Grey: areas ruled by Llywelyn's vassals. Both the [[Kingdom of England]], and also Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales, are shown in green.]]\n\nThe [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], or ''Marchia Wallia'', were to a greater or lesser extent independent of both the English monarchy and the [[Principality of Wales]], which remained based in Gwynedd in the north west of the country. By the early 12th century, they covered the areas which would later become [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and much of [[Flintshire]], Montgomeryshire, [[Radnorshire]], Brecknockshire, [[Glamorgan]], Carmarthenshire and [[Pembrokeshire]]. Some of the lordships, such as Oswestry, [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]], [[Clun]], and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] had been part of England at the time of Domesday, while others such as [[Powys Wenwynwyn|the Lordship of Powys]] were Welsh principalities that passed by marriage into the hands of Norman barons. In ecclesiastical terms, the ancient [[diocese]]s of [[Bishop of Bangor|Bangor]] and [[Diocese of St Asaph|St. Asaph]] in the north, and [[Diocese of St David's|St. David's]] and [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] in the south, collectively defined an area which included both the Principality and the March, and coincided closely with later definitions of Wales.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Principality of Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Tywysogaeth Cymru}}) covered the lands ruled by the [[Prince of Wales]] directly, and was formally founded in 1216, and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Prince of Gwynedd]], and King [[John of England]]. Encompassing two-thirds of modern Wales, the principality operated as an effectively independent entity from the reign of Llywelyn until 1283 (though it underwent a period of contraction during the early part of the reign of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] in the 1240s, and again for several years from the beginning of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s rule in 1246). Its independence was characterised by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of ''[[Welsh Law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'', and by the increasingly sophisticated [[Curia Regis|court]] of the [[Aberffraw]] dynasty.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the conquest of the Principality by [[Edward I of England]]. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches|Council of Wales]], based at [[Ludlow Castle]], was also established in the 15th century to govern the area.\n\n=== Formation of \"England and Wales\" and county boundaries ===\n{{main|Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542}}\n\nHowever, the Marches remained outside the shire system, and at least nominally outside the control of the English monarchy, until the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] was introduced in 1535 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. This, and a further Act in 1542, had the effect of annexing Wales to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and creating a single state and legal [[jurisdiction]], commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]]. The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas formed into new counties, or amalgamated into existing ones.\n\nAt this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed. In the border areas, five new counties were created \u2013 Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire \u2013 and Flintshire gained some additional territory. However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, [[Caus Castle|Caus]] and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]], [[Huntington, Herefordshire|Huntington]], [[Clifford, Herefordshire|Clifford]] and most of [[Ewyas]] were included in Herefordshire. According to John Davies:<ref name=davies/>\n\n<blockquote>Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as ''Cambria irredenta''. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.</blockquote>\n\nAn 1844 Act of Parliament later abolished several [[enclave]]s. One of these, [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.\n\n=== Monmouthshire ===\n{{main|Monmouthshire (historic)}}\n\nAlthough Monmouthshire was included in the 16th century legislation, it was treated anomalously, with the result that its legal status as a Welsh county fell into some ambiguity and doubt until the 20th century.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_monmouth.shtml |title=Monmouthshire |publisher=BBC |date=August 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> It was omitted from the second Act of Union, which established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]], and like English shires it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]], rather than one as elsewhere in Wales. However, in ecclesiastical terms, almost all of the county remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]], and most of its residents at the time spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. In the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]], following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], it gradually \"came to be regarded as an English county\".<ref name=eb1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Monmouthshire |volume=18 |page=729}}</ref> Under that interpretation, the boundary between England and Wales passed down the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney valley]], along Monmouthshire's western borders with Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, so including [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and other industrialised parts of what would now generally be considered to be [[South Wales]], within England.\n\nThe 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but noted that \"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire\". Some legislation and UK government decisions, such as the establishment of a \"Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire\" in 1908,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Archives: Welsh Office|url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=18 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119193059/http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|archivedate=19 November 2007}}</ref> referred to \"Wales and Monmouthshire\", so that it was treated as one with Wales rather than as a legal part of Wales. The county's status continued to be a matter of debate in Parliament, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century.

It inherited the infrastructure of two separate streetcar operators: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR). The TTC immediately embarked on a program to connect the TRC and TCR lines into one network. The TTC had to rebuild most of the track to provide a wider devilstrip so that the wider [[Peter Witt (Toronto streetcar)|Peter Witt streetcars]] it was ordering could pass without sideswiping.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=19}} Between 1938 and 1945, it placed five orders for air-electric PCC streetcars to replace the old, wooden streetcars of the TRC, and to address rising ridership. Between 1947 and 1951, the TTC placed three orders for all-electric PCC cars, with one order equipped with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1950 and 1957, the TTC purchased PCCs from four American cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Birmingham and Kansas City). By 1957, the TTC (later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] in 1954) had more PCCs than any other city in North America. After the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966, the TTC considered terminating all streetcar service in Toronto. However, in 1972, a citizens group called Streetcars for Toronto persuaded the City to retain streetcar operation.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-02\" /> This led to the development of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) and its longer, articulated cousin, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), to replace the aging PCC fleet. The ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005]]'' (AODA) mandated that the next generation of streetcars be wheelchair-accessible. Thus, to replace the CLRVs and ALRVs, Bombardier adapted its low-floor [[Flexity Outlook]] model [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|for the TTC]] to navigate the Toronto streetcar system's tight curves and single-point switches, characteristics set in the 1920s to accommodate Peter Witt streetcars.\n\n== Inherited streetcars ==\nWhen the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created in 1921, it inherited the facilities of its two predecessor companies: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR).\n\n===Ex-TRC streetcars===\n[[File:TTC (ex-TRC) streetcar -1934 at College & Spadina.jpg|thumb|Class BB ex-TRC streetcar at College & Spadina in December 1925]]\nThe Toronto Transportation Commission inherited 830 streetcars from the Toronto Railway Company. However, the TTC found that only 351 of them were worth retaining; thus, the TTC disposed of the remaining 479 by 1924. (Two of the disposed cars were relics \u2013 [[horsecar]] 64, built in 1879, and streetcar 306, built in 1892 \u2013 both ultimately sent to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]] in Ottawa.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe 351 streetcars the TTC chose to retain were single-ended streetcars built between 1906 and 1917 in the TRC's own shops. They were all even-numbered and retained their original TRC car numbers. The TTC modified these streetcars and reclassified them into four classes by sets of features.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe A- and A1-class cars were operated from the mid-1920s as six-motor trains with an A1-class (4-motor) car leading a coupled A-class (2-motor) car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=28}} These trains required a crew of three, two for the lead car and another for the trailing car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}} Six-motor trains lasted until 1933 when the A-class cars were retired due to a decline of ridership during the [[Great Depression]]. After the retirement of the A-class cars, the A1-class cars would pull a Class N or Q trailer until 1934.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=53}}\n\nThe Class C cars had a Tomlinson coupler to pull a Class N or Q trailer, which in later years would be semi-permanently attached. The Class C cars were retired in 1949. The trailers were then reassigned.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=77}} Class C-1 was a variation of Class C omitting the coupler. These cars required a 2-man crew.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nThe Class BB class was the largest group of ex-TRC cars. Twenty BB-class cars were transferred to other cities during World War II: 5 to Fort William, 10 to Ottawa and 5 to Quebec City.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=65}} The Class BB cars were the last of the ex-TRC cars to be retired, the last forty being retired in 1951. Class BB car 1326 is preserved at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] museum.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=79}} These cars required a crew of one.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nBetween 1923 and 1933, the TTC modified all of its ex-TRC cars, at least once, often twice and in one case (1328) three times, each time converting the car from one class to another. A common second conversion was from C or C1 (2-man operation) to BB class (1-man operation). All C1 cars and many C-class cars were converted to BB-class by 1933. The following tables reflect the classes of retained ex-TRC streetcars after the final modification.

The new cars were wider than the older TRC cars, and the [[devilstrip]] between parallel tracks was too narrow at {{convert|3|ft|10|in}}. The TTC had to relay track throughout the system to widen the devil strip to {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=17}}\n\nThe Peter Witt streetcars, the first all-steel streetcars in Toronto, came in two versions: Large and small. The large Witts were {{convert|51|ft|10|in}} long and had 60 seats; the small Witts, {{convert|47|ft|m}} long and 55 seats. The large Witts had a slow speed but the strength to pull a trailer. The small Witts were faster in operation, could move along better in traffic but could not pull a trailer. Trailer-trains were used on heavily traveled routes such as [[Yonge streetcar line|Yonge]], [[Bloor streetcar line|Bloor]], College and Dundas.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=43}}\n\nA streetcar gets a \"Peter Witt\" designation if it was built using the Peter Witt fare payment design. With Peter Witt streetcars, passengers enter by the front doors and pay their fare as they walk past the conductor seated just before centre doors. Passengers must pay their fare when they pass the conductor either to exit the car by the centre doors or to access the rear of the car. This scheme was dubbed \"pay-as-you-pass\". Passengers could ride in the unpaid front portion of the car or in the paid rear portion.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=12}} During the Great Depression, many Witt cars were converted to one-man operation eliminating the conductor's position and relocating the fare box at the car's entrance.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=17}}\n\nThe \"Peter Witt\" trailers were not of the Peter Witt design because of their door arrangement. The Class N trailers had two narrow centre doors flanking the conductor's position, and were slow to load and unload. Thus, the three-door Class Q trailers (also known as Harvey trailers) were introduced with a double door on one side of the conductor's position and a single, narrow door on the other side.

The TTC bought these cars to replace the [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] cars and older vehicles inherited from the Toronto Railway Company. The TTC's first purchase was in 1938, and by the end of the 1950s, they operated a larger fleet of PCCs than any other agency in the world with 744 cars in service.\n\nThe TTC purchased 745 PCC streetcars in all, 317 air-electric (with air-compressor) and 428 all-electric (no air-compressor), 540 new and 205 used (from [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|several U.S. operators abandoning streetcar service]]). 175 PCCs had couplers for multiple-unit operation, and the TTC used them to assemble two-car PCC trains. (The TTC had only a maximum of 744 PCCs in service because PCC 4063 was scrapped after it derailed and crashed into a carhouse wall in 1947.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=71}}\n\nIn 1963, with the opening of the University subway (part of today's Line 1 Yonge\u2013University) and the closure of the Dupont streetcar route, the last of the Peter Witt streetcars were retired resulting in a 100% PCC streetcar fleet.\n\nThe first major retirement of PCCs occurred with the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966. The heavily used Bloor streetcar line (where two-car PCC trains ran) plus four intersecting streetcar routes (Coxwell, [[Harbord streetcar line|Harbord]], Parliament, [[511 Bathurst#History|Fort]]) were abandoned. The all-electric PCCs from the Bloor route were moved elsewhere displacing the older air-electric cars, many of which were sold to [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=117,114}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, as CLRVs were replacing the ageing PCC fleet, the TTC started to create a new class of PCC cars (class A15) by rebuilding A8-class cars. By 1992, it had rebuilt 19 PCCs for use on the new Harbourfront streetcar line (part of today's [[509 Harbourfront]] service). However, in 1995, the A15 class PCCs were retired because the CLRV fleet could handle the ridership, which had declined by that time. The TTC retained A15-class PCCs 4500 and 4549 for excursions and special events.<ref name=\"TT-4509\" />\n\nThe following PCC streetcars made up the TTC fleet:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=161}}<ref name=\"TT-4507\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The UTDC hoped to sell CLRVs, or variations of it, to other streetcar and light rail systems in North America. Subsequently, in the 1980s, the UTDC developed the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), the longer, articulated version of the CLRV.\n\nThe first six CLRVs (4000\u20134005, class L1) were built by [[Sig Holding AG|Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (Swiss Industrial Company, SIG), and were tested in Switzerland serving as prototypes. The remaining 190 CLRVs (4010\u20134199, class L2) were built by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] Limited in [[Thunder Bay]].<ref name=\"BlogTO2014-02-24\" /> The CLRVs went into revenue service on route [[507 Long Branch]] on September 30, 1979. The vehicles were originally equipped with couplers, but these were removed between 1984 and 1988, and shields were placed over the empty coupler pockets to protect pedestrians.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nIn August 1982, the UTDC delivered an ALRV prototype, number 4900, which the TTC operated in revenue service for several months. Prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\" /> After sitting in storage at the St. Clair Carhouse since early 1983, prototype 4900 was returned to the UTDC's Kingston facility in 1987 where a year later it was damaged in a test track collision. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nALRV 4200, the first of the 52 production ALRVs (4200\u20134251, class L3), arrived in Toronto on June 11, 1987; ALRV 4204 began revenue service on route 507 Long Branch on January 19, 1988. Unlike the CLRVs, none of the production ALRVs was equipped with couplers, and shields covered their coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nIn 2006, CLRV 4041 was modified for air conditioning with a visibly distinctive air conditioning unit installed on its roof. It was a prototype for a proposed refurbishment project that was shelved.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe passage of ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]]'' in 2005 affected the high-floor CLRV/ALRV fleet because the act mandated all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025. In 2006, TTC staff explored ways to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing installing wheelchair lifts and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that these options were impractical, and recommended replacing the old fleet with new low-floor streetcars.<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2018-02-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" />\n\nAs the CLRV/ALRV fleet aged, its reliability declined. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" /> By 2014, the old fleet became vulnerable to extreme cold snaps resulting on January 3 in a breakdown of 50 out of the 195 streetcars required for rush hour service; water vapour had frozen in the pneumatic air lines preventing brakes and doors from functioning.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2014-01-03\" />\n\nDuring an extreme cold snap between January 20 and 21, 2019, the TTC withdrew all CLRV/ALRV streetcars from service due to the high risk of breakdowns in the cold weather.

In 2009, the TTC announced that it had chosen a customized version of the Bombardier [[Flexity Outlook]] as the model to replace the old fleet.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-04-24\" /> The TTC had required Bombardier to modify its Flexity Outlook design to handle the legacy system's trackwork, the standards for which mainly date back to the Peter Witt era of the 1920s. Specifically, Toronto's new streetcar had to navigate [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switches]], a minimum curve radius of {{convert|11|m|ft}}, and a maximum 8% grade. Light rail vehicles typically require double-point switches, a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} radius and a maximum 5% grade. The minimum radius requirement was the most challenging for Bombardier. The TTC estimated that it would have taken ten years to widen the curve radius throughout the system.<ref name=\"TTC-2008-08-27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2008/Aug_27_2008/Supplementary_Reports/LF_LRV_Procurement__.pdf |title=LF LRV Procurement Project - Cancellation of RFP & Way Forward |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2018-11-05 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the CLRV/ALRV, the new vehicles feature a low-floor design, a loading ramp for wheel-chair access, air-conditioning (only one CLRV had air-conditioning), a doubling of the passenger capacity, an interior bicycle area, a separated enclosed driver/operator cab walled off from the passenger area,<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-15\" /> on-board automatic fare vending machines, and electronic [[destination sign]]s at the front, side and rear of the vehicle (as opposed to roll signs). They were also the first streetcars which had two audible warning signals, featuring both an electronic gong and a horn, as opposed to the CLRVs and ALRVs, which were originally delivered with physical gongs only but had been retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s. The first two Flexity streetcars entered revenue service on August 31, 2014, on the [[510 Spadina]] route.\n\nEach Flexity streetcar is equipped with both a trolley pole and a pantograph for electrical pickup. (All older streetcars use a trolley pole.) Flexity streetcars operate with pantographs on routes where the electrical overhead has been converted for pantograph use. The introduction of Flexity streetcars is leading to the gradual phase-out of the trolley pole on the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-4506\" />\n\n{{further|Bombardier Transportation#Toronto Transit Commission}}\nDuring the manufacture of the Flexity streetcars, Bombardier experienced manufacturing and quality control problems mainly with welding at one of its plants. This resulted in major delivery delays, in that by the end of 2017, only 59 streetcars were delivered when about 150 were expected. In addition, in 2018, Bombardier requested the gradual recall of 67 vehicles to correct welding problems. With the delivery problems, and the retirement of many CLRV/ALRV streetcars too worn out to repair, a streetcar shortage occurred resulting in temporary bus replacements along some streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-07-03\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/07/03/most-new-ttc-streetcars-to-be-shipped-to-quebec-to-fix-welding-defect-bombardier-says.html |title=Most new TTC streetcars to be recalled to fix welding defect, Bombardier says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-07-03 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref> Bombardier expects to return all recalled Flexity streetcars by 2023<!--2019+4years-->. {{As of|2018|10}}, Bombardier is still expected to deliver the remainder of the 204 vehicle order by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-10-31\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/31/ttc-starts-shipping-new-streetcars-to-quebec-for-repairs.html |title=TTC starts shipping new streetcars to Quebec for repairs |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-10-31 |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the TTC took delivery of the last of 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars ordered from Bombardier.

The last such vehicles, rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31, were retired in 2002, their last assignment being in 1999.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" /> Except for rail grinders, all other types of work vehicles were retired before 1980.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\nWork cars had specialized duties. Besides rail grinding, there were work vehicles for snow clearing, construction (cranes, dump cars and flat cars) and deliveries for carhouses (e.g. sand cars, fare box cars). All these cars were self-propelled, taking power from the streetcar overhead wire. Some work cars\u2014such as dump cars, track plows and snow sweepers\u2014were purchased from outside rail equipment manufacturers. In some cases, the TTC inherited a car built in the shops of its predecessor, the Toronto Railway Company\u2014for example, crane C-1 and the fare box car (for hauling tickets and fare boxes between carhouses and head office). In many cases, cars such as rail grinders and snow scrapers were former passenger streetcars that the TTC converted to work cars. Old cars used for such conversions were usually inherited from the Toronto Railway Company and the Toronto Civic Railways.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} However, in one case, the TTC used a pair of PCCs to create rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" />\n\nRail-based, snow clearing cars were retired in the 1970s when City of Toronto Public Works department trucks took over that function. To clear light snow, the TTC purchased 12 snow sweepers in 1940 from the [[Third Avenue Railway System]] (TARS) and numbered them S-30 to S-41.

It inherited the infrastructure of two separate streetcar operators: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR). The TTC immediately embarked on a program to connect the TRC and TCR lines into one network. The TTC had to rebuild most of the track to provide a wider devilstrip so that the wider [[Peter Witt (Toronto streetcar)|Peter Witt streetcars]] it was ordering could pass without sideswiping.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=19}} Between 1938 and 1945, it placed five orders for air-electric PCC streetcars to replace the old, wooden streetcars of the TRC, and to address rising ridership. Between 1947 and 1951, the TTC placed 3 orders for all-electric PCC cars, with one order equipped with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1950 and 1957, the TTC purchased PCCs from four American cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Birmingham and Kansas City). By 1957, the TTC (later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] in 1954) had more PCCs than any other city in North America. After the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966, the TTC considered terminating all streetcar service in Toronto. However, in 1972, a citizens group called Streetcars for Toronto persuaded the City to retain streetcar operation.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-02\" /> This led to the development of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) and its longer, articulated cousin, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), to replace the aging PCC fleet. The ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005]]'' (AODA) mandated that the next generation of streetcars be wheelchair-accessible. Thus, to replace the CLRVs and ALRVs, Bombardier adapted its low-floor [[Flexity Outlook]] model [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|for the TTC]] to navigate the Toronto streetcar system's tight curves and single-point switches, characteristics set in the 1920s to accommodate Peter Witt streetcars.\n\n== Inherited streetcars ==\nWhen the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created in 1921, it inherited the facilities of its two predecessor companies: the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) and the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] (TCR).\n\n===Ex-TRC streetcars===\n[[File:TTC (ex-TRC) streetcar -1934 at College & Spadina.jpg|thumb|Class BB ex-TRC streetcar at College & Spadina in December 1925]]\nThe Toronto Transportation Commission inherited 830 streetcars from the Toronto Railway Company. However, the TTC found that only 351 of them were worth retaining; thus, the TTC disposed of the remaining 479 by 1924. (Two of the disposed cars were relics \u2013 [[horsecar]] 64, built in 1879, and streetcar 306, built in 1892 \u2013 both ultimately sent to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]] in Ottawa.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe 351 streetcars the TTC chose to retain were single-ended streetcars built between 1906 and 1917 in the TRC's own shops. They were all even-numbered and retained their original TRC car numbers. The TTC modified these streetcars and reclassified them into four classes by sets of features.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe A- and A1-class cars were operated from the mid-1920s as six-motor trains with an A1-class (4-motor) car leading a coupled A-class (2-motor) car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=28}} These trains required a crew of three, two for the lead car and another for the trailing car.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}} Six-motor trains lasted until 1933 when the A-class cars were retired due to a decline of ridership during the [[Great Depression]]. After the retirement of the A-class cars, the A1-class cars would pull a Class N or Q trailer until 1934.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=53}}\n\nThe Class C cars had a Tomlinson coupler to pull a Class N or Q trailer, which in later years would be semi-permanently attached. The Class C cars were retired in 1949. The trailers were then reassigned.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=77}} Class C-1 was a variation of Class C omitting the coupler. These cars required a 2-man crew.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nThe Class BB class was the largest group of ex-TRC cars. Twenty BB-class cars were transferred to other cities during World War II: 5 to Fort William, 10 to Ottawa and 5 to Quebec City.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=65}} The Class BB cars were the last of the ex-TRC cars to be retired, the last forty being retired in 1951. Class BB car 1326 is preserved at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] museum.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=79}} These cars required a crew of one.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\nBetween 1923 and 1933, the TTC modified all of its ex-TRC cars, at least once, often twice and in one case (1328) three times, each time converting the car from one class to another. A common second conversion was from C or C1 (2-man operation) to BB class (1-man operation). All C1 cars and many C-class cars were converted to BB-class by 1933. The following tables reflect the classes of retained ex-TRC streetcars after the final modification. The table is in TRC class and year built sequence, and roughly in car number sequence.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=157}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! TTC<br />Class\n! Class characteristics\n!

All were scrapped in 1936, with the exception of car 2120, which the TTC converted into a snow scraper and used on the [[North Yonge Railways]] until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=28}}\n\nThe TTC used the double-truck Class H cars (TCR 100\u2013119, TTC 2128\u20132144 & 2148\u20132166) mainly on the [[Toronto Suburban Railway#Weston|Weston]] route and also on [[Spadina streetcar line (1923\u201348)|Spadina]] route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=30}} TCR car 109 (TTC 2146) was destroyed by fire in 1921.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=158}}\n\nThe Class J (TCR 200\u2013212, TTC 2168\u20132192) double-truck streetcars, ran mainly on the Spadina route and also on the Weston route until 1948.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=31}}\n\nThe TTC used the Class F, single-truck streetcars (TCR 50\u201357, TTC 2200\u20132214) for rush-hour service until 1926 after which they were converted into snow scrapers. The only three survivors of the entire TCR fleet are from this class, and all three are preserved at the Halton County Radial Railway museum in [[Milton, Ontario]].{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=34}} Preserved TCR car 55 (TTC 2210) was restored to its original TCR condition. The TTC had converted the other two surviving Class F cars into [[rail grinder]]s and both are preserved as such at the museum. TCR 52 (TTC 2204) became subway rail grinder RT-7, and TCR 57 (TTC 2214) became streetcar system rail grinder W-28.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=79}}\n\nClass G (TCR: 60\u201384, TTC 2216\u20132264) consisted of single-truck, [[Birney (Toronto streetcar)|Birney cars]] which were used on various TTC routes, such as [[Toronto Suburban Railway#Davenport|Davenport]] and Coxwell, until 1940. The cars were sold in 1927, 1940 and 1941 to run in Cornwall and Halifax until 1949, after which they were scrapped.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=34\u201336}}\n\nIn May 1923, the TTC renumbered all the TCR streetcars with even numbers only.

The new cars were wider than the older TRC cars, and the [[devilstrip]] between parallel tracks was too narrow at {{convert|3|ft|10|in}}. The TTC had to relay track throughout the system to widen the devil strip to {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=17}}\n\nThe Peter Witt streetcars, the first all-steel streetcars in Toronto, came in two versions: Large and small. The large Witts were {{convert|51|ft|10|in}} long and had 60 seats; the small Witts, {{convert|47|ft|m}} long and 55 seats. The large Witts had a slow speed but the strength to pull a trailer. The small Witts were faster in operation, could move along better in traffic but could not pull a trailer. Trailer-trains were used on heavily traveled routes such as [[Yonge streetcar line|Yonge]], [[Bloor streetcar line|Bloor]], College and Dundas.{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=43}}\n\nA streetcar gets a \"Peter Witt\" designation if it was built using the Peter Witt fare payment design. With Peter Witt streetcars, passengers enter by the front doors and pay their fare as they walk past the conductor seated just before centre doors. Passengers must pay their fare when they pass the conductor either to exit the car by the centre doors or to access the rear of the car. This scheme was dubbed \"pay-as-you-pass\". Passengers could ride in the unpaid front portion of the car or in the paid rear portion.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=12}} During the Great Depression, many Witt cars were converted to one-man operation eliminating the conductor's position and relocating the fare box at the car's entrance.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=17}}\n\nThe \"Peter Witt\" trailers were not of the Peter Witt design because of their door arrangement. The Class N trailers had two narrow centre doors flanking the conductor's position, and were slow to load and unload. Thus, the three-door Class Q trailers (also known as Harvey trailers) were introduced with a double door on one side of the conductor's position and a single, narrow door on the other side. One of the doors had a gate so that it could be used as either an entry or exit.{{sfn|Partridge|1982|p=39\u201342}}\n\nOriginally, all but the class P small Witts had a fully enclosed operator cab. (This feature that would not be repeated in Toronto until the introduction of the [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] in 2014.) Around 1940, the cab walls were removed.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=56}}\n\nThe first major retirement came in 1938 with the introduction of PCC streetcars. All 60 class N trailers and 30 of the class Q trailers were withdrawn with PCCs replacing Peter Witt trailer-trains on the Bloor and Dundas streetcar routes. These were the first of the new cars purchased by the TTC to be scrapped after only 15\u201317 years of service.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=59}} The next major retirement came in 1954 with the opening of the Yonge subway (today a part of [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]]). All the remaining trailers and all of the large Peter Witt cars were retired. The subway replaced the Yonge streetcar line, which heavily used Peter Witt trailer-trains.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=88,159}} The final major retirement, this time of the remaining small Peter Witt cars, came in 1965 following the opening of the University subway (also a part of Line 1 Yonge\u2013University).{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=97,159}}\n\nMotor cars are even-numbered; trailers are odd-numbered:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=159}}{{sfn|Partridge|1983|p=46}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The TTC bought these cars to replace the [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] cars and older vehicles inherited from the Toronto Railway Company. The TTC's first purchase was in 1938, and by the end of the 1950s, they operated a larger fleet of PCCs than any other agency in the world with 744 cars in service.\n\nThe TTC purchased 745 PCC streetcars in all, 317 air-electric (with air-compressor) and 428 all-electric (no air-compressor), 540 new and 205 used (from [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|several U.S. operators abandoning streetcar service]]). 175 PCCs had couplers for multiple-unit operation, and the TTC used them to assemble two-car PCC trains. (The TTC had only a maximum of 744 PCCs in service because PCC 4063 was scrapped after it derailed and crashed into a carhouse wall in 1947.){{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=71}}\n\nIn 1963, with the opening of the University subway (part of today's Line 1 Yonge\u2013University) and the closure of the Dupont streetcar route, the last of the Peter Witt streetcars were retired resulting in a 100% PCC streetcar fleet.\n\nThe first major retirement of PCCs occurred with the opening of the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway (today [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]]) in 1966. The heavily used Bloor streetcar line (where two-car PCC trains ran) plus four intersecting streetcar routes (Coxwell, [[Harbord streetcar line|Harbord]], Parliament, [[511 Bathurst#History|Fort]]) were abandoned. The all-electric PCCs from the Bloor route were moved elsewhere displacing the older air-electric cars, many of which were sold to [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=117,114}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, as CLRVs were replacing the ageing PCC fleet, the TTC started to create a new class of PCC cars (class A15) by rebuilding A8-class cars. By 1992, it had rebuilt 19 PCCs for use on the new Harbourfront streetcar line (part of today's [[509 Harbourfront]] service). However, in 1995, the A15 class PCCs were retired because the CLRV fleet could handle the ridership, which had declined by that time. The TTC retained A15-class PCCs 4500 and 4549 for excursions and special events.<ref name=\"TT-4509\" />\n\nThe following PCC streetcars made up the TTC fleet:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|p=161}}<ref name=\"TT-4507\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The UTDC hoped to sell CLRVs, or variations of it, to other streetcar and light rail systems in North America. Subsequently, in the 1980s, the UTDC developed the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV), the longer, articulated version of the CLRV.\n\nThe first six CLRVs (4000\u20134005, class L1) were built by [[Sig Holding AG|Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (Swiss Industrial Company, SIG), and were tested in Switzerland serving as prototypes. The remaining 190 CLRVs (4010\u20134199, class L2) were built by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] Limited in [[Thunder Bay]].<ref name=\"BlogTO2014-02-24\" /> The CLRVs went into revenue service on route [[507 Long Branch]] on September 30, 1979. The vehicles were originally equipped with couplers, but these were removed between 1984 and 1988, and shields were placed over the empty coupler pockets to protect pedestrians.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nIn August 1982, the UTDC delivered an ALRV prototype, number 4900, which the TTC operated in revenue service for several months. Prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\" /> After sitting in storage at the St. Clair Carhouse since early 1983, prototype 4900 was returned to the UTDC's Kingston facility in 1987 where a year later it was damaged in a test track collision. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nALRV 4200, the first of the 52 production ALRVs (4200\u20134251, class L3), arrived in Toronto on June 11, 1987; ALRV 4204 began revenue service on route 507 Long Branch on January 19, 1988. Unlike the CLRVs, none of the production ALRVs was equipped with couplers, and shields covered their coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nIn 2006, CLRV 4041 was modified for air conditioning with a visibly distinctive air conditioning unit installed on its roof. It was a prototype for a proposed refurbishment project that was shelved.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe passage of ''[[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]]'' in 2005 affected the high-floor CLRV/ALRV fleet because the act mandated all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025. In 2006, TTC staff explored ways to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing installing wheelchair lifts and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that these options were impractical, and recommended replacing the old fleet with new low-floor streetcars.<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2018-02-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" />\n\nAs the CLRV/ALRV fleet aged, its reliability declined. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" /> By 2014, the old fleet became vulnerable to extreme cold snaps resulting on January 3 in a breakdown of 50 out of the 195 streetcars required for rush hour service; water vapour had frozen in the pneumatic air lines preventing brakes and doors from functioning.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2014-01-03\" />\n\nDuring an extreme cold snap between January 20 and 21, 2019, the TTC withdrew all CLRV/ALRV streetcars from service due to the high risk of breakdowns in the cold weather.

In 2009, the TTC announced that it had chosen a customized version of the Bombardier [[Flexity Outlook]] as the model to replace the old fleet.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-04-24\" /> The TTC had required Bombardier to modify its Flexity Outlook design to handle the legacy system's trackwork, the standards for which mainly date back to the Peter Witt era of the 1920s. Specifically, Toronto's new streetcar had to navigate [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switches]], a minimum curve radius of {{convert|11|m|ft}}, and a maximum 8% grade. Light rail vehicles typically require double-point switches, a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} radius and a maximum 5% grade. The minimum radius requirement was the most challenging for Bombardier. The TTC estimated that it would have taken ten years to widen the curve radius throughout the system.<ref name=\"TTC-2008-08-27\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2008/Aug_27_2008/Supplementary_Reports/LF_LRV_Procurement__.pdf |title=LF LRV Procurement Project - Cancellation of RFP & Way Forward |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2018-11-05 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the CLRV/ALRV, the new vehicles feature a low-floor design, a loading ramp for wheel-chair access, air-conditioning (only one CLRV had air-conditioning), a doubling of the passenger capacity, an interior bicycle area, a separated enclosed driver/operator cab walled off from the passenger area,<ref name=\"Torontoist-2012-11-15\" /> on-board automatic fare vending machines, and electronic [[destination sign]]s at the front, side and rear of the vehicle (as opposed to roll signs). They were also the first streetcars which had two audible warning signals, featuring both an electronic gong and a horn, as opposed to the CLRVs and ALRVs, which were originally delivered with physical gongs only but had been retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s. The first two Flexity streetcars entered revenue service on August 31, 2014, on the [[510 Spadina]] route.\n\nEach Flexity streetcar is equipped with both a trolley pole and a pantograph for electrical pickup. (All older streetcars use a trolley pole.) Flexity streetcars operate with pantographs on routes where the electrical overhead has been converted for pantograph use. The introduction of Flexity streetcars is leading to the gradual phase-out of the trolley pole on the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-4506\" />\n\n{{further|Bombardier Transportation#Toronto Transit Commission}}\nDuring the manufacture of the Flexity streetcars, Bombardier experienced manufacturing and quality control problems mainly with welding at one of its plants. This resulted in major delivery delays, in that by the end of 2017, only 59 streetcars were delivered when about 150 were expected. In addition, in 2018, Bombardier requested the gradual recall of 67 vehicles to correct welding problems. With the delivery problems, and the retirement of many CLRV/ALRV streetcars too worn out to repair, a streetcar shortage occurred resulting in temporary bus replacements along some streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-07-03\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/07/03/most-new-ttc-streetcars-to-be-shipped-to-quebec-to-fix-welding-defect-bombardier-says.html |title=Most new TTC streetcars to be recalled to fix welding defect, Bombardier says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-07-03 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref> Bombardier expects to return all recalled Flexity streetcars by 2023<!--2019+4years-->. {{As of|2018|10}}, Bombardier is still expected to deliver the remainder of the 204 vehicle order by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-10-31\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/10/31/ttc-starts-shipping-new-streetcars-to-quebec-for-repairs.html |title=TTC starts shipping new streetcars to Quebec for repairs |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=2018-10-31 |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the TTC took delivery of the last of 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars ordered from Bombardier. Streetcar 4603 was delivered by rail to the [[Hillcrest Complex]] from Bombardier's Thunder Bay plant. The last streetcar was a little over three weeks late, as Bombardier had promised to deliver the last car by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TheStar-2020-01-25\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Builder\n!

The last such vehicles, rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31, were retired in 2002, their last assignment being in 1999.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" /> Except for rail grinders, all other types of work vehicles were retired before 1980.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\nWork cars had specialized duties. Besides rail grinding, there were work vehicles for snow clearing, construction (cranes, dump cars and flat cars) and deliveries for carhouses (e.g. sand cars, fare box cars). All these cars were self-propelled, taking power from the streetcar overhead wire. Some work cars\u2014such as dump cars, track plows and snow sweepers\u2014were purchased from outside rail equipment manufacturers. In some cases, the TTC inherited a car built in the shops of its predecessor, the Toronto Railway Company\u2014for example, crane C-1 and the fare box car (for hauling tickets and fare boxes between carhouses and head office). In many cases, cars such as rail grinders and snow scrapers were former passenger streetcars that the TTC converted to work cars. Old cars used for such conversions were usually inherited from the Toronto Railway Company and the Toronto Civic Railways.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} However, in one case, the TTC used a pair of PCCs to create rail grinding cars W-30 and W-31.<ref name=\"TT-4508\" />\n\nRail-based, snow clearing cars were retired in the 1970s when City of Toronto Public Works department trucks took over that function. To clear light snow, the TTC purchased 12 snow sweepers in 1940 from the [[Third Avenue Railway System]] (TARS) and numbered them S-30 to S-41. These cars were built by Russell Car Company in 1920\u20131921 and were double-truck, double-end vehicles. The TTC scrapped two of the sweepers in 1966; the remainder remained active until 1971 and were retired in 1972.{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}} After retirement, one sweeper was sold to a transit operator in New Jersey<!--to become car #5246 in Trenton? Newark?-->.<ref name=\"BSM\" /> For heavier snow, the TTC acquired two snow plows, TP-10 and TP-11, from [[National Steel Car]]. Both cars are preserved at museums.<ref name=\"TT-4510\" />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:TTC W-27 Rail Grinding Car outside Bathurst Shops in Toronto, ONT on September 8, 1965 (22631910121).jpg|W-27 rail grinding car at [[Hillcrest Complex]], 1965\nFile:TTC W-8 and W-4 street strip painting cars at Bathurst Shops, Toronto, ONT on September 8, 1965 (22568207152).jpg|W-8 & W-4 <!-- as per Bromley & May: -->construction cars at Hillcrest Complex, 1965\nFile:TTC TP-10 track plow and S-34 snow sweeper at Roncesvalles Div. yards, Toronto, ONT on July 2, 1966 (22631910911).jpg|TP-10 track plow (left) & S-34 Russell snow sweeper at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], 1966\nFile:19950529 13 TTC Hillcrest Shop (5344370365).jpg|W-30 & W-31 rail grinding cars at Hillcrest Complex, 1995\n</gallery>\n\nThe following table lists work cars preserved at museums, a few of which are pictured above:{{sfn|Bromley|May|1978|pp=163\u2013166}}<!--The table should include only those cars preserved as work cars in TTC or TRC colours.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The film was directed by [[Tony Randel]], who also co-wrote the script with Peter Atkins, and stars [[Gary Daniels]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Isako Washio]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. A [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the film was produced by [[Toei Video]] which featured the cast of the 1980s anime television series reprising their roles.\n\nThe film, which loosely adapts the first story arc of the original manga, centers on [[Kenshiro|Ken]] (Daniels), the lone master of the \"[[Hokuto Shinken|North Star]]\" martial art school, who wanders the post-apocalyptic Earth in search of his nemesis Lord Shin, the man who killed his master and kidnapped his fiancee. Meanwhile, Shin rules as dictator of the city of Southern Cross with his personal army known as the Crossmen, who are given orders to hunt down Kenshiro.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the aftermath of [[World War III]], the world has plunged into anarchy and chaos. Water is scarce and what is left of the human race scrounges for survival. Two opposing martial arts schools, North Star and Southern Cross, both devoted to bringing order to the world, were previously thrown into disarray after Southern Cross adept Shin turned against his masters and summarily executed North Star master Ryuken, leaving his son Kenshiro as the sole heir to the North Star. Shin then sought Kenshiro himself, defeated him and left him for dead after carving his chest with seven scars in the shape of the [[Big Dipper]]. Shin also abducted Kenshiro's fiancee and their shared love interest Julia, segregating her in his tower. Since then, Shin rules the land with an iron fist through a militia called the Crossmen, led by Jackal, a ruthless henchman whose bulging head is held in leather bandages after Kenshiro disfgured him in an earlier fight.\n\nBack in the current time, Kenshiro, who survived Shin's aggression, wanders the wasteland aimlessly. After killing a gang led by bandit Zeed, who attacked the homestead that had given him shelter for the night, Kenshiro continues on towards the town of Paradise Valley, home to one of the few remaining sources of pure water. There, he meets orphan siblings Bat and Lynn. After using a pressure point technique to restore Lynn's sight, which she lost after watching her parents murdered by Crossmen, Kenshiro departs, ignoring Lynn's plea to remain and protect them. Bat follows Kenshiro to talk him into joining the organized resistance against the Crossmen's incursions, to no avail.\n\nThe Crossmen raid Paradise Valley and occupy it, commandeering the well. Jackal orders Lynn's execution for sedition, but halts it after she threateningly mentions Kenshiro, taking her prisoner instead to extort Kenshiro's whereabouts. As Lynn's screams from afar ring inside Kenshiro's head, Kenshiro turns back: he and Bat infiltrate the occupied town and free Lynn, but Bat is mortally wounded in a fight against Jackal. Kenshiro spares Jackal and sends him back to Shin to announce his arrival.\n\nBy Shin's order, Jackal takes Julia to the tower's basement to hide her from Kenshiro. There, he engages in a [[cat-and-mouse game]] in an attempt to rape and kill Julia. Kenshiro breaks into Shin's tower and confronts him in the throne room. As Kenshiro gains the upper hand in the ensuing showdown, Shin lies about Julia's fate and takes advantage of Kenshiro's shock to overpower him. However, after noticing a bud that has sprouted from a seed he had given Julia long before, Kenshiro regains hope and defeats Shin, killing him. After freeing herself from Jackal by removing his bandages and causing his head to swell and explode, Julia rejoins Kenshiro. The surviving Crossmen bow to Kenshiro and Julia in deference.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Daniels]] as [[Kenshiro]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Lord Shin\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Jackal\n* [[Isako Washio]] as Julia\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Asher\n* [[Downtown Julie Brown]] as Charlie\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Bat\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Paul McCarthy\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Stalin\n* [[Big Van Vader]] as Goliath\n* Paulo Tocha as Stone\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Ryuken\n* Nalona Herron as Lynn\n* Bill Nagel as Miner\n* Andre Rosey Brown as Sandman\n* Rowena Guinness as Jill McCarthy\n* Michael Charles Friedman as Neuter\n* Nils Allen Stewart as Zeed\n* [[Tony Halme]] as Kemp\n* [[David \"Shark\" Fralick]] as Man at Palace\n* [[George Kee Cheung]] as Neville\n* [[Michael Franco]] as AWOL Crossman A\n* David Loo as AWOL Crossman B\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Woman\n* [[Chris DeRose]] as Oswald\n* [[Darryl Chan]] as Novack\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Jenny\n* Kate Geer as Mother\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was not reviewed by many mainstream critics, and it got mixed reviews from fans and online critics.
