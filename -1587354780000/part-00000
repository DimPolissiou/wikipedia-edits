The enlistment draft is held in early-April annually. On the draftee selection day, those who are called up for the draft report to their selection center at 07:00. During roll call, eligible draftees can request to volunteer to serve, or they may choose to stay for the lottery. Those who volunteer then undergo physical and mental health examinations including a urine test for drugs.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\">{{cite news|last1=Laohong|first1=King-Oua|title=12,000 draftees 'on drugs'|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1448931/12-000-draftees-on-drugs|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=20 April 2018}}</ref> The results of the urine test for drugs are entered into a Narcotics Control Board database.

Over 3,000 of those who tested positive will serve in the military where they will receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Those who tested positive, but who were not drafted, will undergo a 13-day rehabilitation regimen in their home provinces.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\" />  Those who do not pass the physical and mental health examinations are promptly discharged. The enlisting volunteers then choose the service branch (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, or Royal Thai Air Force) and the reporting date of their choice, and receive documentation of the year's draft selection, and an enlistment order to report for basic training with notification details of the reporting time and location. The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition.

Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.\n\n===Officer and enlisted rank insignia===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Thailand}}\n|}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Thailand}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Thai soldiers and Type 85 APCs during 2010 Thai political protests.jpg|RTA troops take cover next to a [[Type 85 AFV]] near the Red Shirt barricade at [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]]\nFile:2010 0513 silom 11.JPG|Soldiers with riot shields at a barricade on [[Silom Road]] and Soi Convent\nFile:2010 0513 saladaeng station 02.JPG|Soldiers beneath Saladaeng BTS station, Silom Road\nFile:2010 0513 silom 07.JPG|Soldiers and a helmeted journalist buy water and food, Silom Road\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 02.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, [[Chiang Mai]], days after the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 01.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 110211-M-VX252-046 - Royal Thai and U.S. Marines discuss how to eliminate hostile forces firing on them from a building during a mock mechanized raid on Feb. 11 2011.jpg|[[Royal Thai Marine Corps|Royal Thai]] and [[US Marines]] eliminating hostile forces during a mock raid, 11 February 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-027.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces service member clears a building during a mock raid, [[Cobra Gold]], 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-017.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces clear a building during a mock raid, Cobra Gold, 2011\nFile:Thai service members participate in a rivierine subject matter expert exchange with U.S. Sailors in the Nakhon Nayok River as part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2013 in Thailand June 8 130608-N-RG360-224.jpg|Thai troops in a riverine exercise with US sailors on the Nakhon Nayok River, [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT), 8 June 2013\nFile:Rtaf All FlighterJet.jpg|RTAF fighters: [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16|F-16 ADF]], [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Alpha jet]], [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] and [[SAAB-340]]\nFile:HTMS Naresuan in Hong Kong.JPG|RTN frigate [[HTMS Naresuan]] FFG-421 moored in [[Victoria Harbour]], Hong Kong\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Border Patrol Police]]\n* [[King's Guard (Thailand)]]\n* [[List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]]\n* [[Military ranks of the Thai armed forces]]\n* [[Royal Thai Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Thai Police]]\n* [[Territorial Defence Student]]\n* [[Thahan Phran]]\n* [[Underwater Demolition Assault Unit]]\n* [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{loc}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Osornprasop, Sutayut. \"Thailand and the Secret War in Laos\", 1960\u20131974 (in) Albert Lau (ed.), ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War''.

{"title_page": "Otulu, Oru West", "text_new": "<ref>https://www.citypopulation.de/php/nigeria-admin.php?adm1id=NGA017</ref>{{for|the community in Ahiara|Otulu, Ahiara}}\n{{Unsourced|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Otulu''' is a town in Oru West local government area of [[Imo State]], [[Nigeria]]. It is located along the Owerri-Onitsha Federal Highway (which is identified as Highway A6 by Google map) in Imo State. Approaching from Owerri to Onitsha you will get to Awo-Omanma, Amiri and then Otulu after which you have Mgbidi; while from Onitsha to Owerri you have Otulu after Mgbidi. \n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\n{{Coord missing|Nigeria}}The name Otulu is derived from two Igbo words 'Otu' which means 'One' and 'Olu' which means 'voice' which when put together means 'One Voice'. The father of Otulu is Igbo n'abunkwu. He Originated from Nri in Anambra State. This is the reason why the community is known as Otulu Igbo n'abunkwu. When Igbo n'abunkwu started expanding, he and some other immigrants of his community chose the name Otulu \"One Voice\" which signifies Unity that is 'let us be united'.\n\nAccording to Chief E. Ndubuisi (personal communication, July 29, 2014), Otulu married two wives, the first wife was Lolo Ogueri Ukwu and the second wife was Lolo Oji. The first wife had two children namely Umuhu and Umuezem. The second wife had three children namely Ubahawa, Okponsu and Umuojienwe. Umuhu is the first son of Otulu, Umuezem is the second son, Ubahawa is the third son, Okponsu is the forth son and Umuojienwe is the last son. Umuhu had three children they are Umunkwa, Umudurukwu and Umuofia. Umuhu made the first community, Umuezem also made his own community with his five sons namely Umuochihe, Umuelile, Umunka, Umuaro and Umuaso. Ubahawa made his own community with his six sons they are Umuokwa, Umunabia,Umudikwa, Ubahawa Oji, Umuabuba, Umuosunkita including his two brothers Okponsu and Umuojienwe. These made up the sixteen (16) villages in Otulu. Otulu had initially one autonomous community with the sixteen villages but the recent creation of autonomous community in Imo State in the year 2003 brought about the division of the town Otulu into two different autonomous communities such that each autonomous community is headed by a traditional ruler. This is to say that Umuhu and Umuezem autonomous communities were created from the then Otulu autonomous community with the Imo State of Nigeria official gazette No.4 \u00a0Vol 28 \u00a0of 29th October 2003. The Umuhu and Umuezem autonomous communities are made up of eight (8) villages namely Umuofia, Umunka, Umuelile, Umudurukwu, Umuaro, Umuochihe, and Umuaso. While Otulu autonomous community is left with the remaining (8) villages namely Umuokwa, Ubahawa Oji, Umudikwa, Umuabuba, Umunabia, Umuosonkita, Okposu and Umuojienwe.\n\nOtulu has two Traditional Rulers namely Obi of Otulu in the person of HRH Eze Festus I. Orji and Igwe of Otulu in the person of HRH Eze Sunday B. Nnabue; ruling Otulu autonomous community and Umuhu/Umuezem autonomous communities respectively.\n\n== Demographics ==\n<nowiki>Otulu has a population of about 20,028 people living in it.{{</nowiki><ref>http://population.city/nigeria/adm/imo/</ref><nowiki>date=July 2019}}. It has two autonomous communities: Ubahawa and Umuhu/Umuezem.</nowiki>\n\nUbahawa has the following villages:\n\n# Umundikwa\n# Umunnabe\n# Ubahawa-ocha\n# Ubahawa-oji\n# Nkponsu\n# Umuabuba\n# Umuosonkita\n# Umuojienwe\n\nWhile Umuhu/Umuezem has: \n\n# Umunkwa \n# Umudurukwu\n# Umuofia\n# Umuochoihe\n# Umunka\n# Umuelile\n# Umuaro\n# Umuaso\n\nMost people in the town are typically Christians roughly split between the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church. There is a huge following of Anglicanism amongst the natives of Ubahawa with the St. Stephen's Anglican Church serving as a local church as well as an archdeaconry. The Anglican church also has some few worshipers from Umuhu and Umuezem, as well as from the non-indigenes. The St. Stephen's Anglican Church, Otulu was originally established in 1914 by the Christian Missionary Society (CMS).\n\nThe Roman Catholic historically has being dominant in Umuhu and Umuezem, although it also has a sizeable following in Ubahawa. St. Christopher's Catholic Church was established in Ubahawa in the 1990s.\n\nBefore the advent of Christianity, Otulu people like many other African communities are deeply involved in their native beliefs and village deities such as Ogwugwu, Obana and Ala Umuhu. Back then, every family compound has a corner set apart for their family deity, and the head (father) of the family would offers sacrifice regularly on behalf of his family and for other needs. The chief priest does the same for the whole community. But with the advent of Christianity, Otulu now have just very few or no families who still retain this practice.\n\n== Education ==\nThere is one Secondary school in Otulu, which is called Otulu Secondary Commercial School. It was built by the people in the early 1980s. There are two government-owned primary schools namely Community Primary School Otulu and Progressive Central School Otulu. \n\n== Economy ==\nOtulu have two market squares called Afor Otulu and Orie Otulu situated at Ubahawa and Umuhu/Umuezem respectively.\n\nThe town benefits hugely from being on the Onitsha-Owerri highway, as such a lot of shops and businesses typically tend to be sited along this highway. There used to be a few manufacturing facilities located in the town in the 1990s and early 2000s, but not any more.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are various cultural festivals which the Otulu people are known for, such festivals includes Owu festival, Ogugu festival, which between June and July of every year, Iri-ji ( New yam festival) which is conducted mainly by the Traditional Rulers.\n\nAugust Meeting is a yearly event held by Otulu women in the month of August.\n\nThe Obana (masquerade) festival takes place in October and November every year. \n\nThe Christmas and New Year holidays are big events in Otulu. Indigenous Otuluers, resident in other parts of the world, typically travel back home (i.e. Otulu) with their family to spend time with their other relatives and friends. There are football tournaments and several outdoor parties such as wedding ceremonies and age-grade activities during this festive season.\n\n<br />{{Populated places of Imo State}}\n\n[[Category: Populated places in Imo State]]\n\n\n{{Imo-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "<ref>https://www.citypopulation.de/php/nigeria-admin.php?adm1id=NGA017</ref>{{for|the community in Ahiara|Otulu, Ahiara}}\n{{Unsourced|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Otulu''' is a community in Oru West local government area of [[Imo State]], [[Nigeria]].

Drawn to dance, but unable to find a choreographer whose work fulfilled him, Ailey started gathering dancers to perform his own unique vision of dance.\n\n==Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater==\nIn 1958 Ailey founded the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] to present his vision of honoring Black culture through dance. The company had its debut at the [[92nd Street Y]]. The performance included Ailey's first masterpiece, ''Blues Suite'', which followed men and women as they caroused and cavorted over the course of an evening while blues music played in the background until church bells began to ring, signalling a return to mundane life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/arts/review-dance-three-suites-and-a-solo-in-the-ailey-tradition.html|title=Review/Dance; Three Suites and a Solo In the Ailey Tradition|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=1989-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1912037|title=Alvin Ailey's Dance Troupe at 45|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> Two years later he premiered his most popular and critically acclaimed work, ''[[Revelations (Alvin Ailey)|Revelations]]'', again at the 92nd Street Y. In creating ''Revelations'' Ailey drew upon his \"blood memories\" of growing up in Texas surrounded by Black people, the church, spirituals, and the blues.

Though the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] sponsored AAADT's first international tour in 1962, which traveled across Asia\u2014with followups to Senegal in 1966 and East & West Africa in 1967\u2014the company was able to book only a few performances per season in America. After a successful week-long engagement at the Billy Rose Theatre, the company was invited to become the resident company at Brooklyn Academy of Music. The relationship did not go well and ended a few years later.\n\nIn 1970, with few bookings on the radar\u2014and on the eve of a tour to Russia as part of a cultural exchange agreement\u2014Ailey announced at a press conference that he was closing the company. In response, the State Department sponsored an Ailey tour of North Africa to tide things over. That August, the company toured to Russia where it was ecstatically received. Their performances were broadcast on Moscow television and seen by over 22 million viewers. On closing night, because the Russian audiences would not stop applauding, the company gave over 30 curtain calls. Returning home with news of this triumph, the company performed a two-week engagement at the [[ANTA Theatre|ANTA Theater]]. By the end of January 1971 performance, the entire run was sold out. After 13 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre was a monumental success. In August 1972 the company was briefly renamed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater and became a resident company of [[New York City Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/alvin-ailey-arsonist-modern-dance-is-getting-hot-then-in-april-of.html|title=Modern dance is getting hot|last=Cohn|first=Ellen|date=1973-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThough Ailey's work has been met with popular and critical acclaim, there have been detractors of his theatrical style.

They are as honest and truthful as we can make them. I'm interested in putting something on stage that will have a very wide appeal without being condescending; that will reach an audience and make it part of the dance; that will get everybody into the theater. If it's art and entertainment\u2014thank God, that's what I want to be.\"\n\nWhile Ailey choreographed more than 70 ballets for his dancers, he insisted that the company perform pieces by other choreographers rather than stand as a singular vehicle for his voice. In present-day the company continues this ethos by presenting major revivals and commissioning pieces from a wide range of choreographers. The company's repertoire contains over 200 ballets.\n\nThough AAADT was formed to celebrate African American culture and to provide performances for black dancers, who were frequently denied opportunities due to racist mores of the time, Ailey proudly employed artists based solely on artistic talent and integrity, regardless of their background.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newnownext.com/lgbt-black-history-month/01/2016/|title=9 LGBT People Of Color Who Changed History|work=LOGO News|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> In addition to his work as artistic director and choreographer with AADT, Ailey also choreographed ballets for other companies including American Ballet Theatre,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/arts/dance/29wilson.html|title=Sallie Wilson, 76, Dramatic Ballerina Famed for Antony Tudor Roles|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=2008-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Joffrey Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/arts/the-dance-3-works-by-ailey.html|title=The Dance: 3 Works by Ailey|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=1986-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and The Metropolitan Opera.

Their aim was to provide access to arts and dance to under-resourced communities. They started off in Brooklyn with 125 students. A year later the school relocated to Manhattan behind the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s complex. In 1984, [[Denise Jefferson]] assumed directorship. Under her leadership, the school developed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in partnership with Fordham University in 1998. The school was renamed The Ailey School in 1999. Several years later, the school moved into The Joan Weill Center for Dance. Following Jefferson's death in 2010, [[Tracy Inman]] and [[Melanie Person]] assumed stewardship of the school as co-directors of the school. In 2012, after leading Ailey 2 for 38 years, [[Sylvia Waters]] retired. The second company's resident choreographer and associate director [[Troy Powell]] took over her role as artistic director. With the addition of the Elaine Wynn and Family Education Wing, the Ailey school is still growing and is now the largest place in New York City committed to training dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaileyschool.edu/history-philosophy|title=History & Philosophy|date=2016-03-02|work=The Ailey School|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAiley loathed the label \"black choreographer\" and preferred being known simply as a choreographer.

Alvin Ailey Jr., was an African-American dancer, director, [[choreographer]], and [[activist]] who founded the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] (AAADT), one of the most successful dance companies in the world. He created AAADT and its affiliated Ailey School as havens for nurturing black artists and expressing the universality of the African-American experience through dance. His work fused theatre, modern dance, ballet, and jazz with black vernacular, creating hope-fueled choreography that continues to spread global awareness of black life in America.

The company had its debut at the [[92nd Street Y]].

Though the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] sponsored AAADT's first international tour in 1962, which traveled across Asia\u2014with followups to Senegal in 1966 and East & West Africa in 1967\u2014the company was able to book only a few performances per season in America. After a successful week-long engagement at the Billy Rose Theatre, the company was invited to become the resident company at Brooklyn Academy of Music. The relationship did not go well and ended a few years later.\n\nIn 1970, with few bookings on the radar\u2014and on the eve of a tour to Russia as part of a cultural exchange agreement\u2014Ailey announced at a press conference that he was closing the company. In response, the State Department sponsored an Ailey tour of North Africa to tide things over. That August, the company toured to Russia where it was ecstatically received. Their performances were broadcast on Moscow television and seen by over 22 million viewers. On closing night, because the Russian audiences would not stop applauding, the company gave over 30 curtain calls. Returning home with news of this triumph, the company performed a two-week engagement at the [[ANTA Theatre|ANTA Theater]]. By the end of January 1971 performance, the entire run was sold out. After 13 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre was a monumental success. In August 1972 the company was briefly renamed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater and became a resident company of [[New York City Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/alvin-ailey-arsonist-modern-dance-is-getting-hot-then-in-april-of.html|title=Modern dance is getting hot|last=Cohn|first=Ellen|date=1973-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThough Ailey's work has been met with popular and critical acclaim, there have been detractors of his theatrical style.

They are as honest and truthful as we can make them. I'm interested in putting something on stage that will have a very wide appeal without being condescending; that will reach an audience and make it part of the dance; that will get everybody into the theater. If it's art and entertainment\u2014thank God, that's what I want to be.\"\n\nWhile Ailey choreographed more than 70 ballets for his dancers, he insisted that the company perform pieces by other choreographers rather than stand as a singular vehicle for his voice. In present-day the company continues this ethos by presenting major revivals and commissioning pieces from a wide range of choreographers. The company's repertoire contains over 200 ballets.\n\nThough AAADT was formed to celebrate African American culture and to provide performances for black dancers, who were frequently denied opportunities due to racist mores of the time, Ailey proudly employed artists based solely on artistic talent and integrity, regardless of their background.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newnownext.com/lgbt-black-history-month/01/2016/|title=9 LGBT People Of Color Who Changed History|work=LOGO News|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> In addition to his work as artistic director and choreographer with AADT, Ailey also choreographed ballets for other companies including American Ballet Theatre,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/arts/dance/29wilson.html|title=Sallie Wilson, 76, Dramatic Ballerina Famed for Antony Tudor Roles|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=2008-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Joffrey Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/arts/the-dance-3-works-by-ailey.html|title=The Dance: 3 Works by Ailey|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=1986-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and The Metropolitan Opera.

Their aim was to provide access to arts and dance to under-resourced communities. They started off in Brooklyn with 125 students. A year later the school relocated to Manhattan behind the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s complex. In 1984, [[Denise Jefferson]] assumed directorship. Under her leadership, the school developed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in partnership with Fordham University in 1998. The school was renamed The Ailey School in 1999. Several years later, the school moved into The Joan Weill Center for Dance. Following Jefferson's death in 2010, [[Tracy Inman]] and [[Melanie Person]] assumed stewardship of the school as co-directors of the school. In 2012, after leading Ailey 2 for 38 years, [[Sylvia Waters]] retired. The second company's resident choreographer and associate director [[Troy Powell]] took over her role as artistic director. With the addition of the Elaine Wynn and Family Education Wing, the Ailey school is still growing and is now the largest place in New York City committed to training dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaileyschool.edu/history-philosophy|title=History & Philosophy|date=2016-03-02|work=The Ailey School|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAiley loathed the label \"black choreographer\" and preferred being known simply as a choreographer.
