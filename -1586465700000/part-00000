{"title_page": "Line coordinates", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Coordinate lines}}\nIn [[geometry]], '''line coordinates''' are used to specify the position of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] just as point coordinates (or simply [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]) are used to specify the position of a point.\n\n==Lines in the plane==\nThere are several possible ways to specify the position of a line in the plane. A simple way is by the pair {{nowrap|(''m'', ''b'')}} where the equation of the line is ''y''&nbsp;= ''mx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''. Here ''m'' is the [[slope]] and ''b'' is the [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]]. This system specifies coordinates for all lines that are not vertical. However, it is more common and simpler algebraically to use coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'')}} where the equation of the line is ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This system specifies coordinates for all lines except those that pass through the origin. The geometrical interpretations of ''l'' and ''m'' are the negative reciprocals of the ''x'' and [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]] respectively.\n\nThe exclusion of lines passing through the origin can be resolved by using a system of three coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} to specify the line in which the equation, ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. Here ''l'' and ''m'' may not both be 0. In this equation, only the ratios between ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are significant, in other words if the coordinates are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then line represented remains the same. So {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} is a system of [[homogeneous coordinates]] for the line.\n\nIf points in the [[real projective plane]] are represented by homogeneous coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the equation of the line is ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''nz''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, provided {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') \u2260 (0,0,0) .}} In particular, line coordinate {{nowrap|(0, 0, 1)}} represents the line ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, which is the [[line at infinity]] in the [[projective plane]]. Line coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1, 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1, 0, 0)}} represent the ''x'' and ''y''-axes respectively.\n\n==Tangential equations==\nJust as ''f''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 can represent a [[curve]] as a subset of the points in the plane, the equation \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 represents a subset of the lines on the plane. The set of lines on the plane may, in an abstract sense, be thought of as the set of points in a projective plane, the [[Duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of the original plane. The equation \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 then represents a curve in the dual plane.\n\nFor a curve ''f''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in the plane, the [[tangent]]s to the curve form a curve in the dual space called the [[dual curve]]. If \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is the equation of the dual curve, then it is called the '''tangential equation''', for the original curve. A given equation \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 represents a curve in the original plane determined as the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the lines that satisfy this equation. Similarly, if \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'',&nbsp;''n'') is a [[homogeneous function]] then \u03c6(''l'',&nbsp;''m'',&nbsp;''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 represents a curve in the dual space given in homogeneous coordinates, and may be called the homogeneous tangential equation of the enveloped curve.\n\nTangential equations are useful in the study of curves defined as envelopes, just as Cartesian equations are useful in the study of curves defined as loci.\n\n==Tangential equation of a point==\nA linear equation in line coordinates has the form ''al''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''bm''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants. Suppose (''l'',&nbsp;''m'') is a line that satisfies this equation. If ''c'' is not 0 then ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, where ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''/''c'' and ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b''/''c'', so every line satisfying the original equation passes through the point (''x'',&nbsp;''y''). Conversely, any line through (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') satisfies the original equation, so ''al''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''bm''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is the equation of set of lines through (''x'',&nbsp;''y''). For a given point (''x'',&nbsp;''y''), the equation of the set of lines though it is ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, so this may be defined as the tangential equation of the point. Similarly, for a point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''z'') given in homogeneous coordinates, the equation of the point in homogeneous tangential coordinates is ''lx''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''my''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''nz''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\n==Formulas==\nThe intersection of the lines (''l''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>1</sub>) and (''l''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>2</sub>) is the solution to the linear equations\n\n:<math>l_1x+m_1y+1=0</math>\n\n:<math>l_2x+m_2y+1=0.</math>\n\nBy [[Cramer's rule]], the solution is\n\n:<math>x=\\frac{m_1-m_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1},\\,y=-\\frac{l_1-l_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1}.</math>\n\nThe lines (''l''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>1</sub>), (''l''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>2</sub>), and (''l''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>3</sub>) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  l_1 & m_1 & 1 \\\\\n  l_2 & m_2 & 1 \\\\\n  l_3 & m_3 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}=0.</math>\n\nFor homogeneous coordinates, the intersection of the lines (''l''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>) and (''l''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>2</sub>) is\n\n:<math>(m_1n_2-m_2n_1,\\,l_2n_1-l_1n_2,\\,l_1m_2-l_2m_1).</math>\n\nThe lines (''l''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>1</sub>), (''l''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>2</sub>) and (''l''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''m''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''n''<sub>3</sub>) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  l_1 & m_1 & n_1 \\\\\n  l_2 & m_2 & n_2 \\\\\n  l_3 & m_3 & n_3\n\\end{vmatrix}=0.</math>\n\nDually, the coordinates of the line containing (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>2</sub>) are\n:<math>(y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1).</math>\n\n==Lines in three-dimensional space==\n{{main|Pl\u00fccker coordinates}}\nFor two given points in the [[real projective plane]], (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>2</sub>), the three determinants\n\n:<math>y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1</math>\n\ndetermine the [[projective line]] containing them.\n\nSimilarly, for two points in '''RP'''<sup>3</sup>,  (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''w''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''z''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''w''<sub>2</sub>), the line containing them is determined by the six determinants\n\n:<math>x_1y_2-x_2y_1,\\,x_1z_2-x_1z_2,\\,y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\\,x_1w_2-x_2w_1,\\,y_1w_2-y_2w_1,\\,z_1w_2-z_2w_1.</math>\n\nThis is the basis for a system of homogeneous line coordinates in three-dimensional space called ''Pl\u00fccker coordinates''.

This eventually led to the substance receiving its present name, polystyrene.\n\nThe company [[IG Farben|I. G. Farben]] began manufacturing polystyrene in [[Ludwigshafen]], about 1931, hoping it would be a suitable replacement for die-cast [[zinc]] in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor vessel that extruded polystyrene through a heated tube and cutter, producing polystyrene in pellet form.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nOtis Ray McIntire (1918-1996) a chemical engineer of Dow Chemical rediscovered a process first patented by Swedish inventor Carl Munters.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.invent.org/inductees/otis-ray-mcintire | title = Otis Ray McIntire | publisher = National Inventor's Hall of Fame }}</ref> According to the Science History Institute, \"Dow bought the rights to Munters\u2019s method and began producing a lightweight, water-resistant, and buoyant material that seemed perfectly suited for building docks and watercraft and for insulating homes, offices, and chicken sheds.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/styrofoam-a-practical-and-problematic-creation | title = Styrofoam, a Practical and Problematic Creation | publisher = Science History Institute | date = July 31, 2018}}</ref> In 1944, [[Styrofoam]] was patented.\n\nBefore 1949, chemical engineer Fritz Stastny (1908\u20131985) developed pre-expanded PS beads by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane.

Polystyrene's chemical formula is {{chem|(C|8|H|8|)|n}}; it contains the [[chemical elements]] [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]].\n\nThe material's properties are determined by short-range [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] attractions between polymers chains. Since the molecules consist of thousands of atoms, the cumulative attractive force between the molecules is large.  When heated (or deformed at a rapid rate, due to a combination of viscoelastic and thermal insulation properties), the chains are able to take on a higher degree of conformation and slide past each other. This [[intermolecular]] weakness (versus the high ''[[Intramolecular force|intramolecular]]'' strength due to the hydrocarbon backbone) confers flexibility and elasticity.  The ability of the system to be readily deformed above its glass transition temperature allows polystyrene (and thermoplastic polymers in general) to be readily softened and molded upon heating. Extruded polystyrene is about as strong as an unalloyed [[aluminium]] but much more flexible and much less dense (1.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for polystyrene vs. 2.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for aluminium).\n\n===Production===\nPolystyrene results when styrene [[Monomer|monomers]] interconnect ([[polymerization]]). In the polymerisation, the carbon\u2013carbon [[pi bond|\u03c0 bond]] of the [[vinyl group]] is broken and a new carbon\u2013carbon [[sigma bond|\u03c3 bond]] is formed, attaching to the carbon of another styrene monomer to the chain.  The newly formed \u03c3 bond is stronger than the \u03c0 bond that was broken, thus it is difficult to depolymerize polystyrene.  About a few thousand monomers typically comprise a chain of polystyrene, giving a [[number average molecular weight|molecular weight]] of 100,000\u2013400,000 g/mol.\n\n[[File:Polystyrene formation.PNG|center]]\n\nEach carbon of the backbone has [[tetrahedral geometry]], and those carbons that have a [[phenyl group]] (benzene ring) attached are [[chirality (chemistry)|stereogenic]]. If the backbone were to be laid as a flat elongated zig-zag chain, each phenyl group would be tilted forward or backward compared to the plane of the chain.\n\nThe relative [[stereochemical]] relationship of consecutive phenyl groups determines the [[tacticity]], which has an effect on various physical properties of the material. \n\n===Tacticity===\n\nIn polystyrene, [[tacticity]] describes the extent to which the phenyl group is uniformly aligned (arranged at one side) in the polymer chain. Tacticity has a strong effect on the properties of the plastic. Standard polystyrene is atactic. The [[diastereomer]] where all of the phenyl groups are on the same side is called ''isotactic'' polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.\n\n[[File:Polystyrene tacticity en.svg]]\n\n====Atactic polystyrene====\nThe only commercially important form of polystyrene is ''atactic'', in which the phenyl groups are [[randomness|randomly]] distributed on both sides of the polymer chain. This random positioning prevents the chains from aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any [[crystallinity]]. The plastic has a glass transition temperature ''T''<sub>g</sub> of ~90&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Polymerisation is initiated with [[free radical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Maul, J.; Frushour, B. G.; Kontoff, J.

While it is waterproof, and resistant to breakdown by many acids and bases, it is easily attacked by many organic solvents (e.g. it dissolves quickly when exposed to [[acetone]]), chlorinated solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. Because of its resilience and inertness, it is used for fabricating many objects of commerce. Like other organic compounds, polystyrene burns to give [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water|water vapor]], in addition to other thermal degradation byproducts. Polystyrene, being an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]], typically combusts incompletely as indicated by the sooty flame.\n\nThe process of [[Depolymerization|depolymerizing]] polystyrene into its [[monomer]], [[styrene]], is called [[pyrolysis]]. This involves using high heat and pressure to break down the chemical bonds between each styrene compound. Pyrolysis usually goes up to 430&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=336|title=What is Pyrolysis?|date=2012-12-29|website=AZoCleantech.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The high energy cost of doing this has made commercial recycling of polystyrene back into styrene monomer difficult.\n\n===Organisms===\nPolystyrene is generally considered to be non-biodegradable.

EPS is used for [[foam food container|food containers]], molded sheets for [[building insulation]], and packing material either as solid blocks formed to accommodate the item being protected or as loose-fill [[foam peanut|\"peanuts\"]] [[cushioning]] fragile items inside boxes. A significant portion of all EPS products are manufactured through injection molding. Mold tools tend to be manufactured from steels (which can be hardened and plated), and aluminum alloys. The molds are controlled through a split via a channel system of gates and runners.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/processes/moulding_eps.aspx | title=Moulding Expanded Polystyrene (EPS)}}</ref> EPS is colloquially called \"styrofoam\" in the United States and Canada, an incorrectly applied [[Generic trademark|genericization]] of Dow Chemical's [[Styrofoam|brand of ''extruded'' polystyrene]].<ref name=\"what-is-styrofoam\">{{cite web|url=http://building.dow.com/styrofoam/what.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324134328/http://building.dow.com/styrofoam/what.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-03-24 |title=Dow Chemical Company Styrofoam page |accessdate=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n=====EPS in building construction=====\nSheets of EPS are commonly packaged as [[rigid panel]]s (Common in Europe is a size of 100cmx50cm, usually depending on an intended type of connection and glue techniques, it is in fact 99.5cmx49.5&nbsp;cm or 98cmx48cm; less common is 120x60cm ; size 4 by 8 or 2 by 8 feet in the United States). Common thicknesses are from 10mm to 500mm. Many customization, additives and thin additional external layers on one or both sides, are often added to help with various properties.\n\n[[Thermal conductivity]] is measured according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m\u00b7K) depending on the density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 W/(m\u00b7K) was obtained at 15&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> while the value of 0.032 W/(m\u00b7K) was obtained at 40&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> according to the data sheet of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030\u20130.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK & EU.\n\nWater vapor [[diffusion resistance]] (\u03bc) of EPS is around 30\u201370.\n\nICC-ES ([[International Code Council]] Evaluation Service) requires EPS boards used in building construction meet ASTM C578 requirements. One of these requirements is that the [[limiting oxygen index]] of EPS as measured by ASTM D2863 be greater than 24 volume %. Typical EPS has an oxygen index of around 18 volume %; thus, a flame retardant is added to styrene or polystyrene during the formation of EPS.\n\nThe boards containing a flame retardant when tested in a tunnel using test method UL 723 or ASTM E84 will have a flame spread index of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450. ICC-ES requires the use of a 15-minute thermal barrier when EPS boards are used inside of a building.\n\nAccording to EPS-IA ICF organization, the typical density of EPS used for insulated concrete forms ([[expanded polystyrene concrete]]) is 1.35 to 1.80 pcf. This is either Type II or Type IX EPS according to ASTM C578. EPS blocks or boards used in building construction are commonly cut using hot wires.<ref>''[http://www.ceresana.com/en/insight/products/plastics/expandable-polystyrene/ Expandable Polystyrene]'', Insight database from Ceresana Research</ref>\n\n====Extruded polystyrene (XPS) ====\n{{anchor|Extruded polystyrene foam}}\n{{see also|Styrofoam}}\nExtruded polystyrene foam (XPS) consists of closed cells. It offers improved surface roughness, higher stiffness and reduced thermal conductivity. The density range is about 28\u201345&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.\n\nExtruded polystyrene material is also used in [[craft]]s and [[Physical model|model]] building, in particular [[Architecture|architectural]] models. Because of the extrusion manufacturing process, XPS does not require facers to maintain its thermal or physical property performance. Thus, it makes a more uniform substitute for [[corrugated cardboard]]. Thermal conductivity varies between 0.029 and 0.039 W/(m\u00b7K) depending on bearing strength/density and the average value is ~0.035 W/(m\u00b7K).\n\nWater vapour diffusion resistance (\u03bc) of XPS is around 80\u2013250.\n\n==== Water absorption of polystyrene foams ====\nAlthough it is a closed-cell foam, both expanded and extruded polystyrene are not entirely waterproof or vaporproof.<ref>Gnip, Ivan et al.

This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product.  Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other clear plastics such as [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage to OPS is that it is brittle, and will crack or tear easily.\n\n==Copolymers==\nOrdinary ([[homopolymeric]]) polystyrene has an excellent property profile with regard to transparency, surface quality and stiffness. Its range of applications is further extended by [[copolymerization]] and other modifications ([[Polymer blend|blends]] e.g. with [[Polycarbonate|PC]] and syndiotactic polystyrene).<ref>[[Wilhelm Keim|W. Keim]]: ''Kunststoffe: Synthese, Herstellungsverfahren, Apparaturen'', 379 Seiten, Verlag Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 1.

Copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile ([[Styrene-acrylonitrile resin|SAN]]) are more resistant to thermal stress, heat and chemicals than homopolymers and are also transparent. Copolymers called [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] have similar properties and can be used at low temperatures, but they are [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].\n\n=== Styrene-butadiene copolymers ===\nStyrene-butadiene copolymers can be produced with a low [[1-Butene|butene]] content. Styrene-butadiene copolymers include PS-I and SBC (see below), both copolymers are [[Impact resistance|impact resistant]]. PS-I is prepared by [[Graft polymerization|graft copolymerization]], SBC by anionic block copolymerization, which makes it [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] in case of appropriate block size.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00dcbersicht Polystyrol auf chemgapedia.de|url=http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/de/ch/9/mac/werkstoff_polystyren/sorten/sorten.vlu/Page/vsc/de/ch/9/mac/werkstoff_polystyren/sorten/copolymere/uebersicht.vscml.html}}</ref>\n\nIf styrene-butadiene copolymer has a high butylene content, [[styrene-butadiene rubber]] (SBR) is formed.\n\nThe impact strength of styrene-butadiene copolymers is based on phase separation, polystyrene and polybutadiene are not soluble in each other (see [[Flory-Huggins theory]]). Copolymerization creates a boundary layer without complete mixing. The butadiene fractions (the \"rubber phase\") assemble to form particles embedded in a polystyrene matrix. A decisive factor for the improved impact strength of styrene-butadiene copolymers is their higher absorption capacity for deformation work. Without applied force, the rubber phase initially behaves like a [[Filler (materials)|filler]]. Under tensile stress, [[Crazing|crazes]] (microcracks) are formed, which spread to the rubber particles. The energy of the propagating crack is then transferred to the rubber particles along its path. A large number of cracks gives the originally rigid material a laminated structure. The formation of each individual lamella contributes to the consumption of energy and thus to an increase in elongation at break. Polystyrene homopolymers deform when a force is applied until they break. Styrene-butadiene copolymers do not break at this point, but begin to flow, solidifie to tensile strength and only break at much higher elongation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kunststoffe : Eigenschaften und Anwendungen|last=Domininghaus, Hans.|date=2012|publisher=Springer|others=Elsner, Peter., Eyerer, Peter., Hirth, Thomas.|isbn=9783642161735|edition=8., neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage|location=Heidelberg|oclc=834590709}}</ref>{{rp|426}}\n\nWith a high proportion of polybutadiene, the effect of the two phases is reversed.

For the production of SBS, the first styrene is homopolymerized via anionic copolymerization. Typically, an organometallic compound such as butyllithium is used as a catalyst. Butadiene is then added and after styrene again its polymerization. The catalyst remains active during the whole process (for which the used chemicals must be of high purity). The [[molecular weight distribution]] of the polymers is very low ([[polydispersity]] in the range of 1.05, the individual chains have thus very similar lengths). The length of the individual blocks can be adjusted by the ratio of catalyst to monomer. The size of the rubber sections, in turn, depends on the block length. The production of small structures (smaller than the wavelength of the light) ensure transparency. In contrast to PS-I, however, the block copolymer does not form any particles but has a lamellar structure.\n\n==== Styrene-butadiene rubber ====\n{{main article|Styrene-butadiene}}\n\nStyrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is produced like PS-I by graft copolymerization, but with a lower styrene content. Styrene-butadiene rubber thus consists of a rubber matrix with a polystyrene phase dispersed therein.<ref name=\"Pfropfcopolymere\" /> Unlike PS-I and SBC, it is not a [[thermoplastic]], but an [[elastomer]]. Within the rubber phase, the polystyrene phase is assembled into domains. This causes physical cross-linking on a microscopic level. When the material is heated above the glass transition point, the domains disintegrate, the cross-linking is temporarily suspended and the material can be processed like a thermoplastic.<ref>{{cite web|title=styrenic block copolymers - IISRP|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://iisrp.com/wp-content/uploads/08SBC16Aug2012.pdf|accessdate=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\nWithin the rubber phase, the polystyrene phase is stored together to form domains.

In Germany, polystyrene is collected, as a consequence of the packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling or disposing of any packaging material they sell.\n\nMost polystyrene products are currently not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 330&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.<ref>https://expandedpoly.co.uk/environment/ Polystyrene recycling.

This eventually led to the substance receiving its present name, polystyrene.\n\nThe company [[IG Farben|I. G.

Polystyrene's chemical formula is {{chem|(C|8|H|8|)|n}}; it contains the [[chemical elements]] [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]].\n\nThe material's properties are determined by short-range [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] attractions between polymers chains. Since the molecules consist of thousands of atoms, the cumulative attractive force between the molecules is large.  When heated (or deformed at a rapid rate, due to a combination of viscoelastic and thermal insulation properties), the chains are able to take on a higher degree of conformation and slide past each other. This [[intermolecular]] weakness (versus the high ''[[Intramolecular force|intramolecular]]'' strength due to the hydrocarbon backbone) confers flexibility and elasticity.  The ability of the system to be readily deformed above its glass transition temperature allows polystyrene (and thermoplastic polymers in general) to be readily softened and molded upon heating. Extruded polystyrene is about as strong as an unalloyed [[aluminium]] but much more flexible and much less dense (1.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for polystyrene vs. 2.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for aluminium).\n\n===Production===\nPolystyrene results when styrene [[Monomer|monomers]] interconnect ([[polymerization]]). In the polymerisation, the carbon\u2013carbon [[pi bond|\u03c0 bond]] of the [[vinyl group]] is broken and a new carbon\u2013carbon [[sigma bond|\u03c3 bond]] is formed, attaching to the carbon of another styrene monomer to the chain.  The newly formed \u03c3 bond is stronger than the \u03c0 bond that was broken, thus it is difficult to depolymerize polystyrene.  About a few thousand monomers typically comprise a chain of polystyrene, giving a [[number average molecular weight|molecular weight]] of 100,000\u2013400,000 g/mol.\n\n[[File:Polystyrene formation.PNG|center]]\n\nEach carbon of the backbone has [[tetrahedral geometry]], and those carbons that have a [[phenyl group]] (benzene ring) attached are [[chirality (chemistry)|stereogenic]]. If the backbone were to be laid as a flat elongated zig-zag chain, each phenyl group would be tilted forward or backward compared to the plane of the chain.\n\nThe relative [[stereochemical]] relationship of consecutive phenyl groups determines the [[tacticity]], which has an effect on various physical properties of the material. \n\n===Tacticity===\n\nIn polystyrene, [[tacticity]] describes the extent to which the phenyl group is uniformly aligned (arranged at one side) in the polymer chain. Tacticity has a strong effect on the properties of the plastic. Standard polystyrene is atactic. The [[diastereomer]] where all of the phenyl groups are on the same side is called ''isotactic'' polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.\n\n[[File:Polystyrene tacticity en.svg]]\n\n====Atactic polystyrene====\nThe only commercially important form of polystyrene is ''atactic'', in which the phenyl groups are [[randomness|randomly]] distributed on both sides of the polymer chain. This random positioning prevents the chains from aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any [[crystallinity]]. The plastic has a glass transition temperature ''T''<sub>g</sub> of ~90&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Polymerisation is initiated with [[free radical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Maul, J.; Frushour, B. G.; Kontoff, J.

While it is waterproof, and resistant to breakdown by many acids and bases, it is easily attacked by many organic solvents (e.g. it dissolves quickly when exposed to [[acetone]]), chlorinated solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. Because of its resilience and inertness, it is used for fabricating many objects of commerce. Like other organic compounds, polystyrene burns to give [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water|water vapor]], in addition to other thermal degradation byproducts. Polystyrene, being an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]], typically combusts incompletely as indicated by the sooty flame.\n\nThe process of [[Depolymerization|depolymerizing]] polystyrene into its [[monomer]], [[styrene]], is called [[pyrolysis]]. This involves using high heat and pressure to break down the chemical bonds between each styrene compound. Pyrolysis usually goes up to 430&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=336|title=What is Pyrolysis?|date=2012-12-29|website=AZoCleantech.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> The high energy cost of doing this has made commercial recycling of polystyrene back into styrene monomer difficult.\n\n===Organisms===\nPolystyrene is generally considered to be non-biodegradable.

Common thicknesses are from 10mm to 500mm. Many customization, additives and thin additional external layers on one or both sides, are often added to help with various properties.\n\n[[Thermal conductivity]] is measured according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m\u00b7K) depending on the density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 W/(m\u00b7K) was obtained at 15&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> while the value of 0.032 W/(m\u00b7K) was obtained at 40&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> according to the data sheet of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030\u20130.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK & EU.\n\nWater vapor [[diffusion resistance]] (\u03bc) of EPS is around 30\u201370.\n\nICC-ES ([[International Code Council]] Evaluation Service) requires EPS boards used in building construction meet ASTM C578 requirements. One of these requirements is that the [[limiting oxygen index]] of EPS as measured by ASTM D2863 be greater than 24 volume %. Typical EPS has an oxygen index of around 18 volume %; thus, a flame retardant is added to styrene or polystyrene during the formation of EPS.\n\nThe boards containing a flame retardant when tested in a tunnel using test method UL 723 or ASTM E84 will have a flame spread index of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450. ICC-ES requires the use of a 15-minute thermal barrier when EPS boards are used inside of a building.\n\nAccording to EPS-IA ICF organization, the typical density of EPS used for insulated concrete forms ([[expanded polystyrene concrete]]) is 1.35 to 1.80 pcf. This is either Type II or Type IX EPS according to ASTM C578. EPS blocks or boards used in building construction are commonly cut using hot wires.<ref>''[http://www.ceresana.com/en/insight/products/plastics/expandable-polystyrene/ Expandable Polystyrene]'', Insight database from Ceresana Research</ref>\n\n====Extruded polystyrene (XPS) ====\n{{anchor|Extruded polystyrene foam}}\n{{see also|Styrofoam}}\nExtruded polystyrene foam (XPS) consists of closed cells. It offers improved surface roughness, higher stiffness and reduced thermal conductivity. The density range is about 28\u201345&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.\n\nExtruded polystyrene material is also used in [[craft]]s and [[Physical model|model]] building, in particular [[Architecture|architectural]] models. Because of the extrusion manufacturing process, XPS does not require facers to maintain its thermal or physical property performance. Thus, it makes a more uniform substitute for [[corrugated cardboard]]. Thermal conductivity varies between 0.029 and 0.039 W/(m\u00b7K) depending on bearing strength/density and the average value is ~0.035 W/(m\u00b7K).\n\nWater vapour diffusion resistance (\u03bc) of XPS is around 80\u2013250.\n\n==== Water absorption of polystyrene foams ====\nAlthough it is a closed-cell foam, both expanded and extruded polystyrene are not entirely waterproof or vaporproof.<ref>Gnip, Ivan et al.

This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product.  Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other clear plastics such as [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage to OPS is that it is brittle, and will crack or tear easily.\n\n==Copolymers==\nOrdinary ([[homopolymeric]]) polystyrene has an excellent property profile with regard to transparency, surface quality and stiffness. Its range of applications is further extended by [[copolymerization]] and other modifications ([[Polymer blend|blends]] e.g. with [[Polycarbonate|PC]] and syndiotactic polystyrene).<ref>[[Wilhelm Keim|W. Keim]]: ''Kunststoffe: Synthese, Herstellungsverfahren, Apparaturen'', 379 Seiten, Verlag Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 1.

Copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile ([[Styrene-acrylonitrile resin|SAN]]) are more resistant to thermal stress, heat and chemicals than homopolymers and are also transparent. Copolymers called [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] have similar properties and can be used at low temperatures, but they are [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].\n\n=== Styrene-butadiene copolymers ===\nStyrene-butadiene copolymers can be produced with a low [[1-Butene|butene]] content. Styrene-butadiene copolymers include PS-I and SBC (see below), both copolymers are [[Impact resistance|impact resistant]].

Copolymerization creates a boundary layer without complete mixing. The butadiene fractions (the \"rubber phase\") assemble to form particles embedded in a polystyrene matrix. A decisive factor for the improved impact strength of styrene-butadiene copolymers is their higher absorption capacity for deformation work. Without applied force, the rubber phase initially behaves like a [[Filler (materials)|filler]]. Under tensile stress, [[Crazing|crazes]] (microcracks) are formed, which spread to the rubber particles. The energy of the propagating crack is then transferred to the rubber particles along its path. A large number of cracks gives the originally rigid material a laminated structure. The formation of each individual lamella contributes to the consumption of energy and thus to an increase in elongation at break. Polystyrene homopolymers deform when a force is applied until they break. Styrene-butadiene copolymers do not break at this point, but begin to flow, solidifie to tensile strength and only break at much higher elongation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kunststoffe : Eigenschaften und Anwendungen|last=Domininghaus, Hans.|date=2012|publisher=Springer|others=Elsner, Peter., Eyerer, Peter., Hirth, Thomas.|isbn=9783642161735|edition=8., neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage|location=Heidelberg|oclc=834590709}}</ref>{{rp|426}}\n\nWith a high proportion of polybutadiene, the effect of the two phases is reversed.

For the production of SBS, the first styrene is homopolymerized via anionic copolymerization. Typically, an organometallic compound such as butyllithium is used as a catalyst. Butadiene is then added and after styrene again its polymerization. The catalyst remains active during the whole process (for which the used chemicals must be of high purity). The [[molecular weight distribution]] of the polymers is very low ([[polydispersity]] in the range of 1.05, the individual chains have thus very similar lengths). The length of the individual blocks can be adjusted by the ratio of catalyst to monomer. The size of the rubber sections, in turn, depends on the block length. The production of small structures (smaller than the wavelength of the light) ensure transparency. In contrast to PS-I, however, the block copolymer does not form any particles but has a lamellar structure.\n\n==== Styrene-butadiene rubber ====\n{{main article|Styrene-butadiene}}\n\nStyrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is produced like PS-I by graft copolymerization, but with a lower styrene content. Styrene-butadiene rubber thus consists of a rubber matrix with a polystyrene phase dispersed therein.<ref name=\"Pfropfcopolymere\" /> Unlike PS-I and SBC, it is not a [[thermoplastic]], but an [[elastomer]]. Within the rubber phase, the polystyrene phase is assembled into domains. This causes physical cross-linking on a microscopic level.

In Germany, polystyrene is collected, as a consequence of the packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling or disposing of any packaging material they sell.\n\nMost polystyrene products are currently not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 330&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.<ref>https://expandedpoly.co.uk/environment/ Polystyrene recycling.

Both programmers worked on [[Xerox]] [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], the first [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) [[word processor]]. The first Word version, Word 1.0, was released in October 1983 for [[Xenix]] and [[MS-DOS]]; it was followed by four very similar versions that were not very successful. The first Windows version was released in 1989, with a slightly improved interface. <span lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">When</span> Windows 3.0 was released in 1990, Word became a huge commercial success. Word for Windows 1.0 was followed by Word 2.0 in 1991 and Word 6.0 in 1993. Then it was renamed to Word 95 and Word 97, Word 2000 and Word for [[Office XP]] (to follow Windows commercial names). With the release of Word 2003, the numbering was again year-based. Since then, Windows versions include Word 2007, Word 2010, Word 2013, Word 2016, and most recently, Word for Office 365. \n\nIn 1986, an agreement between [[Atari]] and Microsoft brought Word to the [[Atari ST]].<ref name=\"Microsoft Write for Atari ST\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue77/News_Products.php?tag= Atari announces agreement with Microsoft]</ref> The Atari ST version was a translation of Word 1.05 for the Apple Macintosh; however, it was released under the name [[Microsoft Write]] (the name of the word processor included with Windows during the 80s and early 90s).<ref name=\"Microsoft Write for Atari ST review\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/microsoftwrite.html?tag= Feature Review: Microsoft Write]</ref><ref name=\"Microsoft Word for Atari ST\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n11/ataricorp.html?tag= Today's Atari Corp.: A close up look inside]</ref> Unlike other versions of Word, the Atari version was a one time release with no future updates or revisions. The release of Microsoft Write was one of two major PC applications that were released for the Atari ST (the other application being WordPerfect). Microsoft Write was released for the Atari ST in 1988.\n\nIn 2014 the [[source code]] for Word for Windows in the version 1.1a was made available to the [[Computer History Museum]] and the public for educational purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/microsoft-word-for-windows-1-1a-source-code/|title=Microsoft Word for Windows Version 1.1a Source Code |first=Len |last=Shustek |date=2014-03-24 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/25/microsoft-makes-source-code-for-ms-dos-and-word-for-windows-available-to-public.aspx|title=Microsoft makes source code for MS-DOS and Word for Windows available to public|date=2014-03-25|first=Roy|last=Levin|work=Official Microsoft Blog|accessdate=2014-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328094124/http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/25/microsoft-makes-source-code-for-ms-dos-and-word-for-windows-available-to-public.aspx|archive-date=2014-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Word for DOS==\nThe first Microsoft Word was released in 1983. It featured graphics video mode and mouse support in a WYSIWYG interface. It could run in text mode or graphics mode but the visual difference between the two was minor. In graphics mode, the document and interface were rendered in a fixed font size monospace character grid with italic, bold and underline features that was not available in text mode. It had support for style sheets in separate files (.STY).\n\nThe first version of Word was a 16 bits PC DOS/MS-DOS application. A Macintosh 68000 version named Word 1.0 was released in 1985 and a Microsoft Windows version was released in 1989. The three products shared the same Microsoft Word name, the same version numbers but were very different products built on different code bases. Three product lines co-existed: Word 1.0 to Word 5.1a<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/06/word-refuseniks-never-upgrade/|title=Word Refuseniks: Never Upgrade |date=2004-06-17 |accessdate=2019-12-21}}</ref> for Macintosh, Word 1.0 to Word 2.0 for Windows and Word 1.0 to Word 5.5 for DOS.\n\nWord 1.1 for DOS was released in 1984 and added the Print Merge support, equivalent to the Mail Merge feature in newer Word systems.\n\nWord 2.0 for DOS was released in 1985 and featured Extended Graphics Adapter (EGA) support.\n\nWord 3.0 for DOS, released in 1986, added support for revision marks (equivalent to the Track Changes feature in more recent Word versions), search/replace by style and macros stored as key stroke sequences.\n\nWord 4.0 for DOS was released in 1987.\n\nWord 5.0 for DOS, released in 1989, added support for bookmarks, cross-references and conditions and loops in macros, remaining backwards compatible with Word 3.0 macros. The macro language differed from the WinWord 1.0 WordBasic macro language.\n\nWord 5.5 for DOS, released in 1990, significantly changed the user interface, with popup menus and dialog boxes. Even in graphics mode, these Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements got the monospace ASCII art look and feel found in text mode programs like Microsoft QuickBasic.\n\nWord 6.0 for DOS, the last Word for DOS version, was released in 1993, at the same time as Word 6.0 for Windows (16 bits) and Word 6.0 for Macintosh.

However, version 6.0 for the Macintosh, released in 1994, was widely derided, unlike the Windows version. It was the first version of Word based on a common code base between the Windows and Mac versions; many accused the Mac version of being slow, clumsy and memory intensive.\n\nWith the release of Word 6.0 in 1993 Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms; this time across the three versions for DOS, Macintosh, and Windows (where the previous version was Word for Windows 2.0). There may have also been thought given to matching the current version 6.0 of WordPerfect for DOS and Windows, Word's major competitor. However, this wound up being the last version of Word for DOS. In addition, subsequent versions of Word were no longer referred to by version number, and were instead named after the year of their release (e.g. Word 95 for Windows, synchronizing its name with Windows 95, and Word 98 for Macintosh), once again breaking the synchronization.\n\nWhen Microsoft became aware of the [[Year 2000 problem]], it released the entire DOS port of Microsoft Word 5.5 instead of getting people to pay for the update.

The first, code-named Pyramid, had been an attempt to completely rewrite the existing product. It was abandoned when Chris Peters replaced Jeff Raikes at the lead developer of the Word project<ref>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/02/26/mac-word-6-0/</ref> and determined it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added in the same time without a rewrite. Therefore, Word 6.0 for Windows and Macintosh were both derived from Word 2.0 for Windows code base. The Word 3.0 to 5.0 for Windows version numbers were skipped (outside of DBCS locales) in order to keep the version numbers consistent between Macintosh and Windows versions. Supporters of Pyramid claimed that it would have been faster, smaller, and more stable than the product that was eventually released for Macintosh, and which was compiled using a beta version of Visual C++ 2.0 that targets the Macintosh, so many optimizations have to be turned off (the version 4.2.1 of Office is compiled using the final version), and sometimes use the Windows API simulation library included.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx |title=Buggin' My Life Away: Mac Word 6.0 |access-date=2009-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040514091238/http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx |archive-date=2004-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pyramid would have been truly cross-platform, with machine-independent application code and a small mediation layer between the application and the [[operating system]].\n\nMore recent versions of Word for Macintosh are no longer ported versions of Word for Windows.\n\nLater versions of Word have more capabilities than merely word processing. The drawing tool allows simple [[desktop publishing]] operations, such as adding graphics to documents.\n\n==Microsoft Office==\n\n===Word 95===\n\nWord 95 was released as part of Office 95 and was numbered 7.0, consistently with all Office components. It ran exclusively on the Win32 platform, but otherwise had few new features. The file format did not change.\n\n===Word 97===\n\nWord 97 had the same general operating performance as later versions such as Word 2000. This was the first copy of Word featuring the [[Office Assistant]], \"Clippit\", which was an animated helper used in all Office programs. This was a takeover from the earlier launched concept in [[Microsoft Bob]]. Word 97 introduced the macro programming language [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) which remains in use in Word 2016.\n\n===Word 98===\n\nWord 98 for the Macintosh gained many features of Word 97, and was bundled with the Macintosh Office 98 package. Document compatibility reached parity with Office 97 and Word on the Mac became a viable business alternative to its Windows counterpart. Unfortunately, Word on the Mac in this and later releases also became vulnerable to future macro viruses that could compromise Word (and Excel) documents, leading to the only situation where viruses could be cross-platform. A Windows version of this was only bundled with the Japanese/Korean Microsoft Office 97 Powered By Word 98 and could not be purchased separately. It was then released in the same period as well.\n\n===Word 2000===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2000}}\n\n===Word 2001/Word X===\n\nWord 2001 was bundled with the Macintosh Office for that platform, acquiring most, if not all, of the feature set of Word 2000. Released in October 2000, Word 2001 was also sold as an individual product. The Macintosh version, Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on (and required) [[Mac OS X]].\n\n===Word 2002/XP===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office XP}}\nWord 2002 was bundled with Office XP and was released in 2001. It had many of the same features as Word 2000, but had a major new feature called the 'Task Panes', which gave quicker information and control to a lot of features that were before only available in modal dialog boxes. One of the key advertising strategies for the software was the removal of the Office Assistant in favor of a new help system, although it was simply disabled by default.\n\n===Word 2003===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2003}}\nMicrosoft Office 2003 is an office suite developed and distributed by Microsoft for its Windows operating system. Office 2003 was released to manufacturing on August 19, 2003, and was later released to retail on October 21, 2003. It was the successor to Office XP and the predecessor to Office 2007.\n\n===Word 2004===\n\nA new Macintosh version of Office was released in May 2004. Substantial cleanup of the various applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and feature parity with Office 2003 (for [[Microsoft Windows]]) created a very usable release. Microsoft released patches through the years to eliminate most known macro vulnerabilities from this version. While Apple released Pages and the open source community created NeoOffice, Word remains the most widely used word processor on the Macintosh. Office 2004 for Mac is a version of Microsoft Office developed for Mac OS X. It is equivalent to Office 2003 for Windows. The software was originally written for PowerPC Macs, so Macs with Intel CPUs must run the program under Mac OS X's Rosetta emulation layer.\nAlso: Stable release: v11.6.6 / December 13, 2011; 7 years ago\n\n===Word 2007===\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2007}}\nThe release includes numerous changes, including a new XML-based file format, a redesigned interface, an integrated equation editor and [[bibliographic]] management. Additionally, an XML data bag was introduced, accessible via the object model and file format, called Custom XML \u2013 this can be used in conjunction with a new feature called Content Controls to implement structured documents. It also has contextual tabs, which are functionality specific only to the object with focus, and many other features like Live Preview (which enables you to view the document without making any permanent changes), Mini Toolbar, Super-tooltips, Quick Access toolbar, SmartArt, etc.\n\nWord 2007 uses a new file format called docx. Word 2000\u20132003 users on Windows systems can install a free add-on called the \"Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack\" to be able to open, edit, and save the new Word 2007 files.<ref>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&displaylang=en Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats</ref> Alternatively, Word 2007 can save to the old doc format of Word 97\u20132003.<ref>https://archive.is/20120715033535/http://techrepublic.com.com/5208-6230-0.html?forumID=102&threadID=218738&messageID=2212198 How to save as doc in Word 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walterglenn.com/2007/01/13/save-as-doc-instead-of-docx-in-word-2007/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324130734/http://www.walterglenn.com/2007/01/13/save-as-doc-instead-of-docx-in-word-2007/ |archivedate=2010-03-24 }} How to configure Word 2007 to always save as doc</ref>\n\n===Word 2008===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac}}\nWord 2008 was released on January 15, 2008. It includes some new features from Word 2007, such as a ribbon-like feature that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. Word 2008 also features native support for the new Office Open XML format, although the old doc format can be set as a default.<ref>The default format can be changed under preferences \u2192 save \u2192 dropdown menu [http://www.ehmac.ca/mac-ipod-help-troubleshooting/60852-changing-word-2008-default-format.html]</ref>\nMicrosoft Office 2008 for Mac is a version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite for Mac OS X. It supersedes Office 2004 for Mac and is the Mac OS X equivalent of Office 2007. Office 2008 was developed by Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit and released on January 15, 2008.\n\n===Word 2010===\nMicrosoft Office 2010 is a version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite for Microsoft Windows. Office 2010 was released to manufacturing on April 15, 2010, and was later made available for retail and online purchase on June 15, 2010. It is the successor to Office 2007 and the predecessor to Office 2013.\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2010}}\n\n===Word 2011===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office for Mac 2011}}\n\n===Word 2013===\nThe release of Word 2013 has brought Word a cleaner look and this version focuses further on [[Cloud Computing]] with documents being saved automatically to [[OneDrive]] (previously Skydrive). If enabled, documents and settings roam with the user. Other notable features are a new read mode which allows for horizontal scrolling of pages in columns, a bookmark to find where the user left off reading their document and opening PDF documents in Word just like Word content. The version released for the [[Windows 8]] operating system is modified for use with a [[touchscreen]] and on tablets. It is the first version of Word to ''not'' run on [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]].<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624351.aspx Microsoft Technet System Requirements for Office 2013]</ref>\n\n=== Word 2016 ===\n{{see also|Microsoft Office 2016}}\nOn July 9, 2015, Microsoft Word 16 was released. Features include the tell me, share and faster shape formatting options. Other useful features include realtime collaboration, which allows users to store documents on Share Point or OneDrive, as well as an improved version history and a smart lookup tool. As usual, several editions of the program were released, including one for home and one for business.\n\n=== Word 2019 ===\n{{see also|Microsoft Office 2019}}\nWord 2019 added support for [[Scalable Vector Graphics]], [[Microsoft Translator]], and [[LaTeX]], as well as expanded drawing functionality.<ref>[https://helpdeskgeek.com/office-tips/whats-new-in-microsoft-office-2019/ What's New in Microsoft Office 2019 \u2014 HelpdeskGeek]</ref>\n\n=== Word included with Office 365 ===\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a free/paid subscription plan for the classic Office applications.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tsang, Cheryl.

Both programmers worked on [[Xerox]] [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], the first [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) [[word processor]]. The first Word version, Word 1.0, was released in October 1983 for [[Xenix]] and [[MS-DOS]]; it was followed by four very similar versions that were not very successful. The first Windows version was released in 1989, with a slightly improved interface. <span lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">When</span> Windows 3.0 was released in 1990, Word became a huge commercial success. Word for Windows 1.0 was followed by Word 2.0 in 1991 and Word 6.0 in 1993. Then it was renamed to Word 95 and Word 97, Word 2000 and Word for [[Office XP]] (to follow Windows commercial names). With the release of Word 2003, the numbering was again year-based. Since then, Windows versions include Word 2007, Word 2010, Word 2013, Word 2016, and most recently, Word for Office 365. \n\nIn 1986, an agreement between [[Atari]] and Microsoft brought Word to the [[Atari ST]].<ref name=\"Microsoft Write for Atari ST\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue77/News_Products.php?tag= Atari announces agreement with Microsoft]</ref> The Atari ST version was a translation of Word 1.05 for the Apple Macintosh; however, it was released under the name [[Microsoft Write]] (the name of the word processor included with Windows during the 80s and early 90s).<ref name=\"Microsoft Write for Atari ST review\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/microsoftwrite.html?tag= Feature Review: Microsoft Write]</ref><ref name=\"Microsoft Word for Atari ST\">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n11/ataricorp.html?tag= Today's Atari Corp.: A close up look inside]</ref> Unlike other versions of Word, the Atari version was a one time release with no future updates or revisions. The release of Microsoft Write was one of two major PC applications that were released for the Atari ST (the other application being WordPerfect). Microsoft Write was released for the Atari ST in 1988.\n\nIn 2014 the [[source code]] for Word for Windows in the version 1.1a was made available to the [[Computer History Museum]] and the public for educational purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/microsoft-word-for-windows-1-1a-source-code/|title=Microsoft Word for Windows Version 1.1a Source Code |first=Len |last=Shustek |date=2014-03-24 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/25/microsoft-makes-source-code-for-ms-dos-and-word-for-windows-available-to-public.aspx|title=Microsoft makes source code for MS-DOS and Word for Windows available to public|date=2014-03-25|first=Roy|last=Levin|work=Official Microsoft Blog|accessdate=2014-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328094124/http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/25/microsoft-makes-source-code-for-ms-dos-and-word-for-windows-available-to-public.aspx|archive-date=2014-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Word for DOS==\nThe first Microsoft Word was released in 1983. It featured graphics video mode and mouse support in a WYSIWYG interface. It could run in text mode or graphics mode but the visual difference between the two was minor. In graphics mode, the document and interface were rendered in a fixed font size monospace character grid with italic, bold and underline features that was not available in text mode. It had support for style sheets in separate files (.STY).\n\nThe first version of Word was a 16 bits PC DOS/MS-DOS application. A Macintosh 68000 version named Word 1.0 was released in 1985 and a Microsoft Windows version was released in 1989. The three products shared the same Microsoft Word name, the same version numbers but were very different products built on different code bases. Three product lines co-existed: Word 1.0 to Word 5.1a<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/06/word-refuseniks-never-upgrade/|title=Word Refuseniks: Never Upgrade |date=2004-06-17 |accessdate=2019-12-21}}</ref> for Macintosh, Word 1.0 to Word 2.0 for Windows and Word 1.0 to Word 5.5 for DOS.\n\nWord 1.1 for DOS was released in 1984 and added the Print Merge support, equivalent to the Mail Merge feature in newer Word systems.\n\nWord 2.0 for DOS was released in 1985 and featured Extended Graphics Adapter (EGA) support.\n\nWord 3.0 for DOS, released in 1986, added support for revision marks (equivalent to the Track Changes feature in more recent Word versions), search/replace by style and macros stored as key stroke sequences.\n\nWord 4.0 for DOS was released in 1987.\n\nWord 5.0 for DOS, released in 1989, added support for bookmarks, cross-references and conditions and loops in macros, remaining backwards compatible with Word 3.0 macros. The macro language differed from the WinWord 1.0 WordBasic macro language.\n\nWord 5.5 for DOS, released in 1990, significantly changed the user interface, with popup menus and dialog boxes. Even in graphics mode, these Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements got the monospace ASCII art look and feel found in text mode programs like Microsoft QuickBasic.\n\nWord 6.0 for DOS, the last Word for DOS version, was released in 1993, at the same time as Word 6.0 for Windows (16 bits) and Word 6.0 for Macintosh. Although Macintosh and Windows versions shared the same code base, the Word for DOS was different. The Word 6.0 for DOS macro language was compatible with the Word 3.x-5.x macro language while Word 6.0 for Windows and Word 6.0 for Macintosh inherited WordBasic from the Word 1.0/2.0 for Windows code base.

Supporters of Pyramid claimed that it would have been faster, smaller, and more stable than the product that was eventually released for Macintosh, and which was compiled using a beta version of Visual C++ 2.0 that targets the Macintosh, so many optimizations have to be turned off (the version 4.2.1 of Office is compiled using the final version), and sometimes use the Windows API simulation library included.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx |title=Buggin' My Life Away: Mac Word 6.0 |access-date=2009-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040514091238/http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx |archive-date=2004-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pyramid would have been truly cross-platform, with machine-independent application code and a small mediation layer between the application and the [[operating system]].\n\nMore recent versions of Word for Macintosh are no longer ported versions of Word for Windows.\n\nLater versions of Word have more capabilities than merely word processing. The drawing tool allows simple [[desktop publishing]] operations, such as adding graphics to documents.\n\n==Microsoft Office==\n\n===Word 95===\n\nWord 95 was released as part of Office 95 and was numbered 7.0, consistently with all Office components. It ran exclusively on the Win32 platform, but otherwise had few new features. The file format did not change.\n\n===Word 97===\n\nWord 97 had the same general operating performance as later versions such as Word 2000. This was the first copy of Word featuring the [[Office Assistant]], \"Clippit\", which was an animated helper used in all Office programs. This was a takeover from the earlier launched concept in [[Microsoft Bob]]. Word 97 introduced the macro programming language [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) which remains in use in Word 2016.\n\n===Word 98===\n\nWord 98 for the Macintosh gained many features of Word 97, and was bundled with the Macintosh Office 98 package. Document compatibility reached parity with Office 97 and Word on the Mac became a viable business alternative to its Windows counterpart. Unfortunately, Word on the Mac in this and later releases also became vulnerable to future macro viruses that could compromise Word (and Excel) documents, leading to the only situation where viruses could be cross-platform. A Windows version of this was only bundled with the Japanese/Korean Microsoft Office 97 Powered By Word 98 and could not be purchased separately. It was then released in the same period as well.\n\n===Word 2000===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2000}}\n\n===Word 2001/Word X===\n\nWord 2001 was bundled with the Macintosh Office for that platform, acquiring most, if not all, of the feature set of Word 2000. Released in October 2000, Word 2001 was also sold as an individual product. The Macintosh version, Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on (and required) [[Mac OS X]].\n\n===Word 2002/XP===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office XP}}\nWord 2002 was bundled with Office XP and was released in 2001. It had many of the same features as Word 2000, but had a major new feature called the 'Task Panes', which gave quicker information and control to a lot of features that were before only available in modal dialog boxes. One of the key advertising strategies for the software was the removal of the Office Assistant in favor of a new help system, although it was simply disabled by default.\n\n===Word 2003===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2003}}\nMicrosoft Office 2003 is an office suite developed and distributed by Microsoft for its Windows operating system. Office 2003 was released to manufacturing on August 19, 2003, and was later released to retail on October 21, 2003. It was the successor to Office XP and the predecessor to Office 2007.\n\n===Word 2004===\n\nA new Macintosh version of Office was released in May 2004. Substantial cleanup of the various applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and feature parity with Office 2003 (for [[Microsoft Windows]]) created a very usable release. Microsoft released patches through the years to eliminate most known macro vulnerabilities from this version. While Apple released Pages and the open source community created NeoOffice, Word remains the most widely used word processor on the Macintosh. Office 2004 for Mac is a version of Microsoft Office developed for Mac OS X. It is equivalent to Office 2003 for Windows. The software was originally written for PowerPC Macs, so Macs with Intel CPUs must run the program under Mac OS X's Rosetta emulation layer.\nAlso: Stable release: v11.6.6 / December 13, 2011; 7 years ago\n\n===Word 2007===\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2007}}\nThe release includes numerous changes, including a new XML-based file format, a redesigned interface, an integrated equation editor and [[bibliographic]] management. Additionally, an XML data bag was introduced, accessible via the object model and file format, called Custom XML \u2013 this can be used in conjunction with a new feature called Content Controls to implement structured documents. It also has contextual tabs, which are functionality specific only to the object with focus, and many other features like Live Preview (which enables you to view the document without making any permanent changes), Mini Toolbar, Super-tooltips, Quick Access toolbar, SmartArt, etc.\n\nWord 2007 uses a new file format called docx. Word 2000\u20132003 users on Windows systems can install a free add-on called the \"Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack\" to be able to open, edit, and save the new Word 2007 files.<ref>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&displaylang=en Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats</ref> Alternatively, Word 2007 can save to the old doc format of Word 97\u20132003.<ref>https://archive.is/20120715033535/http://techrepublic.com.com/5208-6230-0.html?forumID=102&threadID=218738&messageID=2212198 How to save as doc in Word 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walterglenn.com/2007/01/13/save-as-doc-instead-of-docx-in-word-2007/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324130734/http://www.walterglenn.com/2007/01/13/save-as-doc-instead-of-docx-in-word-2007/ |archivedate=2010-03-24 }} How to configure Word 2007 to always save as doc</ref>\n\n===Word 2008===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac}}\nWord 2008 was released on January 15, 2008. It includes some new features from Word 2007, such as a ribbon-like feature that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. Word 2008 also features native support for the new Office Open XML format, although the old doc format can be set as a default.<ref>The default format can be changed under preferences \u2192 save \u2192 dropdown menu [http://www.ehmac.ca/mac-ipod-help-troubleshooting/60852-changing-word-2008-default-format.html]</ref>\nMicrosoft Office 2008 for Mac is a version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite for Mac OS X. It supersedes Office 2004 for Mac and is the Mac OS X equivalent of Office 2007. Office 2008 was developed by Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit and released on January 15, 2008.\n\n===Word 2010===\nMicrosoft Office 2010 is a version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite for Microsoft Windows. Office 2010 was released to manufacturing on April 15, 2010, and was later made available for retail and online purchase on June 15, 2010. It is the successor to Office 2007 and the predecessor to Office 2013.\n{{See also|Microsoft Office 2010}}\n\n===Word 2011===\n\n{{See also|Microsoft Office for Mac 2011}}\n\n===Word 2013===\nThe release of Word 2013 has brought Word a cleaner look and this version focuses further on [[Cloud Computing]] with documents being saved automatically to [[OneDrive]] (previously Skydrive). If enabled, documents and settings roam with the user. Other notable features are a new read mode which allows for horizontal scrolling of pages in columns, a bookmark to find where the user left off reading their document and opening PDF documents in Word just like Word content. The version released for the [[Windows 8]] operating system is modified for use with a [[touchscreen]] and on tablets. It is the first version of Word to ''not'' run on [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]].<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624351.aspx Microsoft Technet System Requirements for Office 2013]</ref>\n\n=== Word 2016 ===\n{{see also|Microsoft Office 2016}}\nOn July 9, 2015, Microsoft Word 16 was released. Features include the tell me, share and faster shape formatting options. Other useful features include realtime collaboration, which allows users to store documents on Share Point or OneDrive, as well as an improved version history and a smart lookup tool. As usual, several editions of the program were released, including one for home and one for business.\n\n=== Word 2019 ===\n{{see also|Microsoft Office 2019}}\nWord 2019 added support for [[Scalable Vector Graphics]], [[Microsoft Translator]], and [[LaTeX]], as well as expanded drawing functionality.<ref>[https://helpdeskgeek.com/office-tips/whats-new-in-microsoft-office-2019/ What's New in Microsoft Office 2019 \u2014 HelpdeskGeek]</ref>\n\n=== Word included with Office 365 ===\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a free/paid subscription plan for the classic Office applications.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tsang, Cheryl.

It shows a wrestling match between two men who alternate ambiguous relations and gestures of aggression and erotic attraction.

Although not an overtly political piece, for many it raised questions about race, sexual attraction to men, and violence. It shows a wrestling match between two men who alternate ambiguous relations and gestures of aggression and erotic attraction. The film's protagonists, one of them McQueen, are both black, but issues of race, he has said, do not take priority in his work. Like all McQueen's early films, ''Bear'' is black-and-white, and was shot on [[16-millimetre film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-bear-t07073/text-summary |title='Bear', Steve McQueen |work=[[Tate Etc.]] |accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Five Easy Pieces'' (1995) is a short film by McQueen.

A man \u2013 played by McQueen \u2013 is shot in a way so as to crop out his body, but his head appears small at the bottom of the image, rising and falling with his step and coming in and out of frame according to the movement of the camera.

The first of McQueen's films to use sound was also the first to use multiple images: ''Drumroll'' (1998). This was made with three cameras, two mounted to the sides, and one to the front of an oil drum which McQueen rolled through the streets of [[Manhattan]]. The resulting films are projected on three walls of an enclosed space. McQueen has also made sculptures such as ''White Elephant'' (1998), as well as photographs.\n\nHe won the [[Turner Prize]] in 1999, although much of the publicity went to [[Tracey Emin]], who was also a nominee.<ref>{{cite news|title=McQueen wins Turner Prize|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/544210.stm|accessdate=17 October 2014|publisher=BBC|date=30 November 1999}}</ref> In 2006, he went to [[Iraq]] as an official war artist.

Trains to the West of Brighton operate on the [[West Coastway line]]. Together with the West Coastway and the [[Marshlink line]] to the east, the line forms part of a continuous route from [[Havant railway station|Havant]] to [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]]. The [[Brighton Main Line]] route to Eastbourne and Hastings, via {{Stnlnk|Plumpton}} and {{Stnlnk|Cooksbridge}}, shares the East Coastway line east of Lewes station.\n\nThe [[train operating company]] [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] refers to the routes on this line as \"East Coastway\" or \"Coastway East\".  The trains running under the East Coastway name serve stations between Brighton, [[Lewes]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Hastings]], [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]] and [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], together with the branch line to [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]]. A now-closed branch to [[Kemptown, Brighton]] diverged just east of [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road Station]].\n\n==Route==\n\n===Brighton to Lewes (East Branch)===\n<!--[[File:London Road Viaduct, Brighton, in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|London Road Viaduct in 1996]]-->\nFrom [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], trains using the East Coastway line use mostly the eastern platforms, travel along the [[Brighton Main Line]] before turning east over the 28 arch [[London Road viaduct]] giving views of the housing in Preston and Withdean in the north and the city to the south, before heading into a cutting where [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road (Brighton)]] is situated. The line climbs on a 1 in 258 gradient, through the first tunnel, Ditchling Road Tunnel, 63 yd (58m) in length. Shortly afterwards lay the junction for the [[Kemp Town branch line|Kemp Town branch]], closed in 1971. Continuing the climb the route passes {{Stnlnk|Moulsecoomb}}, opened 12 May 1980. Crossing Hodshrove Viaduct the gradient starts to increase to 1 in 99 reaching {{Stnlnk|Falmer}} on a 1 in 93 gradient, then levelling out in Falmer Tunnel, 490yd (441m).\nThe route now descends towards Lewes though the [[South Downs]] along a 1 in 88 gradient for around 4 miles, through the site of the former [[Lewes Priory]], then levelling out at {{Stnlnk|Lewes}}.\n\n===Keymer Junction to Lewes===\n<!--[[File:Cooksbridge Railway Station.jpg|thumb|right|Cooksbridge railway station]]-->\nLeaving the [[Brighton Main Line]] at Keymer Junction, just south of {{Stnlnk|Wivelsfield}}, the route turns south west passing through the northern edge of [[Burgess Hill]] and gently descending to {{Stnlnk|Plumpton}}. The line speed along this section of the line reaches 90&nbsp;mph still descending towards [[Cooksbridge railway station|Cooksbridge]] slowing to 70&nbsp;mph and passing [[Hamsey]] level crossing and turning south to run near the River Ouse and entering Lewes Tunnel, 395 yards and into {{Stnlnk|Lewes}}.\n\n===Lewes to Eastbourne===\n<!--[[File:Eastbournestation.jpg|thumb|right|Eastbourne railway station]]-->\nLewes has been the junction for other routes, two branch lines to the north: one for [[Eridge railway station|Eridge]] via [[Uckfield]]; the other to {{Stnlnk|East Grinstead}} and beyond. Both leaving Lewes via the [[Wealden Line]], splitting at Culver Junction. Leaving Lewes, the main line and the east branch converge and then sweep around a long curve over the River Ouse and under the [[A27 road]] to Southerham Junction for the [[Seaford Branch Line|Newhaven & Seaford branch]]. At one time, to the north side of the line lay [[Interchange station|interchange]] sidings for the then near-by cement works.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=plates 72 & 73 plus map}}\n\nA mile further the route passes under the [[A27 road]] again at the base of [[Mount Caburn]] then passing [[Glynde railway station|Glynde]] which once had interchange sidings for two [[Industrial railway|industrial branch]] lines; one to a [[clay]] pit and the other to a [[chalk]] pit. The line follows a near straight route to [[Berwick (Sussex) railway station|Berwick]], then heading on a slight undulating gradient over the [[River Cuckmere]] and then downhill towards the current [[Polegate railway station|Polegate station]] the previous station, 330 yards west, was once a busy junction station with the former branch line to {{Stnlnk|Eridge}} via {{Stnlnk|Hailsham}} ([[Cuckoo Line]]) which closed in 1968. The East Coastway line then continued west towards Hastings avoiding Eastbourne and a branch line heading southwest for Eastbourne. The direct line to Hastings is now closed, and all trains run into {{Stnlnk|Eastbourne}} and reverse to continue their journey. After a sharp bend the route follows a slight downhill gradient to Willingdon Junction, where the route to and from Hastings now runs. Shortly after is {{Stnlnk|Hampden Park}} then over the flat [[Willingdon Levels]] to {{Stnlnk|Eastbourne}}, a terminus station.\n\n===Eastbourne to St Leonards===\n<!--[[File:East Coastway Pevensey Levels.jpg|thumb|right|East Coastway line from Stone Cross (bottom) to Bexhill (top)]]-->\nFrom Eastbourne the route is reversed through Hampden Park to Willingdon Junction where the route turns west to the former Stone Cross Junction, where the route from Polegate once joined. Shortly after is the site of {{Stnlnk|Stone Cross Halt}}, opened in 1905 and closed 1935. Then a slight gradient to {{Stnlnk|Pevensey and Westham}} where the line now passes [[Pevensey Castle]] crosses the [[Pevensey Levels]] through the lesser served {{Stnlnk|Pevensey Bay}}, opened in 1905 as a halt and is now only served at peak times. Passing the [[Beachlands, Hampshire|Beachlands]] estate on the south and a caravan site the line passes through [[Normans Bay railway station|Normans Bay]]; this station was originally opened as a halt and still maintains an hourly service. Continuing along the Pevensey Levels the line passes close to the beach before heading inland at {{Stnlnk|Cooden Beach}} and [[Collington railway station|Collington]]; this station was originally opened as a halt in 1905, being named in turn Collington Wood Halt, West Bexhill Halt and Collington Halt, before reaching {{Stnlnk|Bexhill}}. The route next runs though a cutting to the site of Galley Hill sidings and then running along the coast past Bulverhythe and the depots of the [[Hastings Diesels]] and the [[South Eastern Trains|Southeastern]] and going through the site of [[St Leonards (West Marina) railway station|St Leonards (West Marina)]], closed 1967. The East Coastway line then ends shortly after at Bo-Peep Junction where the [[Hastings Line]] from Tonbridge continues through Bo-Peep Tunnel to [[St Leonards Warrior Square railway station|St Leonards (Warrior Square)]] and through Hastings Tunnel to {{Stnlnk|Hastings}}.\nSome trains from London and Brighton continue beyond Hastings to {{Stnlnk|Ore}} where there is a turnaround siding, the old depot having been closed and re-developed. This is the end of the East Coastway route. The line heading east to Ashford is the [[Marshlink line]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Main line===\nThe [[Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway]] (BLHR) was formed on 7 February 1844 and received Parliamentary approval for the construction of a line between Brighton and Lewes on 29 July 1844.{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=215}} Work was started by September, engineered by [[John Urpeth Rastrick]], with the route crossing a valley with the [[London Road viaduct]] then running through the South Downs to Falmer before descending to [[Lewes railway station|Lewes]], with a station at {{Stnlnk|Falmer}}.{{sfn|Carder|1990|p=144}}{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}} This section opened on 8 June 1846. On 27 June that year a single line extension was opened to just outside Hastings at {{Stnlnk|Bulverhythe}} with an intermediate station at {{Stnlnk|Polegate}} to serve [[Eastbourne]]{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}} (this section was later doubled in January 1849).\n\nOn 27 July 1846 the BLHR, along with other railways, merged to form the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]].{{sfn|McCarthy|McCarthy|2007|p=34}} In November 1846 the bridge over the [[River Asten]] was completed and Bulverhythe station was replaced with Hastings and St Leonards station, later renamed [[St Leonards West Marina railway station|St Leonards West Marina station]].{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=204}}{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=223}}\n\nFor almost a year all services from London travelled via Brighton until a spur off the [[Brighton main line]] was constructed from [[Keymer#Keymer Junction|Keymer Junction]] to Lewes and opened on 2 October 1847.{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=223}} On 14 May 1849, two branches from Polegate opened, one southwards to [[Eastbourne]] and one northwards to [[Hailsham]] making Polegate an important junction.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}}\n\nThe first station at Lewis was a terminus at Friars walk. After the extension to Hastings opened, through trains from Brighton visited the station then reversed out before continuing east. When the line from Haymer Junction opened on 1 October 1847, a new set of makeshift and unroofed platforms opened near the junction to the station, known as the Pinwell Platforms. These eliminated the need for reversing trains but were separate from Friars walk. A new junction station with four platform was constructed and opened on 1 November 1857, serving Brighton, London, Uckfield, Newhaven, Eastbourne and Hastings. To accommodate more platforms and reduce the tight curves, the station was rebuilt and re-aligned, and reopened on 17 June 1889. The original route leading to the freight yards was retained.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Lewes}}\n\nAnother junction station on the line was at {{Stnlnk|Polegate}}. In May 1849, two branch lines from Polegate were built, one southwards to Eastbourne and one north to Hailsham; both had left the station from the east which meant trains from Eastbourne had to reverse at Polegate. This was changed when the [[Cuckoo Line]] from Hailsham to Eridge was extended in 1880 and a new station was built 440 yards east and had four through platforms, the line to Hailsham was re-routed from the west of the station which eliminated the need to reverse trains from Eastbourne towards Tunbridge Wells.\n\n[[Eastbourne railway station|Eastbourne station]] was originally a timber building. It was rebuilt in 1866; the timber was reused to build a house at No.&nbsp;1 Wharf Road.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig. 104}} The second station was redesigned in 1872 and then significantly rebuilt in 1886.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig. 105}} At its peak it had four platforms, a locomotive shed and an extensive goods yard. A branch line was also built just north of the station heading east to the town's gas works and to the \"Crumbles\", an area of shingle which was once used for ballast on the railway line. The next station in the area was {{Stnlnk|Hampden Park}}, built in 1888 as Willingdon, after the parish of [[Willingdon, East Sussex|Willingdon]]. The junction north of Hampden Park is called Willingdon Junction, where the route diverges either east or west.\n\nA single line spur from Willingdon Junction to Stone Cross Junction was opened on 2 August 1871, forming a triangular junction between Polegate, Pevensey and Eastbourne and allowing direct trains to operate from Eastbourne to Hastings. This was doubled in 1862.\n\nThe remaining {{convert|0.25|mi}} of line to Hastings were constructed by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] in 1851 as a part of their line from [[Marshlink Line|Ashford to Hastings]] but the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] \u2013 obtained [[running powers]] over it.{{sfn|Course|1973|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Kemp Town branch===\nA {{convert|1.75|miles|adj=on}} long [[Kemp Town branch line|branch line]] from east of London Road station to {{rws|Kemp Town}} opened on 2 August 1869. It was expensive to build and required two arches at Lewes Road and Hartingon Road, and primarily constructed to alleviate the LBSCR's fears of another company approaching Brighton from the east.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=The Kemp Town Branch : Fig. 24 and Historical Background}} An intermediate station at {{rws|Lewes Road}} opened on 1 September 1873.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig.26 }}\n\nThe branch temporarily closed to passengers on 1 January 1917. It reopened on 10 August 1919 but closed permanently on 1 January 1933. During the Second World War, the tunnel leading into Brighton Kemptown was used as an air-raid shelter. The line continued to be used for goods traffic until 14 August 1971.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=The Kemp Town Branch : Historical Background}}\n\n===Crumbles branch===\nThis three-mile branch, constructed in 1862, led to a \u00be-mile-wide shingle bank known locally as The Crumbles. The [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|LB&SCR]] used the shingle as ballast for its railway lines.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 27}} Ballast trains ran until 1932 when the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] favoured granite. Other branches appeared on the line; a siding was built in 1870 when the Eastbourne Gas Company built their works which straddled the line. Coal was transported to the gas works. In return it produced coke and was taken away{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 32}} and in 1926 a line was created for the Eastbourne Corporation Electric Works to transport coal, also supplying fuel to the bus garage and taking scrap metal away from the refuse destructor works.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 29}} The branch saw its last steam engines in April 1960 and diesel shunting locomotives were provided for the work{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 28}} until the line closed in early 1967.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 29}}\n\n===Motor trains===\nIn 1905, the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway|LB&SCR]] introduced motor trains and unmanned halts between Eastbourne and St Leonards West Marina and new halts were built at {{stnlnk|Stone Cross Halt}}, {{Stnlnk|Pevensey Bay}}, {{Stnlnk|Normans Bay}}, {{Stnlnk|Cooden Beach}}, {{Stnlnk|Collington}} and {{stnlnk|Glyne Gap Halt}}.

Between {{Stnlnk|Hastings}} and [[St Leonards West Marina railway station|St Leonards West Marina]] the track is shared with [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] using their services on the [[Hastings Line]] and also shunting movements to the depot at St Leonards West Marina.\n\nA typical Southern service along the route is:\n* Hourly, London Victoria \u2013 Eastbourne\n* Hourly, London Victoria \u2013 Ore via Eastbourne\n* Hourly, Eastbourne \u2013 Ashford International\n* Hourly, Brighton \u2013 Hastings via Eastbourne\n* Hourly, Brighton \u2013 Ore via Eastbourne\n* Half hourly, Brighton \u2013 Seaford\n* Half hourly, Brighton \u2013 Lewes\n\nIn circumstances when the [[Brighton Main Line]] has both running lines closed between Preston Park and Keymer Junction, some services between Brighton and London may be diverted via Lewes, with trains having to reverse at the end of the station.\n\nA Southeastern service is typically a half hourly London Charing Cross\u2013Hastings.\n\n===Signalling===\n\n====Pre 2015====\nThe line was originally signalled by a mixture of [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore signals]] and [[British railway signals#Colour light signal aspects|colour lights]] by several signal boxes over the years. Almost every station had a signal box, Lewes even had five signal boxes controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three signal boxes and other signal boxes at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.\n\nBefore 2015, Three Bridges signalling centre controlled the route between Keymer Junction and Plumpton and Brighton to Falmer where Lewes Power Box takes over until Southerham Junction, from which [[British absolute block signalling|absolute block signalling]] takes over through to Hastings. Signal boxes were situated at Berwick, Polegate Crossing, Hampden Park, Eastbourne, Pevensey and Westham, Bexhill and Bo-Peep Junction. There were two crossing boxes at Plumpton and Normans Bay.\n\n====2015 Re-signalling====\nIn 2013 a project by Network Rail drew plans to upgrade the route between Lewes and St Leonards to replace the semaphore signals and signal boxes to colour light signals which will be controlled from a new Railway Operations Centre at Three Bridges.\nOn  Friday 13 February 2015, Berwick, Polegate, Hampden Park, Eastbourne, Pevensey and Westham, Normans Bay and Bexhill signal boxes signalled their last trains and over the weekend, the semaphore signals and current colour light signalling was replaced and new colour light signals installed and tested. The line reopened on Monday 16 February 2015 with Hampden Park Signal Box being demolished over the weekend. Bexhill, Eastbourne and Berwick signal boxes are listed buildings and were saved from demolition, and Polegate signal box was bought by the local town council to serve as a museum. Pevensey Signal box is due for demolition at a later date.\n\n==Accidents==\n{{See also|List of rail accidents in the United Kingdom}}\n* [[Eastbourne station rail crash]] \u2013 25 August 1958; 5 killed, 40 injured.\n* Bo-Peep Junction accident \u2013 23 June 1861; 10 injured<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=2500| title=Accident at Bo Peep Junction on 23 June 1861| accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref>\n* Falmer station accident \u2013 6 June 1851; 5 killed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BoT_Falmer1851.pdf| title=Board of Trade \u2013 Railway department accident report, L.B&S.C.R., 16 June 1851| accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:London Road Viaduct.jpg|The last slam door train over the London Road Viaduct in November 2005\nImage:LewesStation Big.jpg|Lewes railway station on 15 July 2003 \u2013 looking east\nImage:Hampden park junction signals.jpg|Semaphore signals at Willingdon Junction before resignalling\nImage:River Asten Railway Bridge.jpg|River Asten bridge, which delayed the building for six months\nImage:Bulverhithe Cleaning Depot.jpg|St Leonards depot at [[Bulverhythe]], possibly near the site of Bulverhythe station\nImage:Hastings & St Leonards RJD 100 - excerpt.jpg|A 1914 [[Railway Clearing House]] map of the eastern end of the East Coastway Line\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{butt-stations}}\n* {{cite book |last=Carder |first=Timothy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Brighton |year=1990 |chapter=Railways \u2013 East Coastway |publisher=East Sussex County Libraries |location=Lewes |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book| last=Course| first=Edwin| title=The Railways of Southern England: the Main Lines| year=1973| publisher=B.

Trains to the West of Brighton operate on the [[West Coastway line]]. Together with the West Coastway and the [[Marshlink line]] to the east, the line forms part of a continuous route from [[Havant railway station|Havant]] to [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]]. The [[Brighton Main Line]] route to Eastbourne and Hastings, via {{Stnlnk|Plumpton}} and {{Stnlnk|Cooksbridge}}, shares the East Coastway line east of Lewes station.\n\nThe [[train operating company]] [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] refers to the routes on this line as \"East Coastway\" or \"Coastway East\".  The trains running under the East Coastway name serve stations between Brighton, [[Lewes]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Hastings]], [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]] and [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], together with the branch line to [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]]. A now-closed branch to [[Kemptown, Brighton]] diverged just east of [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road Station]].\n \n==Route==\n\n===Brighton to Lewes (East Branch)===\n<!--[[File:London Road Viaduct, Brighton, in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|London Road Viaduct in 1996]]-->\nFrom [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], trains using the East Coastway line use mostly the eastern platforms, travel along the [[Brighton Main Line]] before turning east over the 28 arch [[London Road viaduct]] giving views of the housing in Preston and Withdean in the north and the city to the south, before heading into a cutting where [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road (Brighton)]] is situated. The line climbs on a 1 in 258 gradient, through the first tunnel, Ditchling Road Tunnel, 63 yd (58m) in length. Shortly afterwards lay the junction for the [[Kemp Town branch line|Kemp Town branch]], closed in 1971. Continuing the climb the route passes {{Stnlnk|Moulsecoomb}}, opened 12 May 1980. Crossing Hodshrove Viaduct the gradient starts to increase to 1 in 99 reaching {{Stnlnk|Falmer}} on a 1 in 93 gradient, then levelling out in Falmer Tunnel, 490yd (441m).\nThe route now descends towards Lewes though the [[South Downs]] along a 1 in 88 gradient for around 4 miles, through the site of the former [[Lewes Priory]], then levelling out at {{Stnlnk|Lewes}}.\n\n===Keymer Junction to Lewes===\n<!--[[File:Cooksbridge Railway Station.jpg|thumb|right|Cooksbridge railway station]]-->\nLeaving the [[Brighton Main Line]] at Keymer Junction, just south of {{Stnlnk|Wivelsfield}}, the route turns south west passing through the northern edge of [[Burgess Hill]] and gently descending to {{Stnlnk|Plumpton}}. The line speed along this section of the line reaches 90&nbsp;mph still descending towards [[Cooksbridge railway station|Cooksbridge]] slowing to 70&nbsp;mph and passing [[Hamsey]] level crossing and turning south to run near the River Ouse and entering Lewes Tunnel, 395 yards and into {{Stnlnk|Lewes}}.\n\n===Lewes to Eastbourne===\n<!--[[File:Eastbournestation.jpg|thumb|right|Eastbourne railway station]]-->\nLewes has been the junction for other routes, two branch lines to the north: one for [[Eridge railway station|Eridge]] via [[Uckfield]]; the other to {{Stnlnk|East Grinstead}} and beyond. Both leaving Lewes via the [[Wealden Line]], splitting at Culver Junction. Leaving Lewes, the main line and the east branch converge and then sweep around a long curve over the River Ouse and under the [[A27 road]] to Southerham Junction for the [[Seaford Branch Line|Newhaven & Seaford branch]]. At one time, to the north side of the line lay [[Interchange station|interchange]] sidings for the then near-by cement works.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=plates 72 & 73 plus map}}\n\nA mile further the route passes under the [[A27 road]] again at the base of [[Mount Caburn]] then passing [[Glynde railway station|Glynde]] which once had interchange sidings for two [[Industrial railway|industrial branch]] lines; one to a [[clay]] pit and the other to a [[chalk]] pit. The line follows a near straight route to [[Berwick (Sussex) railway station|Berwick]], then heading on a slight undulating gradient over the [[River Cuckmere]] and then downhill towards the current [[Polegate railway station|Polegate station]] the previous station, 330 yards west, was once a busy junction station with the former branch line to {{Stnlnk|Eridge}} via {{Stnlnk|Hailsham}} ([[Cuckoo Line]]) which closed in 1968. The East Coastway line then continued west towards Hastings avoiding Eastbourne and a branch line heading southwest for Eastbourne. The direct line to Hastings is now closed, and all trains run into {{Stnlnk|Eastbourne}} and reverse to continue their journey. After a sharp bend the route follows a slight downhill gradient to Willingdon Junction, where the route to and from Hastings now runs. Shortly after is {{Stnlnk|Hampden Park}} then over the flat [[Willingdon Levels]] to {{Stnlnk|Eastbourne}}, a terminus station.\n\n===Eastbourne to St Leonards===\n<!--[[File:East Coastway Pevensey Levels.jpg|thumb|right|East Coastway line from Stone Cross (bottom) to Bexhill (top)]]-->\nFrom Eastbourne the route is reversed through Hampden Park to Willingdon Junction where the route turns west to the former Stone Cross Junction, where the route from Polegate once joined. Shortly after is the site of {{Stnlnk|Stone Cross Halt}}, opened in 1905 and closed 1935. Then a slight gradient to {{Stnlnk|Pevensey and Westham}} where the line now passes [[Pevensey Castle]] crosses the [[Pevensey Levels]] through the lesser served {{Stnlnk|Pevensey Bay}}, opened in 1905 as a halt and is now only served at peak times. Passing the [[Beachlands, Hampshire|Beachlands]] estate on the south and a caravan site the line passes though [[Normans Bay railway station|Normans Bay]]; this station was originally opened as a halt and still maintains an hourly service. Continuing along the Pevensey Levels the line passes close to the beach before heading inland at {{Stnlnk|Cooden Beach}} and [[Collington railway station|Collington]]; this station was originally opened as a halt in 1905, being named in turn Collington Wood Halt, West Bexhill Halt and Collington Halt, before reaching {{Stnlnk|Bexhill}}. The route next runs though a cutting to the site of Galley Hill sidings and then running along the coast past Bulverhythe and the depots of the [[Hastings Diesels]] and the [[South Eastern Trains|Southeastern]] and going through the site of [[St Leonards (West Marina) railway station|St Leonards (West Marina)]], closed 1967. The East Coastway line then ends shortly after at Bo-Peep Junction where the [[Hastings Line]] from Tonbridge continues through Bo-Peep Tunnel to [[St Leonards Warrior Square railway station|St Leonards (Warrior Square)]] and through Hastings Tunnel to {{Stnlnk|Hastings}}.\nSome trains from London and Brighton continue beyond Hastings to {{Stnlnk|Ore}} where there is a turnaround siding, the old depot having been closed and re-developed. This is the end of the East Coastway route. The line heading east to Ashford is the [[Marshlink line]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Main line===\nThe [[Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway]] (BLHR) was formed on 7 February 1844 and received Parliamentary approval for the construction of a line between Brighton and Lewes on 29 July 1844.{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=215}} Work was started by September, engineered by [[John Urpeth Rastrick]], with the route crossing a valley with the [[London Road viaduct]] then running through the South Downs to Falmer before descending to [[Lewes railway station|Lewes]], with a station at {{Stnlnk|Falmer}}.{{sfn|Carder|1990|p=144}}{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}} This section opened on 8 June 1846. On 27 June that year a single line extension was opened to just outside Hastings at {{Stnlnk|Bulverhythe}} with an intermediate station at {{Stnlnk|Polegate}} to serve [[Eastbourne]]{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}} (this section was later doubled in January 1849).\n\nOn 27 July 1846 the BLHR, along with other railways, merged to form the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]].{{sfn|McCarthy|McCarthy|2007|p=34}} In November 1846 the bridge over the [[River Asten]] was completed and Bulverhythe station was replaced with Hastings and St Leonards station, later renamed [[St Leonards West Marina railway station|St Leonards West Marina station]].{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=204}}{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=223}}\n\nFor almost a year all services from London travelled via Brighton until a spur off the [[Brighton main line]] was constructed from [[Keymer#Keymer Junction|Keymer Junction]] to Lewes and opened on 2 October 1847.{{sfn|Turner|1977|p=223}} On 14 May 1849, two branches from Polegate opened, one southwards to [[Eastbourne]] and one northwards to [[Hailsham]] making Polegate an important junction.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Historical Background}}\n\nThe first station at Lewis was a terminus at Friars walk. After the extension to Hastings opened, through trains from Brighton visited the station then reversed out before continuing east. When the line from Haymer Junction opened on 1 October 1847, a new set of makeshift and unroofed platforms opened near the junction to the station, known as the Pinwell Platforms. These eliminated the need for reversing trains but were separate from Friars walk. A new junction station with four platform was constructed and opened on 1 November 1857, serving Brighton, London, Uckfield, Newhaven, Eastbourne and Hastings. To accommodate more platforms and reduce the tight curves, the station was rebuilt and re-aligned, and reopened on 17 June 1889. The original route leading to the freight yards was retained.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Lewes}}\n\nAnother junction station on the line was at {{Stnlnk|Polegate}}. In May 1849, two branch lines from Polegate were built, one southwards to Eastbourne and one north to Hailsham; both had left the station from the east which meant trains from Eastbourne had to reverse at Polegate. This was changed when the [[Cuckoo Line]] from Hailsham to Eridge was extended in 1880 and a new station was built 440 yards east and had four through platforms, the line to Hailsham was re-routed from the west of the station which eliminated the need to reverse trains from Eastbourne towards Tunbridge Wells.\n\n[[Eastbourne railway station|Eastbourne station]] was originally a timber building. It was rebuilt in 1866; the timber was reused to build a house at No.&nbsp;1 Wharf Road.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig. 104}} The second station was redesigned in 1872 and then significantly rebuilt in 1886.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig. 105}} At its peak it had four platforms, a locomotive shed and an extensive goods yard. A branch line was also built just north of the station heading east to the town's gas works and to the \"Crumbles\", an area of shingle which was once used for ballast on the railway line. The next station in the area was {{Stnlnk|Hampden Park}}, built in 1888 as Willingdon, after the parish of [[Willingdon, East Sussex|Willingdon]]. The junction north of Hampden Park is called Willingdon Junction, where the route diverges either east or west.\n\nA single line spur from Willingdon Junction to Stone Cross Junction was opened on 2 August 1871, forming a triangular junction between Polegate, Pevensey and Eastbourne and allowing direct trains to operate from Eastbourne to Hastings. This was doubled in 1862.\n\nThe remaining {{convert|0.25|mi}} of line to Hastings were constructed by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] in 1851 as a part of their line from [[Marshlink Line|Ashford to Hastings]] but the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] \u2013 obtained [[running powers]] over it.{{sfn|Course|1973|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Kemp Town branch===\nA {{convert|1.75|miles|adj=on}} long [[Kemp Town branch line|branch line]] from east of London Road station to {{rws|Kemp Town}} opened on 2 August 1869. It was expensive to build and required two arches at Lewes Road and Hartingon Road, and primarily constructed to alleviate the LBSCR's fears of another company approaching Brighton from the east.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=The Kemp Town Branch : Fig. 24 and Historical Background}} An intermediate station at {{rws|Lewes Road}} opened on 1 September 1873.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=Fig.26 }}\n\nThe branch temporarily closed to passengers on 1 January 1917. It reopened on 10 August 1919 but closed permanently on 1 January 1933. During the Second World War, the tunnel leading into Brighton Kemptown was used as an air-raid shelter. The line continued to be used for goods traffic until 14 August 1971.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1985|loc=The Kemp Town Branch : Historical Background}}\n\n===Crumbles branch===\nThis three-mile branch, constructed in 1862, led to a \u00be-mile-wide shingle bank known locally as The Crumbles. The [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|LB&SCR]] used the shingle as ballast for its railway lines.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 27}} Ballast trains ran until 1932 when the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] favoured granite. Other branches appeared on the line; a siding was built in 1870 when the Eastbourne Gas Company built their works which straddled the line. Coal was transported to the gas works. In return it produced coke and was taken away{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 32}} and in 1926 a line was created for the Eastbourne Corporation Electric Works to transport coal, also supplying fuel to the bus garage and taking scrap metal away from the refuse destructor works.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 29}} The branch saw its last steam engines in April 1960 and diesel shunting locomotives were provided for the work{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 28}} until the line closed in early 1967.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|1986|loc=plate 29}}\n\n===Motor trains===\nIn 1905, the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway|LB&SCR]] introduced motor trains and unmanned halts between Eastbourne and St Leonards West Marina and new halts were built at {{stnlnk|Stone Cross Halt}}, {{Stnlnk|Pevensey Bay}}, {{Stnlnk|Normans Bay}}, {{Stnlnk|Cooden Beach}}, {{Stnlnk|Collington}} and {{stnlnk|Glyne Gap Halt}}.

Almost every station had a signal box, Lewes even had five signal boxes controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three signal boxes and other signal boxes at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.\n\nBefore 2015, Three Bridges signalling centre controlled the route between Keymer Junction and Plumpton and Brighton to Falmer where Lewes Power Box takes over until Southerham Junction, from which [[British absolute block signalling|absolute block signalling]] takes over through to Hastings. Signal boxes were situated at Berwick, Polegate Crossing, Hampden Park, Eastbourne, Pevensey and Westham, Bexhill and Bo-Peep Junction. There were two crossing boxes at Plumpton and Normans Bay.\n\n====2015 Re-signalling====\nIn 2013 a project by Network Rail drew plans to upgrade the route between Lewes and St Leonards to replace the semaphore signals and signal boxes to colour light signals which will be controlled from a new Railway Operations Centre at Three Bridges.\nOn  Friday 13 February 2015, Berwick, Polegate, Hampden Park, Eastbourne, Pevensey and Westham, Normans Bay and Bexhill signal boxes signalled their last trains and over the weekend, the semaphore signals and current colour light signalling was replaced and new colour light signals installed and tested.
