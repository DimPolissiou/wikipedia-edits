It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were active-duty military personnel, and all made flights into space.\n\nThe [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) was a semi-secret [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) space project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission. Seventeen astronauts were selected for the program in three intakes in 1965, 1966 and 1967. They were drawn from the USAF, US Navy and US Marine Corps, but all were graduates of the USAF [[Aerospace Research Pilot School]]. The MOL program intended to use a modified NASA [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft known as [[Gemini B]].\n\nWhen the MOL program was canceled in June 1969, fourteen astronauts remained in the program. NASA accepted the seven youngest as NASA astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but they were given non-flying support assignments for Apollo, [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. The former MOL astronauts went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a [[delta-wing]] glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). Its [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|53800000|1958|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to NASA that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest, but not Dyna-Soar.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the Cold War, and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. In 1961 the new [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar skip the suborbital missions and be launched into orbit.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nOn 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL). A Dyna-Soar pilot, Albert H. Crews, was transferred to the MOL program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara canceled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft that became known as [[Gemini B]] instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}} President [[Lyndon Johnson]] issued an official announcement of his approval of the MOL Program at a press conference on August 25, 1965.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}}<ref>{{cite press release |title=President Johnson's Statement on MOL |date=25 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/129.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The MOL Program became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]] spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nThe MOL program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B.

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected. The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN\n* Captain [[C.

One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A.

The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69\u201372}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had increased significantly. Originally estimated at $1.5 billion in 1965 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1500000000|1965|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}), the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 the MOL program was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. The program encountered delays in developing surveillance technology, and funding cuts delayed it further, pushing the date for the first manned flight back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76\u201379}} On June 10, 1969, the MOL Project was canceled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}}\n\nAt this point, fourteen of the seventeen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} Finlay had returned to the US Navy in April 1968,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=230}} and Adams had left in July 1966 to join the X-15 Program.

They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. He told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]], NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although as a test pilot rather than an astronaut. He would continue flying NASA aircraft until 1994. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 14, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91\u201392}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Years Ago: NASA Group 7 Astronaut Selection  |publisher= NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-nasa-group-7-astronaut-selection |access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Group members ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Refs\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n| scope=\"row\"  data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

The first step was selection to a mission support crew. Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, Hartsfield and Peterson on that of Apollo 16, and Overmyer on that of Apollo 17, and they performed CAPCOM duties on those missions. Fullerton was also CAPCOM on Apollo 15 and 16.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270\u2013271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304\u2013305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on that of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308\u2013309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of Astronaut Group 5 who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all members of the group had flown. Although they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, was the only one conducted by a member of the group. All the others would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as the mission commander, before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324\u2013331}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Berger |first=Carl |contribution=A History of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program Office |editor-last=Outzen |editor-first=James D. |title=The Dorian Files Revealed: The Secret Manned Orbiting Laboratory Documents Compendium  |publisher=Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance |location=Chantilly, Virginia |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-937219-18-5 |oclc=966293037 |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/history/csnr/programs/docs/MOL_Compendium_August_2015.pdf |access-date=4 April 2020 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |location=Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.

It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were active-duty military personnel, and all made flights into space.\n\nThe [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) was a semi-secret [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) space project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission. Seventeen astronauts were selected for the program in three intakes in 1965, 1966 and 1967. They were drawn from the USAF, US Navy and US Marine Corps, but all were graduates of the USAF [[Aerospace Research Pilot School]]. The MOL program intended to use a modified NASA [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft known as [[Gemini B]].\n\nWhen the MOL program was canceled in June 1969, fourteen astronauts remained in the program. NASA accepted the seven youngest as NASA astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but they were given non-flying support assignments for Apollo, [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. The former MOL astronauts went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a [[delta-wing]] glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). Its [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|53800000|1958|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to NASA that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest, but not Dyna-Soar.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the Cold War, and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. In 1961 the new [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar skip the suborbital missions and be launched into orbit.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nOn 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL). A Dyna-Soar pilot, Albert H. Crews, was transferred to the MOL program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara canceled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft that became known as [[Gemini B]] instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}} President [[Lyndon Johnson]] issued an official announcement of his approval of the MOL Program at a press conference on August 25, 1965.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}}<ref>{{cite press release |title=President Johnson's Statement on MOL |date=25 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/129.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The MOL Program became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]] spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nThe MOL program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B.

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

Truly]], USN.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAround this time, the USAF began selecting a second group of MOL astronauts. This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected. The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN\n* Captain [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], USAF\n* Captain [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], USAF\n* Captain [[Robert F.

One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A.

The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69\u201372}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had increased significantly. Originally estimated at $1.5 billion in 1965 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1500000000|1965|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}), the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 the MOL program was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. The program encountered delays in developing surveillance technology, and funding cuts delayed it further, pushing the date for the first manned flight back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76\u201379}} On June 10, 1969, the MOL Project was canceled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}}\n\nAt this point, fourteen of the seventeen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} Finlay had returned to the US Navy in April 1968,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=230}} and Adams had left in July 1966 to join the X-15 Program.

They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. He told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]], NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although as a test pilot rather than an astronaut. He would continue flying NASA aircraft until 1994. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 14, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91\u201392}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Years Ago: NASA Group 7 Astronaut Selection  |publisher= NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-nasa-group-7-astronaut-selection |access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Group members ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Refs\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n| scope=\"row\"  data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

Left to right: Fullerton, Haise, Engle and Truly.]]\nIt was a long time before any of the seven MOL astronauts who transferred to NASA in 1969 would fly in space. The first step was selection to a mission support crew. Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, Hartsfield and Peterson on that of Apollo 16, and Overmyer on that of Apollo 17, and they performed CAPCOM duties on those missions. Fullerton was also CAPCOM on Apollo 15 and 16.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270\u2013271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304\u2013305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on that of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308\u2013309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of Astronaut Group 5 who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all members of the group had flown. Although they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, was the only one conducted by a member of the group. All the others would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as the mission commander, before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324\u2013331}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Berger |first=Carl |contribution=A History of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program Office |editor-last=Outzen |editor-first=James D. |title=The Dorian Files Revealed: The Secret Manned Orbiting Laboratory Documents Compendium  |publisher=Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance |location=Chantilly, Virginia |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-937219-18-5 |oclc=966293037 |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/history/csnr/programs/docs/MOL_Compendium_August_2015.pdf |access-date=4 April 2020 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |location=Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.

Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (before marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz start to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqi arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. When Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, he gets really angry.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (after marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Ahmad calls Nabeel to tell him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, which means that they have to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's [[father]] arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. He also finds a job for Nabeel; but Nabeel quits, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bulbulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes on a trip to [[Dubai]] but without telling each other.

While walking in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't know each other and rush back to their rooms. When both families have plans to go to the Oasis Mall, and both Mehmood and Nabeel are taking showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Mumtaz (Momo) wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other clearly. Momo goes out of the hotel to avoid Khoobsurat and rushes off to the mall in a taxi.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are offered jobs that don't work out.\n\n====Episode 88-100 (pre-parenthood)====\nWhile returning home from Dubai, Momo loses her bag at the airport.

Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz start to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well.

He identified them as Persian by the style and quality.]]\nGanjifa cards are circular or rectangular,<ref>A rectangular example dated to around 1770 is held in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France. See http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55007315w/f13.item</ref> and traditionally hand-painted by [[artisan]]s. The game became popular at the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court, and lavish sets were made, from materials such as precious stone-inlaid ivory or tortoise shell (''darbar kalam''). The game later spread to the general public, whereupon cheaper sets (''baz\u00e2r kalam'') would be made from materials such as [[wood]], [[palm tree|palm leaf]], stiffened cloth or pasteboard. Typically Ganjifa cards have coloured backgrounds, with each suit having a different colour. Different types exist, and the designs, number of suits, and physical size of the cards can vary considerably. With the exception of Mamluk Kanjifa and the Chads of Mysore, each suit contains ten [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] and two [[face card|court cards]], the king and the [[vizier]] or minister. The backs of the cards are typically a uniform colour, without patterning.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe earliest origins of the cards remain uncertain, but Ganjifa cards as they are known today are believed to have originated in [[Persia]]. The first syllable is attributed to the Persian word 'ganj' meaning treasure. Gen. [[Albert Houtum-Schindler|Houtum-Schindler]] suggested to [[Stewart Culin]] that the last two syllables in the word 'Ganjifa' may be derived from the Chinese chi-p'ai, meaning playing cards <ref>(Culin p928)</ref><ref>Andy Pollett covers this line of argument on http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards25.htm (retrieved 03/01/2015).</ref> In a related passage [[William Andrew Chatto|Chatto]] explains that an early Chinese term was 'ya-pae', meaning 'bone ticket', and that the term 'che-pae' came later, meaning literally 'paper ticket'(1848: 58). These different terms could account for the different spellings and pronunciations of 'Ganjifa'. Rolf Zimmermann goes further in his 2006 article, and suggests that the first syllable of the word Ganjifa could come from 'Han' as in [[Han Chinese]], and thus 'Ganjifa' would mean 'han-chi-pai', or '[[Chinese playing cards]]'.<ref>(Retrieved from Szent Istv\u00e1n t\u00e9r on 03/01/2015)</ref> These remain unproved theories, but the 18th century traveller [[Carsten Niebuhr]] claimed to have seen Arabian merchants in Bombay playing with Chinese cards.<ref>(Niebuhr 1774: 173)</ref> In the 19th century [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Jean Louis Burckhardt]] visited Mecca and wrote that 'cards are played in almost every Arab coffee-house (they use small Chinese cards)'.<ref>(Burckhardt 1829: 377)</ref>\n\nGanjifa became popular in [[India]] under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors in the 16th century. The term has been used at times in many countries throughout the Middle East and western Asia. In Kuwait, the word 'Janjifah' has become a general term and so is applied to the internationally known [[French playing cards|French deck]].<ref>In Arabic and Persian, there exists also the more general word for playing cards, 'waraq' ( \u0648\u0631\u0642 ). This word can be found in texts that may refer to Ganjifa cards. For example in the 16th century work, the Humayun-namah, about the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]], this term 'waraq' is used. The text describes a gambling game that was played during celebrations upon Humayun's return to [[Kabul]] in 1545. The game involved twelve players, each with twenty cards. Refer Beveridge (1902: 178, or 77 in the Persian section of the book).</ref>\n\n===Arabic sources and surviving cards===\n[[File:Mamluk kanjifah cards.png|thumb|320px|Four Mamluk playing cards]]\nDespite the significance of Persia in the history of ganjifa cards, the very earliest known text reference ([[Ibn Taghribirdi]]) and card specimens ([[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk era]]) are from Egypt.\n\nAn exhibition in the British museum in 2013 noted \"Playing cards are known in Egypt from the twelfth century AD. Ganjafeh was a popular card game in Iran and the Arab world.\" For example, the word 'kanjifah' ( \u0643\u0646\u062c\u0641\u0629 ) is written in the top right corner of the king of swords, on the Mamluk Egyptian deck witnessed by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer|L.A. Mayer]] in the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] museum. The Mamluk cards are difficult to date with any certainty, but Mayer estimated these cards to be from the 15th century.  The piece of playing card collected by [[Edmund de Unger]] may be from the period of the 12-14th centuries.<ref>(Mayer 1971: 9); See also the discussion on the [[Playing card#Early history|early history of playing cards]].</ref> The term Kanjifah can be found in the 1839 Calcutta edition of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]], in Arabic, at the end of night 460. The first known reference can be found in a 15th-century Arabic text, written by the Egyptian historian [[Ibn Taghribirdi]] (died 1470). In his history of Egypt he mentions how the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mu'ayyad played kanjafah for money when he was an emir.<ref>The text is described in English by [[Richard Ettinghausen]], in his article \"Further Comments on Mamluk Playing Cards\". The quote refers to the work of [[Ibn Taghribirdi]], called \"Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira\". Ettinghausen notes that the reference comes in the section describing events from the year 820H or 1417-1418 AD (1984: 1194). The original Arabic text can be found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=QCvC39URTY4C&lpg=PP1&dq=editions%3Ae0XIWB1KOVMC&pg=PT535 (Google E-book) or http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-11988/page-4536 .

(1895) [http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html Chinese Origin of Playing Cards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302040523/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html |date=2016-03-02 }}. The American Anthropologist, Volume VIII, pp. 61-78.</ref> He was unaware of the existence of the Mamluk cards since Mayer did not make his discovery until 1939. The similarities between the Latin European cards and Chinese money-suited cards become more apparent when the Mamluk Kanjifa is described. Looking at the actual games played with Ganjifa cards, Andrew Leibs points out that the cards are divided into strong and weak suits, and in one set the order of the numerical cards is reversed, so that the order runs King, Vizier, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the weakest. This feature can also be found in the old games of [[Tarot card games|Tarot]], [[Ombre]], and [[Spoil Five|Maw]] played in Europe, and the Chinese money-suited card game of '[[Madiao]]'. He suggests these games may have a common ancestor.<ref>(2004: 130)</ref>\n\nKanjifa consists of 52 cards divided into four suits:\n*'''Coins''': This suit is in reverse order like in Chinese money-suited card games of [[Madiao]] and [[Khanhoo]] as well as in Tarot, Ombre, and Maw. The high ranking cards of this suit have blue panels (king, viceroy, second viceroy, 1, 2, 3).<ref>Gjerde, Tor. [http://cards.old.no/1500-mamluk/ Mamluk cards, ca. 1500] at Historical playing cards.

This suit is also in reverse order as indicated by the blue panels. This suit was converted into cudgels (Spain) or batons (Italy) as polo was too obscure in Europe.\n*'''Cups''': The cups are called [[Tumen (unit)|tuman]], a Turkic, Mongol, and Jurchen word meaning \"[[myriad]]\". In China, there is a suit of myriads ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e07}}}}). Wilkinson proposed that European cups were created by flipping the Chinese character. In Italy and Spain, this suit was inverted but in the Mamluk deck the blue panels are only found in the three court cards.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pollett|first1=Andrea|title=Tuman, or the Ten Thousand Cups of the Mamluk Cards|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2002|volume=31|issue=1|pages=34\u201341}}</ref>\n*'''Swords''': This suit is in the logical order with blue panels on the king, viceroy, second viceroy, 10, 9, and 8.

Trade continued after the conquest of these regions by the Ottomon Turks in 1517. They were also mentioned by [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]]. The lack of references or cards after the 16th century is likely due to the Ottomans taking a harder stance against cards and gambling which would last until the 19th century.<ref name=\"Dummett\" />\n\n===Persian sources===\n[[File:Ganjifa p16 Researches into the history of playing cards.jpg|thumb|Images of cards from the collection of [[Francis Douce]], shown by [[Samuel Weller Singer]].

From travellers to Persia in the seventeenth century we know that a set of ganjifeh consisted of ninety or ninety-six cards in eight suits or colors.<ref>See for example [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] (1676: 626), and [[Jean Chardin]] (1811: 451).</ref>\n\n[[Michael Dummett]] noted the differences between Mamluk kanjifa and Safavid ganjifeh and postulated that there was an earlier ancestor. This ur-ganjifeh would be similar to kanjifa but with only two court cards, the king and the viceroy/vizier. The second viceroy rank found in the kanjifa pack is not based on any historical title and may be a Mamluk invention. According to his hypothesis, the Chinese money-suited pack entered Persia where the Persians added three new ranks: the 10, viceroy, and king to make a 48-card pack. He suggests the Persians eventually changed most of the Chinese suits to fit their culture while the Mamluks were more conservative with the suits. The addition of new suits in both Persia and India was to make the game more challenging as memory is the most important skill in the eponymous [[trick-taking game]].<ref name=\"Dummett\" /> Chinese money-suited cards copied their pips directly from Chinese banknotes. In 1294, [[Gaykhatu]] began printing an imitation of [[Jiaochao|Yuan banknotes]] in Iran although these were withdrawn quickly after merchants rejected them.<ref>[[Eliyahu Ashtor|Ashtor, Eliyahu]].

This decline has several aspects.\n\n* Improvements in printing techniques and machinery allowed manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere to improve their output and further expand their export of playing cards. Manufacturers introduced steam powered machines, [[lithography]] and later [[Offset printing]] during the 19th century. For example, the town of Turnhout in Belgium was a centre of playing cards manufacture. The Turnhout manufacturer Brepols installed steam powered equipment in 1852, lithographic printing of playing cards in 1862, and began offset printing in 1920.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, pages 23-25</ref> In the period around 1900 the French manufacturer Camoin<ref>See also French wikipedia article [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Camoin]]</ref> exported cards to North Africa, and the Middle East as far as the Persian Gulf.<ref>p81-2, Cartes \u00e0 jouer & tarots de Marseille: La donation Camoin</ref> The Indian market was so significant for the Belgian manufacturer 'Biermans' that a factory was established in Calcutta in 1934.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 27</ref> In 1938 playing card exports from the US to India totalled some 888,603 packs, and 60,344 packs were exported to Iraq.<ref>Bureau of the Census pages 642-3</ref> For the Ottoman Empire some European manufacturers produced cards with specific designs, known as 'cartes turques' and 'cartes orientales'. These were essentially 4-suited European style designs, but the aces featured scenic prints adapted to the target market.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 18, and on p.22 an example is shown from the Turnhout manufacturer Gl\u00e9nisson, from the second half of the 19th Century. The ace has a double-headed design, with a scene of the modern city of Istanbul on one end, and a scene of the historic city on the other, when it was called [[Constantinople]]. The titles are written using the Arabic alphabet.</ref>\n* Ganjifa cards were less suited to Western card games. The invention of games such as [[Euchre]], [[History of contract bridge|Bridge]], [[History of poker|Poker]], and [[Rummy]] can be seen as significant events and Western style playing cards are best suited to these games. In Iran, the game of As-Nas largely fell out of fashion by around 1945.<ref>Article from the Brooklyn Museum website, consulted 15/11/2014 \"As nas became popular under the Qajars and continued to be played until the end of World War II, when it lost favor to games such as poker, rummy, and bridge.\". Link: http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/169352/Playing_Cards_for_the_Game_of_Nas</ref> In some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, a version of the French game [[Belote]] became popular, under the name [[Baloot]] ( \u0628\u0644\u0648\u062a ). With regards to India, European style cards were introduced during the colonial period, with demand coming from the wealthier classes.<ref>Crestin Billet (2002:188)</ref> Some cards were imported, some were made by hand using traditional techniques, and others were made by Indian industrialists. The [[Cary Collection of Playing Cards]] (Yale University) has a deck of Indian-made bridge cards dated to around 1935, for example.<ref>Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Cary Playing Cards Database.

Title: ZENITH 515 BRIDGE PLAYING CARDS</ref>\n* Taxes on playing cards. States used taxes on playing cards to generate revenue, and required specific stamps or wrappers on packs of cards. Such arrangements can create barriers for smaller manufacturers producing cards by hand. The Ottoman Empire introduced taxes on playing cards in 1904.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 26</ref>\n* Playing cards monopolies. In many countries state monopolies were established to control imports and production. Such monopolies tend to standardise card designs, or create conditions that better suit larger manufacturers that can win government contracts or meet the necessary conditions. In Iran, the monopoly was set up following the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act of 1931. The British playing card manufacturer [[De La Rue]] was commissioned to provide cards during the 1930s. The cards featured indexing in [[Persian language|Persian]] and court card images that evoked Persian history. Nonetheless the cards used Western style suits, and so the commissioning of the cards reinforced the position of Western-style 4-suited printed cards.\n\nBy the 21st-century, the only place with a significant community of ganjifa makers and players is [[Odisha]] in the east of India. They use [[ganjapa]], the local variation known for abstract and highly stylized suit symbols and extra suits.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Ten Playing Cards (Ganjifa) LACMA M.2001.210.4.1-.10.jpg|thumb|Various Ganjifa cards from [[Dashavatara]] set]]\n* '''Moghul Ganjifa'''<ref>For more information and images refer to pattern sheet 67 of the International Playing Card Society (website: http://www.i-p-c-s.org).

Very few such cards are known or exist. The [[Playing card#Egypt|examples]] found by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer]] are understood to have four suits: cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks. Each suit has three court cards, the king (malik), the first vizir (na'ib malik), and the second vizir (na'ib thani). The court cards have no figurative imagery, but they feature calligraphed inscriptions and richly decorated backgrounds. The term 'Kanjifa' appears in Arabic on the king of swords. They directly inspired the Latin-suited playing cards of [[Italian playing cards|Italy]] and [[Spanish playing cards|Spain]].\n* '''French suited Ganjifa'''.

This is the game most commonly associated with ganjifa cards, each player playing for him or herself. The objective is to win the most cards by taking tricks. At least three players are required. In some games 4 players play individually, and it is also possible to play in pairs. The rules vary, but generally the following apply:\n\n:In the simplest form of the game there is no concept of a '[[trump (card games)|trump]] suit' that beats cards in other suits.<ref>A variant is possible where the 'lead suit' as described below is the trump suit.</ref> A trick can only be won by a card of the same suit. When a player is not in position to win a trick there is no obligation to [[follow suit|follow the suit]] led.\n\n:In all cases the King ('mir' or 'shah') is always the strongest card in each suit, followed by the Vizier. However, in half the suits the numerical cards rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and the other suits the order of the numerical cards is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.<ref>This feature of a reversed order in the number cards of half the suits can be found in some European games, notably [[Ombre]], [[Spoil Five|Maw]], and [[Tarot card games|most games]] played with [[Tarot]] cards. For the game of Ombre see the rules given by Peter Arnold, for example (2010:88), and Chatto points out this similarity between the rules of Ganjifa and those of Ombre (1848:45). An Italian account explains how this feature of Ombre also applied to the game played with the [[Minchiate]] tarot cards (Brunetti 1747:16)(direct link https://books.google.com/books?id=x_1dAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA16 ). The suits of cups (coppe) and coins (denari) are those with the reversed order of the number cards. In France this inverted order did feature for a time in the game of [[French tarot]], at least in some regions, although it has now disappeared from the modern standard rules. The book 'Tarot, Jeu et Magie' points to two literary sources that mention this feature, from the 18th and 19th centuries (1984:122-124)(link, text in French, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6532698n ).</ref> If playing with a Moghul type pack, the suits with the 'reverse order' numerical cards are barat, zar-e zorkh, qomash, and chang (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e saf\u012bd (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs the suits with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols).\n\n:Before the start of play stakes are agreed if the game is being played for money. At the end of the round the losing player pays this stake value, multiplied by the difference in number of tricks taken between the winner and the loser.\n\n====Dealing====\n:Players draw cards at the beginning to determine who will deal. Traditionally players would sit on a sheet or large cloth on the floor, and the cards are mixed face down in the middle of the cloth, rather than shuffled in the manner of Western cards.\n\n:The deal and the order of the play follows an anti-clockwise direction. The dealer deals out all the cards. According to custom cards may be dealt in batches of four, rather than individually. Some accounts stipulate that the first batch and last batch dealt to each player are dealt face up.<ref>These are the rules given by Shrikrisna Maudranalay, and also those in the account by Chatto (1848: 42)</ref>\n\n:Players should sort their cards into suits and put them in order. For convenience, due to the large number of cards, players often separate any low value pip cards and keep them to the side, keeping only the more valuable cards in hand. When discarding during play these low value cards are used indifferently.\n\n====Play====\n:During the game players must try to keep track of the cards that have been played. The highest outstanding cards left in play in each suit are called 'hukm', corresponding to the Persian word \" \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \".<ref>[[Court piece|Hukm (or Hokm)]] is the name of a card game played in modern Iran. It is of the same general family of games as the ganjifa trick taking game. Play is to the right (counterclockwise), cards are dealt in batches, and as in ganjifa, the player that leads the game is one that receives a high card (in the case of Hokm, an ace). Refer to http://www.pagat.com/whist/hokm.html</ref>\n\n:The player to lead is the one holding the King in a certain suit. This 'lead suit' varies according to the type of pack, and also according to whether the game is played during the day (between sunrise and sunset) or during the night. With a Moghul pack the lead suits are zar-e zorkh (red gold coins, or figuratively 'suns') by day, and zar-e safid (white gold coins or figuratively 'moons') by night. If playing with Dashavtar cards the lead suits are Rama by day, and Krishna by night. The player holding the King in this lead suit begins by playing two cards at once - the King and another low card. The other players cannot win, and so they each discard two low cards which are won by the player who led the game. This player then leads again. At this point accounts of the game rules differ. The rules below on gameplay are based on the description by John McLeod.<ref>Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997. The newsgroup can be browsed for example via google: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.games.playing-cards . Direct weblink to post, retrieved February 8, 2015: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rec.games.playing-cards/ganjifa/rec.games.playing-cards/m3h8xA9rLh4/5Im7ud3hQJYJ . For comparison, other accounts can be found, such as Sally Wilkins (2002: 194-195); the booklet given with sets of cards by Sawandwadi Lacquerwares, written by Maudranalay; Chatto (1848:41-43), who quotes from an article from the 'Calcutta Magazine' (1815); and an article by Kishor Gordhandas, retrieved on Feb. 8, 2015: http://kishorcards.tripod.com/08handed/handed1to6.htm</ref>\n\n:Rules govern which leads are possible. Players must lead as follows, in order of priority: 1) If the lead player has a continuous series of winning cards in a suit, then this sequence must be led, with the exception of the last card in the sequence which is kept for later. 2) The next possibility is a move called 'deni'. This is possible when a player lacks the hukm in a given suit, but has the second highest outstanding card. In this case the player may lead a low card in that suit, and call for the hukm. The opponent with the hukm then wins the trick but the player that made the 'deni' move retains the lead, which is the advantage of making this move. If the player with the hukm also holds the third highest card in the suit, he may play this card as well, and it is said that the deni is doubled. In this case everyone plays a second card and the player with the hukm wins two tricks. However the lead still returns to the player who made the deni move. 3) When a leader cannot make either of the two leads described above, he then leads out any remaining hukm cards, all at once, a move called 'utari'.<ref>Noted by Wilkins (2002: 195). Compare also the definition given by Maudranalay, page 16.</ref> In McLeod's account this is the only option available to a player at this stage, so a player would need to lead any hukms they might have, and then pass the lead as described next in step 4. However in the rules given by Wilkins there is a second option, whereby the player can instead simply lead a low card or non-winning card of his choosing to pass the lead.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\">Wilkins (2002:195)</ref> 4) If a player has no further valid options for leading cards, he gives up the lead by shuffling his hand, and placing the cards face down. The player to his right then selects the card that he must lead, for example by saying 'fourth from the top' or pointing to a card if they are spread out. The lead then passes to the player who wins the trick, who then follows the same sequence of possible leads as described above.\n\n:In some accounts there is an end phase or secondary phase to the game, in which the leading rules are simplified or changed. According to McLeod, when the players get down to the last 12 cards, steps 1 and 2 described above are skipped, and a player starts by leading out all his hukms directly. After doing so, the player must try to lead a card from a suit named by his right-hand neighbour. If he cannot lead this suit the lead is passed as described in step 4 above, with the player's cards shuffled and placed face down. In Wilkins' account, there is also a second phase to the game, which applies when all the players have held and lost the lead once. From this point onwards hukm cards are played individually instead of in batches. Furthermore, in this second phase, if a player leads a low card, it is played face down and the player can freely choose the suit which must be followed.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:The round continues until all the cards have been played. At this point the players can count their tricks and decide any payments or forfeits that must be paid. However in the rules described by Chatto there a final round played using the cards won in tricks. This is a challenging game called 'Ser-k'hel'. Players shuffle their tricks, and the winner of the last trick plays one trick blind against a player of his choice. The winner of this trick then challenges the player to his right in the same way.<ref>Chatto (1848:43)</ref>\n\n====Following rounds====\n:In some accounts losing players are disadvantaged when starting the next round. One possibility is that players are required to use the cards won in tricks for playing with in the following round. Players who are short on cards have to buy cards from other players to make up the difference.<ref>See Chatto (1848:43)</ref> Alternatively, cards can be shuffled and distributed equally, but losing players are required to exchange cards with winning players. The losing player must give cards at random, without looking at them, and the winning player is allowed to return low value cards, sorted from his hand. The number of cards exchanged is the difference in the number of tricks won in the last round.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:The total number of rounds played may vary. In Chatto's account a full game is made up of four rounds. In the version described by Maudranalay, there is no fixed number of rounds, rather the game must continue round after round until a losing player (presumably meaning a player who lost the previous round of gameplay) beats the card led by another player on the last trick of the round.<ref>Maudranalay, page 16.</ref> This last lead card is called the 'akheri', from a word for 'last' (which exists in persian and Arabic ( \u0622\u062e\u0631 ). In Wilkin's account, this event has a different significance. Wilkins writes that if a player beats the akheri card, he is exempted from paying any forfeit money going into the next round.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:An adaptation is possible if players use the international 52 card pack. In this case the game is for three players only, and the 2 of diamonds is removed so that players each receive 17 cards each. The lead suit is always spades. In an account about gameplay in northern India (before the creation of Pakistan), Shurreef writes that the King is referred to as 'Badshah' (corresponding to the Persian term 'Padishah'), the queen as 'Bibia' (Persian term 'Bibi'), and the Jack as the 'Ghulam', meaning 'slave'.<ref>Shurreef (1999:336).</ref>\n\n===Partnership Ganjifa===\nPlayed in partnerships (two against two). Some call this game 'Dugi'.<ref>See IPCS paper 'Ganjifa - the traditional playing cards of India', by Jeff Hopewell, p63. The name 'Dugi' is used in Digapahandi (Orissa)</ref> In this game the order of the suits and the cards is the same as for the individual ganjifa trick taking game described above, however the aim of the game is for one partnership to win all the tricks. The partnership dealt the King in the lead suit has to take on this challenge. It is possible to determine the lead suit by the day or night rule as above, or by cutting cards. The following game rules are taken from an account by John McLeod<ref>Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997. The newsgroup can be browsed for example via google: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.games.playing-cards .

Before starting, the lead king can be passed from one partner to another in exchange for another card of the same suit.\n\n:When leading, a player must lead all the 'hukms' that they have in hand (these are the highest cards remaining in a given suit, that are sure to win). Players must follow suit if they are able to do so. If this is not possible, the leading player names another suit, and they must discard their highest card in that suit. If they do not have any cards in the suit named, then they may discard any other card.\n\n:When a player who has the lead has no hukms, he may ask his partner which suit he should lead. Thus the partner can indicate a suit in which he has a hukm, so that the partnership can keep the lead. If the partner names a suit that the leader does not have in hand, the leader must decide himself which card to lead, without asking for more guidance.\n\n:If the opponents succeed in winning a single trick then they win the game.\n\n===Naqsh===\nThis game can be played with any pack of cards, including the Mughal types, and the shorter 48 card decks. European style packs can be used by removing the jacks. Each suit therefore has two court cards, and ten numeral cards. The game has some similarities with [[Blackjack]]. In Naqsh the 'Mir' (or King) is given a value of 12 points, and the second court card, the 'Ghodi' (or Vizir, Cavalier or Queen) is worth 11. The other cards are worth their pip values, including the ace which has a value of 1. Several players can play the game. Mr. Gordhandas suggests 5-7 players, with 6 being the ideal number. The aim is to achieve a total value of 17 with the first two cards dealt, or the nearest number below this total. Players with low value cards can continue to draw further cards to try to improve their total. Variations can be played where 21 is a target total (but only if made with a King and a 9, or a Vizier and a ten), or where different winning combinations are accepted such as pairs, triples and so on. The game is suited to gambling.<ref>Based on article by Mr. Kishor Gordhandas: http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=india&CraftCode=003675 retrieved 3/1/2015.</ref>\n\n==Notable Ganjifa card collections and collectors==\n* The national playing cards museum of Germany, the 'Deutsches Spielkartenmuseum', in the town of Leinfelden.\n* The Cary collection, housed in the Beinecke Library, Yale University (USA).\n* The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (India), which has a substantial online display of many different Ganjifa cards (http://www.ignca.nic.in).\n* \n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London has at least six sets of Ganjifa cards in its collection.

He identified them as Persian by the style and quality.]]\nGanjifa cards are circular or rectangular,<ref>A rectangular example dated to around 1770 is held in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France. See http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55007315w/f13.item</ref> and traditionally hand-painted by [[artisan]]s. The game became popular at the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court, and lavish sets were made, from materials such as precious stone-inlaid ivory or tortoise shell (''darbar kalam''). The game later spread to the general public, whereupon cheaper sets (''baz\u00e2r kalam'') would be made from materials such as [[wood]], [[palm tree|palm leaf]], stiffened cloth or pasteboard. Typically Ganjifa cards have coloured backgrounds, with each suit having a different colour. Different types exist, and the designs, number of suits, and physical size of the cards can vary considerably. With the exception of Mamluk Kanjifa and the Chads of Mysore, each suit contains ten [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]] and two [[face card|court cards]], the king and the [[vizier]] or minister. The backs of the cards are typically a uniform colour, without patterning.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe earliest origins of the cards remain uncertain, but Ganjifa cards as they are known today are believed to have originated in [[Persia]]. The first syllable is attributed to the Persian word 'ganj' meaning treasure. Gen. [[Albert Houtum-Schindler|Houtum-Schindler]] suggested to [[Stewart Culin]] that the last two syllables in the word 'Ganjifa' may be derived from the Chinese chi-p'ai, meaning playing cards <ref>(Culin p928)</ref><ref>Andy Pollett covers this line of argument on http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards25.htm (retrieved 03/01/2015).</ref> In a related passage [[William Andrew Chatto|Chatto]] explains that an early Chinese term was 'ya-pae', meaning 'bone ticket', and that the term 'che-pae' came later, meaning literally 'paper ticket'(1848: 58). These different terms could account for the different spellings and pronunciations of 'Ganjifa'. Rolf Zimmermann goes further in his 2006 article, and suggests that the first syllable of the word Ganjifa could come from 'Han' as in [[Han Chinese]], and thus 'Ganjifa' would mean 'han-chi-pai', or '[[Chinese playing cards]]'.<ref>(Retrieved from Szent Istv\u00e1n t\u00e9r on 03/01/2015)</ref> These remain unproved theories, but the 18th century traveller [[Carsten Niebuhr]] claimed to have seen Arabian merchants in Bombay playing with Chinese cards.<ref>(Niebuhr 1774: 173)</ref> In the 19th century [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Jean Louis Burckhardt]] visited Mecca and wrote that 'cards are played in almost every Arab coffee-house (they use small Chinese cards)'.<ref>(Burckhardt 1829: 377)</ref>\n\nGanjifa became popular in [[India]] under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors in the 16th century. The term has been used at times in many countries throughout the Middle East and western Asia. In Kuwait, the word 'Janjifah' has become a general term and so is applied to the internationally known [[French playing cards|French deck]].<ref>In Arabic and Persian, there exists also the more general word for playing cards, 'waraq' ( \u0648\u0631\u0642 ). This word can be found in texts that may refer to Ganjifa cards. For example in the 16th century work, the Humayun-namah, about the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]], this term 'waraq' is used. The text describes a gambling game that was played during celebrations upon Humayun's return to [[Kabul]] in 1545. The game involved twelve players, each with twenty cards. Refer Beveridge (1902: 178, or 77 in the Persian section of the book).</ref>\n\n===Arabic sources and surviving cards===\n[[File:Mamluk kanjifah cards.png|thumb|320px|Four Mamluk playing cards]]\nDespite the significance of Persia in the history of ganjifa cards, the very earliest known text reference ([[Ibn Taghribirdi]]) and card specimens ([[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk era]]) are from Egypt.\n\nAn exhibition in the British museum in 2013 noted \"Playing cards are known in Egypt from the twelfth century AD. Ganjafeh was a popular card game in Iran and the Arab world.\" For example, the word 'kanjifah' ( \u0643\u0646\u062c\u0641\u0629 ) is written in the top right corner of the king of swords, on the Mamluk Egyptian deck witnessed by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer|L.A. Mayer]] in the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] museum. The Mamluk cards are difficult to date with any certainty, but Mayer estimated these cards to be from the 15th century.  The piece of playing card collected by [[Edmund de Unger]] may be from the period of the 12-14th centuries.<ref>(Mayer 1971: 9); See also the discussion on the [[Playing card#Early history|early history of playing cards]].</ref> The term Kanjifah can be found in the 1839 Calcutta edition of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]], in Arabic, at the end of night 460. The first known reference can be found in a 15th-century Arabic text, written by the Egyptian historian [[Ibn Taghribirdi]] (died 1470). In his history of Egypt he mentions how the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mu'ayyad played kanjafah for money when he was an emir.<ref>The text is described in English by [[Richard Ettinghausen]], in his article \"Further Comments on Mamluk Playing Cards\". The quote refers to the work of [[Ibn Taghribirdi]], called \"Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira\". Ettinghausen notes that the reference comes in the section describing events from the year 820H or 1417-1418 AD (1984: 1194). The original Arabic text can be found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=QCvC39URTY4C&lpg=PP1&dq=editions%3Ae0XIWB1KOVMC&pg=PT535 (Google E-book) or http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-11988/page-4536 .

(1895) [http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html Chinese Origin of Playing Cards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302040523/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Wilkinson/Wilkinson.html |date=2016-03-02 }}. The American Anthropologist, Volume VIII, pp. 61-78.</ref> He was unaware of the existence of the Mamluk cards since Mayer did not make his discovery until 1939. The similarities between the Latin European cards and Chinese money-suited cards become more apparent when the Mamluk Kanjifa is described. Looking at the actual games played with Ganjifa cards, Andrew Leibs points out that the cards are divided into strong and weak suits, and in one set the order of the numerical cards is reversed, so that the order runs King, Vizier, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the weakest. This feature can also be found in the old games of [[Tarot card games|Tarot]], [[Ombre]], and [[Spoil Five|Maw]] played in Europe, and the Chinese money-suited card game of '[[Madiao]]'.

All the cards are of the [[As-Nas]] type, rather than the older 8-suited variety.</ref>\nIn 1895, General [[Albert Houtum-Schindler]] described ganjifeh and As-Nas with the following comments:<ref>Quoted by [[Stewart Culin]]</ref>\n\n:\"The word ganjifeh is in Persian now only employed for European playing-cards (four suits, ace to ten; three picture cards each suit), which, however, are also called ''rarak i \u00e2s'' - ''rarak i \u00e2san\u00e2s'' - or simply ''\u00e2s'', from the game ''\u00e2s'' or ''[[As-Nas|\u00e2san\u00e2s]]''.

This ur-ganjifeh would be similar to kanjifa but with only two court cards, the king and the viceroy/vizier. The second viceroy rank found in the kanjifa pack is not based on any historical title and may be a Mamluk invention. According to his hypothesis, the Chinese money-suited pack entered Persia where the Persians added three new ranks: the 10, viceroy, and king to make a 48-card pack. He suggests the Persians eventually changed most of the Chinese suits to fit their culture while the Mamluks were more conservative with the suits. The addition of new suits in both Persia and India was to make the game more challenging as memory is the most important skill in the eponymous [[trick-taking game]].<ref name=\"Dummett\" /> Chinese money-suited cards copied their pips directly from Chinese banknotes.

This decline has several aspects.\n\n* Improvements in printing techniques and machinery allowed manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere to improve their output and further expand their export of playing cards. Manufacturers introduced steam powered machines, [[lithography]] and later [[Offset printing]] during the 19th century. For example, the town of Turnhout in Belgium was a centre of playing cards manufacture. The Turnhout manufacturer Brepols installed steam powered equipment in 1852, lithographic printing of playing cards in 1862, and began offset printing in 1920.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, pages 23-25</ref> In the period around 1900 the French manufacturer Camoin<ref>See also French wikipedia article [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Camoin]]</ref> exported cards to North Africa, and the Middle East as far as the Persian Gulf.<ref>p81-2, Cartes \u00e0 jouer & tarots de Marseille: La donation Camoin</ref> The Indian market was so significant for the Belgian manufacturer 'Biermans' that a factory was established in Calcutta in 1934.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 27</ref> In 1938 playing card exports from the US to India totalled some 888,603 packs, and 60,344 packs were exported to Iraq.<ref>Bureau of the Census pages 642-3</ref> For the Ottoman Empire some European manufacturers produced cards with specific designs, known as 'cartes turques' and 'cartes orientales'. These were essentially 4-suited European style designs, but the aces featured scenic prints adapted to the target market.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 18, and on p.22 an example is shown from the Turnhout manufacturer Gl\u00e9nisson, from the second half of the 19th Century. The ace has a double-headed design, with a scene of the modern city of Istanbul on one end, and a scene of the historic city on the other, when it was called [[Constantinople]]. The titles are written using the Arabic alphabet.</ref>\n* Ganjifa cards were less suited to Western card games. The invention of games such as [[Euchre]], [[History of contract bridge|Bridge]], [[History of poker|Poker]], and [[Rummy]] can be seen as significant events and Western style playing cards are best suited to these games. In Iran, the game of As-Nas largely fell out of fashion by around 1945.<ref>Article from the Brooklyn Museum website, consulted 15/11/2014 \"As nas became popular under the Qajars and continued to be played until the end of World War II, when it lost favor to games such as poker, rummy, and bridge.\".

With regards to India, European style cards were introduced during the colonial period, with demand coming from the wealthier classes.<ref>Crestin Billet (2002:188)</ref> Some cards were imported, some were made by hand using traditional techniques, and others were made by Indian industrialists.

Title: ZENITH 515 BRIDGE PLAYING CARDS</ref>\n* Taxes on playing cards. States used taxes on playing cards to generate revenue, and required specific stamps or wrappers on packs of cards. Such arrangements can create barriers for smaller manufacturers producing cards by hand. The Ottoman Empire introduced taxes on playing cards in 1904.<ref>Autenboer & Cremers, page 26</ref>\n* Playing cards monopolies. In many countries state monopolies were established to control imports and production. Such monopolies tend to standardise card designs, or create conditions that better suit larger manufacturers that can win government contracts or meet the necessary conditions. In Iran, the monopoly was set up following the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act of 1931. The British playing card manufacturer [[De La Rue]] was commissioned to provide cards during the 1930s. The cards featured indexing in [[Persian language|Persian]] and court card images that evoked Persian history. Nonetheless the cards used Western style suits, and so the commissioning of the cards reinforced the position of Western-style 4-suited printed cards.\n\nBy the 21st-century, the only place with a significant community of ganjifa makers and players is [[Odisha]] in the east of India. They use [[ganjapa]], the local variation known for abstract and highly stylized suit symbols and extra suits.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Ten Playing Cards (Ganjifa) LACMA M.2001.210.4.1-.10.jpg|thumb|Various Ganjifa cards from [[Dashavatara]] set]]\n* '''Moghul Ganjifa'''<ref>For more information and images refer to pattern sheet 67 of the International Playing Card Society (website: http://www.i-p-c-s.org).

This is the game most commonly associated with ganjifa cards, each player playing for him or herself. The objective is to win the most cards by taking tricks. At least three players are required. In some games 4 players play individually, and it is also possible to play in pairs. The rules vary, but generally the following apply:\n\n:In the simplest form of the game there is no concept of a '[[trump (card games)|trump]] suit' that beats cards in other suits.<ref>A variant is possible where the 'lead suit' as described below is the trump suit.</ref> A trick can only be won by a card of the same suit. When a player is not in position to win a trick there is no obligation to [[follow suit|follow the suit]] led.\n\n:In all cases the King ('mir' or 'shah') is always the strongest card in each suit, followed by the Vizier. However, in half the suits the numerical cards rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and the other suits the order of the numerical cards is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.<ref>This feature of a reversed order in the number cards of half the suits can be found in some European games, notably [[Ombre]], [[Spoil Five|Maw]], and [[Tarot card games|most games]] played with [[Tarot]] cards. For the game of Ombre see the rules given by Peter Arnold, for example (2010:88), and Chatto points out this similarity between the rules of Ganjifa and those of Ombre (1848:45). An Italian account explains how this feature of Ombre also applied to the game played with the [[Minchiate]] tarot cards (Brunetti 1747:16)(direct link https://books.google.com/books?id=x_1dAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA16 ). The suits of cups (coppe) and coins (denari) are those with the reversed order of the number cards. In France this inverted order did feature for a time in the game of [[French Tarot]], at least in some regions, although it has now disappeared from the modern standard rules. The book 'Tarot, Jeu et Magie' points to two literary sources that mention this feature, from the 18th and 19th centuries (1984:122-124)(link, text in French, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6532698n ).</ref> If playing with a Moghul type pack, the suits with the 'reverse order' numerical cards are barat, zar-e zorkh, qomash, and chang (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e saf\u012bd (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs the suits with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols).\n\n:Before the start of play stakes are agreed if the game is being played for money. At the end of the round the losing player pays this stake value, multiplied by the difference in number of tricks taken between the winner and the loser.\n\n====Dealing====\n:Players draw cards at the beginning to determine who will deal. Traditionally players would sit on a sheet or large cloth on the floor, and the cards are mixed face down in the middle of the cloth, rather than shuffled in the manner of Western cards.\n\n:The deal and the order of the play follows an anti-clockwise direction. The dealer deals out all the cards. According to custom cards may be dealt in batches of four, rather than individually. Some accounts stipulate that the first batch and last batch dealt to each player are dealt face up.<ref>These are the rules given by Shrikrisna Maudranalay, and also those in the account by Chatto (1848: 42)</ref>\n\n:Players should sort their cards into suits and put them in order. For convenience, due to the large number of cards, players often separate any low value pip cards and keep them to the side, keeping only the more valuable cards in hand. When discarding during play these low value cards are used indifferently.\n\n====Play====\n:During the game players must try to keep track of the cards that have been played. The highest outstanding cards left in play in each suit are called 'hukm', corresponding to the Persian word \" \u062d\u06a9\u0645 \".<ref>[[Court piece|Hukm (or Hokm)]] is the name of a card game played in modern Iran. It is of the same general family of games as the ganjifa trick taking game. Play is to the right (counterclockwise), cards are dealt in batches, and as in ganjifa, the player that leads the game is one that receives a high card (in the case of Hokm, an ace). Refer to http://www.pagat.com/whist/hokm.html</ref>\n\n:The player to lead is the one holding the King in a certain suit. This 'lead suit' varies according to the type of pack, and also according to whether the game is played during the day (between sunrise and sunset) or during the night. With a Moghul pack the lead suits are zar-e zorkh (red gold coins, or figuratively 'suns') by day, and zar-e safid (white gold coins or figuratively 'moons') by night. If playing with Dashavtar cards the lead suits are Rama by day, and Krishna by night. The player holding the King in this lead suit begins by playing two cards at once - the King and another low card. The other players cannot win, and so they each discard two low cards which are won by the player who led the game. This player then leads again. At this point accounts of the game rules differ. The rules below on gameplay are based on the description by John McLeod.<ref>Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997.

Players must lead as follows, in order of priority: 1) If the lead player has a continuous series of winning cards in a suit, then this sequence must be led, with the exception of the last card in the sequence which is kept for later. 2) The next possibility is a move called 'deni'. This is possible when a player lacks the hukm in a given suit, but has the second highest outstanding card. In this case the player may lead a low card in that suit, and call for the hukm. The opponent with the hukm then wins the trick but the player that made the 'deni' move retains the lead, which is the advantage of making this move. If the player with the hukm also holds the third highest card in the suit, he may play this card as well, and it is said that the deni is doubled. In this case everyone plays a second card and the player with the hukm wins two tricks. However the lead still returns to the player who made the deni move. 3) When a leader cannot make either of the two leads described above, he then leads out any remaining hukm cards, all at once, a move called 'utari'.<ref>Noted by Wilkins (2002: 195). Compare also the definition given by Maudranalay, page 16.</ref> In McLeod's account this is the only option available to a player at this stage, so a player would need to lead any hukms they might have, and then pass the lead as described next in step 4. However in the rules given by Wilkins there is a second option, whereby the player can instead simply lead a low card or non-winning card of his choosing to pass the lead.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\">Wilkins (2002:195)</ref> 4) If a player has no further valid options for leading cards, he gives up the lead by shuffling his hand, and placing the cards face down. The player to his right then selects the card that he must lead, for example by saying 'fourth from the top' or pointing to a card if they are spread out. The lead then passes to the player who wins the trick, who then follows the same sequence of possible leads as described above.\n\n:In some accounts there is an end phase or secondary phase to the game, in which the leading rules are simplified or changed. According to McLeod, when the players get down to the last 12 cards, steps 1 and 2 described above are skipped, and a player starts by leading out all his hukms directly. After doing so, the player must try to lead a card from a suit named by his right-hand neighbour. If he cannot lead this suit the lead is passed as described in step 4 above, with the player's cards shuffled and placed face down. In Wilkins' account, there is also a second phase to the game, which applies when all the players have held and lost the lead once. From this point onwards hukm cards are played individually instead of in batches. Furthermore, in this second phase, if a player leads a low card, it is played face down and the player can freely choose the suit which must be followed.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:The round continues until all the cards have been played. At this point the players can count their tricks and decide any payments or forfeits that must be paid. However in the rules described by Chatto there a final round played using the cards won in tricks. This is a challenging game called 'Ser-k'hel'. Players shuffle their tricks, and the winner of the last trick plays one trick blind against a player of his choice. The winner of this trick then challenges the player to his right in the same way.<ref>Chatto (1848:43)</ref>\n\n====Following rounds====\n:In some accounts losing players are disadvantaged when starting the next round. One possibility is that players are required to use the cards won in tricks for playing with in the following round. Players who are short on cards have to buy cards from other players to make up the difference.<ref>See Chatto (1848:43)</ref> Alternatively, cards can be shuffled and distributed equally, but losing players are required to exchange cards with winning players. The losing player must give cards at random, without looking at them, and the winning player is allowed to return low value cards, sorted from his hand. The number of cards exchanged is the difference in the number of tricks won in the last round.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:The total number of rounds played may vary. In Chatto's account a full game is made up of four rounds. In the version described by Maudranalay, there is no fixed number of rounds, rather the game must continue round after round until a losing player (presumably meaning a player who lost the previous round of gameplay) beats the card led by another player on the last trick of the round.<ref>Maudranalay, page 16.</ref> This last lead card is called the 'akheri', from a word for 'last' (which exists in persian and Arabic ( \u0622\u062e\u0631 ). In Wilkin's account, this event has a different significance. Wilkins writes that if a player beats the akheri card, he is exempted from paying any forfeit money going into the next round.<ref name=\"Wilkins 2002:195\"/>\n\n:An adaptation is possible if players use the international 52 card pack. In this case the game is for three players only, and the 2 of diamonds is removed so that players each receive 17 cards each. The lead suit is always spades. In an account about gameplay in northern India (before the creation of Pakistan), Shurreef writes that the King is referred to as 'Badshah' (corresponding to the Persian term 'Padishah'), the queen as 'Bibia' (Persian term 'Bibi'), and the Jack as the 'Ghulam', meaning 'slave'.<ref>Shurreef (1999:336).</ref>\n\n===Partnership Ganjifa===\nPlayed in partnerships (two against two). Some call this game 'Dugi'.<ref>See IPCS paper 'Ganjifa - the traditional playing cards of India', by Jeff Hopewell, p63. The name 'Dugi' is used in Digapahandi (Orissa)</ref> In this game the order of the suits and the cards is the same as for the individual ganjifa trick taking game described above, however the aim of the game is for one partnership to win all the tricks. The partnership dealt the King in the lead suit has to take on this challenge. It is possible to determine the lead suit by the day or night rule as above, or by cutting cards. The following game rules are taken from an account by John McLeod<ref>Online post by John McLeod (webmaster of card game rules site www.pagat.com) on the newsgroup rec.games.playing-cards on March 25, 1997, in reply to a thread entitled \"Ganjifa, Classic Indian card game\", started by James Kilfiger on March 22, 1997. The newsgroup can be browsed for example via google: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rec.games.playing-cards .

Before starting, the lead king can be passed from one partner to another in exchange for another card of the same suit.\n\n:When leading, a player must lead all the 'hukms' that they have in hand (these are the highest cards remaining in a given suit, that are sure to win). Players must follow suit if they are able to do so. If this is not possible, the leading player names another suit, and they must discard their highest card in that suit. If they do not have any cards in the suit named, then they may discard any other card.\n\n:When a player who has the lead has no hukms, he may ask his partner which suit he should lead. Thus the partner can indicate a suit in which he has a hukm, so that the partnership can keep the lead. If the partner names a suit that the leader does not have in hand, the leader must decide himself which card to lead, without asking for more guidance.\n\n:If the opponents succeed in winning a single trick then they win the game.\n\n===Naqsh===\nThis game can be played with any pack of cards, including the Mughal types, and the shorter 48 card decks. European style packs can be used by removing the jacks. Each suit therefore has two court cards, and ten numeral cards. The game has some similarities with [[Blackjack]]. In Naqsh the 'Mir' (or King) is given a value of 12 points, and the second court card, the 'Ghodi' (or Vizir, Cavalier or Queen) is worth 11. The other cards are worth their pip values, including the ace which has a value of 1. Several players can play the game. Mr. Gordhandas suggests 5-7 players, with 6 being the ideal number. The aim is to achieve a total value of 17 with the first two cards dealt, or the nearest number below this total. Players with low value cards can continue to draw further cards to try to improve their total. Variations can be played where 21 is a target total (but only if made with a King and a 9, or a Vizier and a ten), or where different winning combinations are accepted such as pairs, triples and so on. The game is suited to gambling.<ref>Based on article by Mr. Kishor Gordhandas: http://www.craftrevival.org/CraftArtDetails.asp?CountryCode=india&CraftCode=003675 retrieved 3/1/2015.</ref>\n\n==Notable Ganjifa card collections and collectors==\n* The national playing cards museum of Germany, the 'Deutsches Spielkartenmuseum', in the town of Leinfelden.\n* The Cary collection, housed in the Beinecke Library, Yale University (USA).\n* The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (India), which has a substantial online display of many different Ganjifa cards (http://www.ignca.nic.in).\n* \n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London has at least six sets of Ganjifa cards in its collection.

{"title_page": "Utility system", "text_new": "In [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|video game AI]], a '''utility system''', or '''utility AI''', is a simple but effective way to [[Behavior modelling|model behaviors]] for [[non-player character]]s. Using numbers, formulas, and scores to rate the relative benefit of possible actions, one can assign [[Utility|utilities]] to each [[Action selection|action]]. A behavior can then be selected based on which one scores the highest \"utility\" or by using those scores to seed the [[probability distribution]] for a weighted random selection. The result is that the character is selecting the \"best\" behavior for the given situation at the moment based on how those behaviors are defined mathematically.\n\n== Key Concepts ==\n\nThe concept of [[utility]] has been around for centuries -- primarily in mathematically dependent areas such as [[economics]]. However, it has also been used in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and even [[biology]]. Because of this background and the inherent nature of needing to convert things to math for computer programming, it was something that came naturally as a way of designing and expressing behaviors for game characters.  \n\nNaturally, different AI architectures have their various pros and cons. One of the benefits of utility AI is that it is less \"hand-authored\" than many other types of game AI architectures<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Dave|title=AI Architectures: A Culinary Guide|url=http://intrinsicalgorithm.com/IAonAI/2012/11/ai-architectures-a-culinary-guide-gdmag-article/|date=August 2012}}</ref>. While behaviors in a utility system are often created individually (and by hand), the interactions and priorities between them isn't inherently specified. For example, [[Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)|behavior trees]] (BTs) require the designer to specify priorities in sequence to check if something should be done. Only if that behavior (or tree branch) is NOT executed will the behavior tree system fall through to check the next one. \n\nBy comparison, behaviors in many utility systems sort themselves out by priority based on the scores generated by any mathematical modeling that defines every given behavior. Because of this, the developer isn't required to determine exactly where the new behavior \"fits\" in the overall scheme of what could be 1000s of behavior \"nodes\" in a BT. Instead, the focus is on simply defining the specific reasons why the single behavior in question would be beneficial (i.e. it's \"utility\"). The decision system then scores each behavior according to what is happening in the world at that moment and selects the best one. While some care must be taken to ensure that standards are being followed so that all behavior scoring is using the same or similar premises, the \"heavy lifting\" of determining how to process 10s \u2014 or even 100s \u2014 of different behaviors is offloaded from the designer and put into the execution of the system itself. \n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Early Use ===\nNumbers and formulas and scores have been used for decades in games to define behavior. Even something as simple as a defining a set percentage chance for something to happen (e.g. 12% chance to perform Action X) was an early step into utility AI. Only in the past  15-20 years, however, has that method started to take on more of a formalized approach now referred to commonly as \"utility AI\".\n\n=== Mathematical Modeling of Behavior ===\n\nIn [[The Sims]] (2000) an NPCs current \"need\" for something (e.g. rest, food, social activity) was combined with a score from an object or activity that could satisfy that same need. The combinations of these values gave a score to the action that told the Sim what it should do. This was one of the first ''visible'' uses of utility AI in a game. While the player didn't see the calculations themselves, they were made aware of the relative needs of the Sim and the varying degrees of satisfaction that objects in the game would provide.

Using numbers, formulas, and scores to rate the relative benefit of possible actions, one can assign [[Utility|utilities]] to each [[Action selection|action]]. A behavior can then be selected based on which one scores the highest \"utility\" or by using those scores to seed the [[probability distribution]] for a weighted random selection. The result is that the character is selecting the \"best\" behavior for the given situation at the moment based on how those behaviors are defined mathematically.\n\n== Key Concepts ==\n\nThe concept of [[utility]] has been around for centuries -- primarily in mathematically dependent areas such as [[economics]]. However, it has also been used in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and even [[biology]]. Because of this background and the inherent nature of needing to convert things to math for computer programming, it was something that came naturally as a way of designing and expressing behaviors for game characters.  \n\nNaturally, different AI architectures have their various pros and cons. One of the benefits of utility AI is that it is less \"hand-authored\" than many other types of game AI architectures<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Dave|title=AI Architectures: A Culinary Guide|url=http://intrinsicalgorithm.com/IAonAI/2012/11/ai-architectures-a-culinary-guide-gdmag-article/|date=August 2012}}</ref>. While behaviors in a utility system are often created individually (and by hand), the interactions and priorities between them isn't inherently specified. For example, [[Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)|behavior trees]] (BTs) require the designer to specify priorities in sequence to check if something should be done. Only if that behavior (or tree branch) is NOT executed will the behavior tree system fall through to check the next one. \n\nBy comparison, behaviors in many utility systems sort themselves out by priority based on the scores generated by any mathematical modeling that defines every given behavior. Because of this, the developer isn't required to determine exactly where the new behavior \"fits\" in the overall scheme of what could be 1000s of behavior \"nodes\" in a BT. Instead, the focus is on simply defining the specific reasons why the single behavior in question would be beneficial (i.e. it's \"utility\"). The decision system then scores each behavior according to what is happening in the world at that moment and selects the best one. While some care must be taken to ensure that standards are being followed so that all behavior scoring is using the same or similar premises, the \"heavy lifting\" of determining how to process 10s \u2014 or even 100s \u2014 of different behaviors is offloaded from the designer and put into the execution of the system itself. \n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Early Use ===\nNumbers and formulas and scores have been used for decades in games to define behavior. Even something as simple as a defining a set percentage chance for something to happen (e.g. 12% chance to perform Action X) was an early step into utility AI. Only in the past  15-20 years, however, has that method started to take on more of a formalized approach now referred to commonly as \"utility AI\".\n\n=== Mathematical Modeling of Behavior ===\n\nIn [[The Sims]] (2000) an NPCs current \"need\" for something (e.g. rest, food, social activity) was combined with a score from an object or activity that could satisfy that same need. The combinations of these values gave a score to the action that told the Sim what it should do. This was one of the first ''visible'' uses of utility AI in a game. While the player didn't see the calculations themselves, they were made aware of the relative needs of the Sim and the varying degrees of satisfaction that objects in the game would provide. It was, in fact, the core gameplay mechanism.\n\nIn [[The Sims 3]] (2009), Richard Evans used a modified version of the [[Boltzmann distribution]] is used to choose an action for a Sim, using a [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] that is low when the Sim is happy, and high when the Sim is doing badly to make it more likely that an action with a low utility is chosen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Richard|title=Modeling Individual Personalities in The Sims 3|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012450/Modeling-Individual-Personalities-in-The|website=GDC Vault|accessdate=21 September 2015|pages=36\u201338}}</ref> He also incorporated \"personalities\" into the Sims.

Using a technique taught to him by his trainer, former [[Welterweight]] and [[Middleweight]] Champion [[Tommy Ryan]], Jeffries fought out of a crouch with his left arm extended forward. He was able to absorb tremendous punishment while wearing his opponents down. A natural left-hander, he possessed one-punch knockout power in his left hook, and brawled his way to the top of the rankings. He is perhaps most famous for being United States \"Great White Hope\", since the nation expected him to come out of his retirement to beat the African-American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], who was at the time the Heavyweight Champion.<ref>https://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/bibliographic_entity%7Cvideo_work%7C1789067?ssotoken=anonymous</ref>\n\nJeffries stood {{convert|6|ft|1+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on}} tall and weighed {{convert|225|lb}} in his prime. He could run {{convert|100|yd|m}} in just over ten seconds, and could high jump over {{convert|6|ft|cm}}.\n\n==Early life==\nJeffries moved with his family from their Ohio farm to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] at age seven.<ref>http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/jeffries.html</ref> He worked for a while as a [[boilermaker]] before going into boxing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=1409&more=1|title=WardDawsonSDown2|author=ES Boxing|work=Boxing News 24/7}}</ref> In later life, \"The Boilermaker\" was one of his professional nicknames.\n\n==Career==\nAs a powerfully built and athletic teenager, Jeffries boxed as an amateur until age 20, when he started fighting professionally.\n\nIn his third fight, Jeffries knocked out the highly regarded boxer [[Hank Griffin (boxer)|Hank Griffin]] in the fourteenth round. [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] would subsequently fight Griffin on three separate occasions.\n\nJeffries fought the top heavyweight contender, Gus Ruhlin, to a draw. Ruhlin was knocked down with a brutal punch at the end of the final round and was saved by the bell from being counted out. The decision was met with unfavorable reactions from the audience, many of whom felt Jeffries won.\n\nOn his way to the title in 1898, Jeffries knocked out [[Peter Jackson (boxer)|Peter Jackson]], the great boxer whom [[John L. Sullivan]] had refused to fight, in three rounds. This had been only the second defeat in Jackson's entire career; his first loss was from a four-round fight over thirteen years earlier around the beginning of his career. Jackson retired shortly afterward.\n\nJeffries defeated the formidable Mexican Pete Everett by knockout in only the third round on April 22, 1898.\n\nHis next fight was against the Irishman [[Tom Sharkey]]. The fight went the full twenty rounds and Sharkey was knocked down in the eleventh round. Jeffries won the decision.\n\nAfter defeating the big, fast-moving, sharp-jabbing [[Bob Armstrong (boxer)|Bob Armstrong]], Jeffries had earned the right to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn June 9, 1899 in [[Brooklyn, New York]] he defeated [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] by KO in the eleventh round to win the [[Heavyweight]] Championship of the World. That August, he embarked on a tour of [[Europe]], putting on exhibition fights for the fans. Jeffries was involved in several motion pictures recreating portions of his championship fights. Filmed portions of his other bouts and of some of his exhibition matches survive to this day.\n\n===World Heavyweight Champion===\nIn his first title defense, he won a twenty-five-round decision in a rematch over Tom Sharkey.\n\nJeffries set the record for the quickest KO in a Heavyweight title fight ever, which was 55 seconds against Jack Finnegan in his second title defense.\n\nHis next defense was against the former [[Heavyweight]] Champion and legendary technician, [[James J. Corbett]]. Corbett had put up a perfect defense and could have arguably won had the fight gone the distance. However, Corbett was knocked out cold from a left to the jaw in the twenty-third round of the scheduled twenty-five round fight.\n\nJeffries later got the chance to avenge his controversial draw with Gus Ruhlin when he defended his title against him on November 15, 1901. Claims that Ruhlin quit during the fifth round are incorrect. All of the local next-day San Francisco sources agree that Ruhlin's manager, Billy Madden, threw in the towel to retire Gus during the one-minute interval between the fifth and sixth rounds.\n\nAn example of Jeffries' ability to absorb punishment and recover from a severe battering to win a bout came in his rematch for the title with Fitzsimmons, who is regarded as one of the hardest punchers in boxing history. The rematch with Jeffries occurred on July 25, 1902 in [[San Francisco]]. To train for the bout Jeffries' daily training included a {{convert|14|mi|km|sing=on}} run, 2 hours of skipping rope, medicine ball training, 20 minutes sparring on the heavy bag, and at least 12 rounds of sparring in the ring. He also trained in wrestling.\n\nFor nearly eight rounds Fitzsimmons subjected Jeffries to a vicious battering. Jeffries suffered a broken nose, both his cheeks were cut to the bone, and gashes were opened over both eyes. It appeared that the fight would have to be stopped, as blood freely flowed into Jeffries' eyes. Then in the eighth round, Jeffries lashed out with a terrific right to the stomach, followed by a left hook to the jaw which knocked Fitzsimmons unconscious.\n\nJeffries and Corbett met one last time in the ring on August 14, 1903. This time Jeffries was in total control for all ten rounds of the scheduled twenty round bout. Tommy Ryan, Corbett's chief second, threw a large palm-leaf fan into the ring to alert Referee Graney that he should stop the fight.\n\nJeffries had his seventh and final title defense against Canadian Jack Munroe, whom he stopped in only two rounds.\n\nJeffries broke the ribs of three opponents in title fights: [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]], Gus Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Jeffries retired undefeated in May 1905. He served as a referee for the next few years, including the bout in which [[Marvin Hart]] defeated [[Jack Root]] to stake a claim at Jeffries' vacated title. Jeffries had never been knocked down in his prime.\n\nJeffries had likely fought many more bouts than twenty-two at this time. Many of his fights were lost in history. Jeffries, however, had never been defeated before his original retirement.\n\n===Comeback: \"The Fight of the Century\"===\n[[File:Johnson jeff.jpg|left|thumb|200px|James Jeffries during his fight with [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]]]\nOver five years after retiring, Jeffries made a comeback on July 4, 1910 at [[Reno, Nevada]] in a match against champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], who had won the [[Heavyweight]] Championship in 1908 by defeating Canadian champion [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]] at [[Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|Rushcutters Bay]] in Australia. Burns was the first heavyweight champion to fight African-American challengers.\n\nThe media put pressure onto Jeffries and promoters dangled wealth in front of him to take the fight. He finally acquiesced, saying \"I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a negro.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Zirin |first=Dave|year=2008 |title=\nPeople's History of Sports in the United States: 250 Years of Politics, Protest, People, and Play|publisher=The New Press|page=42|ISBN=1595581006}}</ref> In addition to a guaranteed purse of $40,000 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1910|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), to woo the ex-champ back into the ring, promoter [[Tex Rickard]] had signed him to a $75,000 personal contract.\n\nAfter a six-year lay-off, the 35-year-old Jeffries was out of shape and had lost most of his muscle. Jeffries weighed over 330 pounds (150&nbsp;kg), while Johnson was in superb physical condition. The ex-champ had to lose 110 pounds to get down to his fighting weight of 226, a Herculean task in the time he had before the fight. Previous Heavyweight Champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (an ethnic Irish American who refused to fight African-American contenders) remarked during an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Jeffries' personal doctor was so amazed at Johnson's physical condition that he felt Jeffries could win only if Johnson had a lack of skill on the day. While the media instigated racist remarks about winning the title for whites, Jeffries' final words before the fight were, \"It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible.\" His wife also commented, \"I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight.\"<ref>[http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/04/jack-johnson-jim-jeffries-highlighted-u-s-racial-divide/ \"Jack Johnson-Jim Jeffries Fight Highlighted the US Racial Divide\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193813/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/04/jack-johnson-jim-jeffries-highlighted-u-s-racial-divide/ |date=2012-03-02 }}, 4 July 2010, AOL News</ref>\n\n{{YouTube|L1y76L2P-IQ|Motion picture footage}} of Jeffries on the morning of the fight depicts a relaxed man playing with his dog. Ringside seats that had been priced at $50 were being scalped at $125 each (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125|1910|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). More than 1,000 spectators who were unable to get seats in the sold-out arena climbed over the walls to enter.\n\nBefore the fight, which was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, famous boxers who had traveled to Reno to witness the contest were introduced to the crowd, including [[Sam Langford]], a black boxer who was unable to secure a title fight, even from Jack Johnson. The greatest applause went to [[Jake Kilrain]], who had battled John L. Sullivan back in the bare-knuckle days.\n\nAt three minutes to one P.M., Johnson entered the ring (his contract provided that he would always be first to enter the ring, to satisfy a superstition of his). The thermometer read 110\u00b0 Fahrenheit, which meant the match would be even more brutal due to heat. Jeffries soon joined Johnson in the ring. Rickard served as referee. (Johnson and Jeffries could not agree on a referee, and Rickard's publicity-minded offers to President [[William Howard Taft]] and writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to serve as referee were declined. Rickard took the position although he had never refereed a prize fight before.)\n\nIn the first three rounds, the boxers sparred to feel each other out. Johnson, having read that no one could tie Jeffries up on the inside due to his power, told the press that not only would he do so, but that he planned to neutralize Jeffries' power by twisting his arms behind him. Toward the end of the fourth round, he did just that, pinning Jeffries' arms in back of him for a moment, but Jeffries broke the clinch. Johnson landed a solid overhand right to Jeffries' head just before the bell.\n\nJohnson began dominating the fight in rounds five through twelve, as his opponent faded in the heat and from Johnson's onslaught. The heat began to get to Johnson, too, by round 13, but he was still the stronger and younger man in the ring. Toward the end of that round, he delivered a right and a right uppercut to Jeffries' head that took their toll. In the next round, Jeffries eluded Johnson, who stalked him all over the ring.\n\nIn round 15, Johnson went after Jeffries and caught him against the ropes with a right upper-cut, followed by three left uppercuts that sent the ex-champ to the canvas for the first time in his career. He could no longer put up a defense and, as Jeffries got up, Johnson hit him with a left hook that sent him to the canvas and through the ropes, putting his torso outside the ring. Helped to his feet by one of his seconds and a fan, as soon as Jeffries was back in the ring he was rushed by Johnson, who knocked him down again with a right to the head. As Rickard moved in to separate the fighters, Jeffries got up, but his manager had entered the ring to stop the fight and save his fighter from being knocked out. Johnson retained the title by a [[technical knockout]].\n\nJohnson later remarked that he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut to Jeffries' face and saw the look in his eyes. \"I knew what that look meant,\" he said. \"The old ship was sinking.\" [[John L. Sullivan]] commented for ''[[The New York Times]]'' after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly, and convincingly:\n\n{{quote|The fight of the century is over and a black man is the undisputed champion of the world. It was a poor fight as fights go, this less than 15-round affair between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Scarcely has there ever been a championship contest that was so one-sided. All of Jeffries much-vaunted condition amounted to nothing. He wasn't in it from the first bell tap to the last \u2026. The negro had few friends, but there was little demonstration against him. (Spectators) could not help but admire Johnson because he is the type of prizefighter that is admired by sportsmen. He played fairly at all times and fought fairly. \u2026 What a crafty, powerful, cunning left hand (Johnson) has. He is one of the craftiest, cunningest boxers that ever stepped into the ring. \u2026 They both fought closely all during the 15 rounds. It was just the sort of fight that Jeffries wanted. There was no running or ducking like Corbett did with me in New Orleans (1892). Jeffries did not miss so many blows, because he hardly started any. Johnson was on top of him all the time.... (Johnson) didn't get gay at all with Jeffries in the beginning, and it was always the white man who clinched, but Johnson was very careful, and he backed away and took no chances, and was good-natured with it all. \u2026 The best man won, and I was one of the first to congratulate him, and also one of the first to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the beaten man.<ref>John L. Sullivan, cited in: Christopher James Shelton, [http://www.ringsideboxingshow.com/SheltonBLOGJohnsonJeffries.html \"'Fight of the Century' Johnson vs. Jeffries, the 100th anniversary\"], Ringside Boxing Show</ref>}}\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn his later years, Jeffries trained boxers and worked as a fight promoter. He promoted many fights out of a structure known as \"Jeffries Barn\", which was located on his alfalfa ranch at the southwest corner of Victory Boulevard and Buena Vista, Burbank, California. (His ranch house was on the southeast corner until the early 1960s.) Jeffries Barn is now part of [[Knott's Berry Farm]], a [[Southern California]] amusement park. \n\nSeven years after suffering a stroke, Jeffries died on March 3, 1953, in bed at his home with his niece Lillian Bull. Bull had been living with Jeffries as his housekeeper and he had instructed her to call a doctor. Jeffries died before the doctor arrived. The doctor, William M. Nethery, attributed his death to a [[heart attack]] caused by [[coronary thrombosis]].<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19530304&id=7DBdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EVsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4372,1685873&hl=en</ref> His body was interred in the [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]] in [[Inglewood, California]].\n\n==Legacy==\nToday, the legacy of Jeffries is widely forgotten. However, he was once considered one of the greatest Heavyweight Champions of all time by many fellow boxers and boxing experts:<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtOjXb3EsW4|title=How Does Jim Jeffries Rank?|date=2 October 2006|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI8mVLPbvLw|title=How Good Was Jim Jeffries?|date=3 October 2006|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n*[[Jack Root]], [[Willie Ritchie]] and [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]], former Light Heavyweight, Lightweight and Heavyweight Champions, respectively, rated Jeffries as the greatest heavyweight.\n*[[James J. Corbett]] said of Jeffries, \"The thing the always impressed me was the speed the youngster had, and he weighed two-hundred-twenty-five pounds. I hold that Jeffries was the greatest Heavyweight Champion of them all.\"\n\n*[[Sam Langford]], the great fighter who fought from lightweight to heavyweight, advertised to fight any man in the world, except Jim Jeffries.\n\n*[[Tom Sharkey]], heavyweight top contender, thought that Jeffries would have beaten [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Joe Louis]] on the same night. He said Jeffries was strong like a bull and quick on his feet like a cat. Sharkey called Jeffries the greatest fighter of all time.\n\n*[[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], the only man to beat Jeffries, stated in an interview with Ring Magazine that he thought Jeffries was the greatest. In another interview, Johnson said Jeffries would beat both Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis.  However, in turn, Jeffries said after their bout: \"I could never have whipped Johnson at my best. I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years.\" <ref name=\"biography.com\">{{cite web|title=Jack Johnson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-johnson-9355980|accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n*Jack Dempsey, the great Heavyweight Champion, once said: \"Jim Jeffries was a tough gun. If we could have gotten in the ring together, each at our best... I probably would have had my chin knocked off.\"\n\n*[[William A. Brady|William Brady]], who managed both Jim Jeffries and Jim Corbett, remarked about Jeffries: \"There was never a man fitted anatomically, physically, and temperamentally for the role of World's Heavyweight Champion.\"\n\n*[[Nat Fleischer]], founder of Ring Magazine and The Ring Record book, described Jeffries: \"One of the most formidable fighting machines the prize ring ever produced.\"\n\n*[[Dan Morgan]], fight manager for forty years, who saw them all, rated Jeffries as the all-time best. Morgan called Jeffries a \"Champion of Champions.\"\n\n*[[Tex Rickard]], famed sportsman and promoter, held the view: \"Big Jim will always live in my memory as the greatest heavyweight boxer of his time. While he reigned supreme, he gave all a chance. He did not know the meaning of the word fear.\"\n\n*W. W. Naughton, sports writer of the day, records: \"To sum up his qualities of ringsmanship, it may be said he is fairly talented in every branch of self-defense. He boxes cleverly, defends himself well, and strikes a hard blow. But back of all these are the qualities which have made him a champion, magnificent strength and wonderful endurance.\"\n\n*Dewitt Van Court, boxing instructor and athletic director of the [[Los Angeles]] Athletic Club wrote: \"I was with James J. Jeffries when he first started to box. I was with him when he won the Championship. I was with him when he lost it. Besides being the greatest Heavyweight Champion that ever lived, he is today and has been all his life, a man among men, a true friend with a heart as big as his body.\"\n\nThe city of Burbank embedded a small bronze plaque in the sidewalk at the site where James Jeffries died. The plaque was located on the southeast side of Buena Vista ~150 yards south of Victory Boulevard, before being stored at Burbank City Hall, and now is located at the Gordon R. Howard Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-me-community-20180604-story.html|title=Community: New exhibit piece at Burbank museum is a real knockout|last=Rudolph|first=Joyce|website=latimes.com|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nJames J.

Using a technique taught to him by his trainer, former [[Welterweight]] and [[Middleweight]] Champion [[Tommy Ryan]], Jeffries fought out of a crouch with his left arm extended forward. He was able to absorb tremendous punishment while wearing his opponents down. A natural left-hander, he possessed one-punch knockout power in his left hook, and brawled his way to the top of the rankings. He is perhaps most famous for being United States \"Great White Hope\", since the nation expected him to come out of his retirement to beat the African-American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], who was at the time the Heavyweight Champion.<ref>https://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/bibliographic_entity%7Cvideo_work%7C1789067?ssotoken=anonymous</ref>\n\nJeffries stood {{convert|6|ft|1+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on}} tall and weighed {{convert|225|lb}} in his prime. He could run {{convert|100|yd|m}} in just over ten seconds, and could high jump over {{convert|6|ft|cm}}.\n\n==Early life==\nJeffries moved with his family from their Ohio farm to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] at age seven.<ref>http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/jeffries.html</ref> He worked for a while as a [[boilermaker]] before going into boxing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=1409&more=1|title=WardDawsonSDown2|author=ES Boxing|work=Boxing News 24/7}}</ref> In later life, \"The Boilermaker\" was one of his professional nicknames.\n\n==Career==\nAs a powerfully built and athletic teenager, Jeffries boxed as an amateur until age 20, when he started fighting professionally.\n\nIn his third fight, Jeffries knocked out the highly regarded boxer [[Hank Griffin (boxer)|Hank Griffin]] in the fourteenth round. [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] would subsequently fight Griffin on three separate occasions.\n\nJeffries fought the top heavyweight contender, Gus Ruhlin, to a draw. Ruhlin was knocked down with a brutal punch at the end of the final round and was saved by the bell from being counted out. The decision was met with unfavorable reactions from the audience, many of whom felt Jeffries won.\n\nOn his way to the title in 1898, Jeffries knocked out [[Peter Jackson (boxer)|Peter Jackson]], the great boxer whom [[John L. Sullivan]] had refused to fight, in three rounds. This had been only the second defeat in Jackson's entire career; his first loss was from a four-round fight over thirteen years earlier around the beginning of his career. Jackson retired shortly afterward.\n\nJeffries defeated the formidable Mexican Pete Everett by knockout in only the third round on April 22, 1898.\n\nHis next fight was against the Irishman [[Tom Sharkey]]. The fight went the full twenty rounds and Sharkey was knocked down in the eleventh round. Jeffries won the decision.\n\nAfter defeating the big, fast-moving, sharp-jabbing [[Bob Armstrong (boxer)|Bob Armstrong]], Jeffries had earned the right to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn June 9, 1899 in [[Brooklyn, New York]] he defeated [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] by KO in the eleventh round to win the [[Heavyweight]] Championship of the World. That August, he embarked on a tour of [[Europe]], putting on exhibition fights for the fans. Jeffries was involved in several motion pictures recreating portions of his championship fights. Filmed portions of his other bouts and of some of his exhibition matches survive to this day.\n\n===World Heavyweight Champion===\nIn his first title defense, he won a twenty-five-round decision in a rematch over Tom Sharkey.\n\nJeffries set the record for the quickest KO in a Heavyweight title fight ever, which was 55 seconds against Jack Finnegan in his second title defense.\n\nHis next defense was against the former [[Heavyweight]] Champion and legendary technician, [[James J. Corbett]]. Corbett had put up a perfect defense and could have arguably won had the fight gone the distance. However, Corbett was knocked out cold from a left to the jaw in the twenty-third round of the scheduled twenty-five round fight.\n\nJeffries later got the chance to avenge his controversial draw with Gus Ruhlin when he defended his title against him on November 15, 1901. Claims that Ruhlin quit during the fifth round are incorrect. All of the local next-day San Francisco sources agree that Ruhlin's manager, Billy Madden, threw in the towel to retire Gus during the one-minute interval between the fifth and sixth rounds.\n\nAn example of Jeffries' ability to absorb punishment and recover from a severe battering to win a bout came in his rematch for the title with Fitzsimmons, who is regarded as one of the hardest punchers in boxing history. The rematch with Jeffries occurred on July 25, 1902 in [[San Francisco]]. To train for the bout Jeffries' daily training included a {{convert|14|mi|km|sing=on}} run, 2 hours of skipping rope, medicine ball training, 20 minutes sparring on the heavy bag, and at least 12 rounds of sparring in the ring. He also trained in wrestling.\n\nFor nearly eight rounds Fitzsimmons subjected Jeffries to a vicious battering. Jeffries suffered a broken nose, both his cheeks were cut to the bone, and gashes were opened over both eyes. It appeared that the fight would have to be stopped, as blood freely flowed into Jeffries' eyes. Then in the eighth round, Jeffries lashed out with a terrific right to the stomach, followed by a left hook to the jaw which knocked Fitzsimmons unconscious.\n\nJeffries and Corbett met one last time in the ring on August 14, 1903. This time Jeffries was in total control for all ten rounds of the scheduled twenty round bout. Tommy Ryan, Corbett's chief second, threw a large palm-leaf fan into the ring to alert Referee Graney that he should stop the fight.\n\nJeffries had his seventh and final title defense against Canadian Jack Munroe, whom he stopped in only two rounds.\n\nJeffries broke the ribs of three opponents in title fights: [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]], Gus Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Jeffries retired undefeated in May 1905. He served as a referee for the next few years, including the bout in which [[Marvin Hart]] defeated [[Jack Root]] to stake a claim at Jeffries' vacated title. Jeffries had never been knocked down in his prime.\n\nJeffries had likely fought many more bouts than twenty-two at this time. Many of his fights were lost in history. Jeffries, however, had never been defeated before his original retirement.\n\n===Comeback: \"The Fight of the Century\"===\n[[File:Johnson jeff.jpg|left|thumb|200px|James Jeffries during his fight with [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]]]\nOver five years after retiring, Jeffries made a comeback on July 4, 1910 at [[Reno, Nevada]] in a match against champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], who had won the [[Heavyweight]] Championship in 1908 by defeating Canadian champion [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]] at [[Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|Rushcutters Bay]] in Australia. Burns was the first heavyweight champion to fight African-American challengers.\n\nThe media put pressure onto Jeffries and promoters dangled wealth in front of him to take the fight. He finally acquiesced, saying \"I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a negro.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Zirin |first=Dave|year=2008 |title=\nPeople's History of Sports in the United States: 250 Years of Politics, Protest, People, and Play|publisher=The New Press|page=42|ISBN=1595581006}}</ref> In addition to a guaranteed purse of $40,000 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1910|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), to woo the ex-champ back into the ring, promoter [[Tex Rickard]] had signed him to a $75,000 personal contract.\n\nAfter a six-year lay-off, the 35-year-old Jeffries was out of shape and had lost most of his muscle. Jeffries weighed over 330 pounds (150&nbsp;kg), while Johnson was in superb physical condition. The ex-champ had to lose 110 pounds to get down to his fighting weight of 226, a Herculean task in the time he had before the fight. Previous Heavyweight Champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (an ethnic Irish American who refused to fight African-American contenders) remarked during an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Jeffries' personal doctor was so amazed at Johnson's physical condition that he felt Jeffries could win only if Johnson had a lack of skill on the day. While the media instigated racist remarks about winning the title for whites, Jeffries' final words before the fight were, \"It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible.\" His wife also commented, \"I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight.\"<ref>[http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/04/jack-johnson-jim-jeffries-highlighted-u-s-racial-divide/ \"Jack Johnson-Jim Jeffries Fight Highlighted the US Racial Divide\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193813/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/04/jack-johnson-jim-jeffries-highlighted-u-s-racial-divide/ |date=2012-03-02 }}, 4 July 2010, AOL News</ref>\n\n{{YouTube|L1y76L2P-IQ|Motion picture footage}} of Jeffries on the morning of the fight depicts a relaxed man playing with his dog. Ringside seats that had been priced at $50 were being scalped at $125 each (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125|1910|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). More than 1,000 spectators who were unable to get seats in the sold-out arena climbed over the walls to enter.\n\nBefore the fight, which was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, famous boxers who had traveled to Reno to witness the contest were introduced to the crowd, including [[Sam Langford]], a black boxer who was unable to secure a title fight, even from Jack Johnson. The greatest applause went to [[Jake Kilrain]], who had battled John L. Sullivan back in the bare-knuckle days.\n\nAt three minutes to one P.M., Johnson entered the ring (his contract provided that he would always be first to enter the ring, to satisfy a superstition of his). The thermometer read 110\u00b0 Fahrenheit, which meant the match would be even more brutal due to heat. Jeffries soon joined Johnson in the ring. Rickard served as referee. (Johnson and Jeffries could not agree on a referee, and Rickard's publicity-minded offers to President [[William Howard Taft]] and writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to serve as referee were declined. Rickard took the position although he had never refereed a prize fight before.)\n\nIn the first three rounds, the boxers sparred to feel each other out. Johnson, having read that no one could tie Jeffries up on the inside due to his power, told the press that not only would he do so, but that he planned to neutralize Jeffries' power by twisting his arms behind him. Toward the end of the fourth round, he did just that, pinning Jeffries' arms in back of him for a moment, but Jeffries broke the clinch. Johnson landed a solid overhand right to Jeffries' head just before the bell.\n\nJohnson began dominating the fight in rounds five through twelve, as his opponent faded in the heat and from Johnson's onslaught. The heat began to get to Johnson, too, by round 13, but he was still the stronger and younger man in the ring. Toward the end of that round, he delivered a right and a right uppercut to Jeffries' head that took their toll. In the next round, Jeffries eluded Johnson, who stalked him all over the ring.\n\nIn round 15, Johnson went after Jeffries and caught him against the ropes with a right upper-cut, followed by three left uppercuts that sent the ex-champ to the canvas for the first time in his career. He could no longer put up a defense and, as Jeffries got up, Johnson hit him with a left hook that sent him to the canvas and through the ropes, putting his torso outside the ring. Helped to his feet by one of his seconds and a fan, as soon as Jeffries was back in the ring he was rushed by Johnson, who knocked him down again with a right to the head. As Rickard moved in to separate the fighters, Jeffries got up, but his manager had entered the ring to stop the fight and save his fighter from being knocked out. Johnson retained the title by a [[technical knockout]].\n\nJohnson later remarked that he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut to Jeffries' face and saw the look in his eyes. \"I knew what that look meant,\" he said. \"The old ship was sinking.\" [[John L. Sullivan]] commented for ''[[The New York Times]]'' after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly, and convincingly:\n\n{{quote|The fight of the century is over and a black man is the undisputed champion of the world. It was a poor fight as fights go, this less than 15-round affair between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Scarcely has there ever been a championship contest that was so one-sided. All of Jeffries much-vaunted condition amounted to nothing. He wasn't in it from the first bell tap to the last \u2026. The negro had few friends, but there was little demonstration against him. (Spectators) could not help but admire Johnson because he is the type of prizefighter that is admired by sportsmen. He played fairly at all times and fought fairly. \u2026 What a crafty, powerful, cunning left hand (Johnson) has. He is one of the craftiest, cunningest boxers that ever stepped into the ring. \u2026 They both fought closely all during the 15 rounds. It was just the sort of fight that Jeffries wanted. There was no running or ducking like Corbett did with me in New Orleans (1892). Jeffries did not miss so many blows, because he hardly started any. Johnson was on top of him all the time.... (Johnson) didn't get gay at all with Jeffries in the beginning, and it was always the white man who clinched, but Johnson was very careful, and he backed away and took no chances, and was good-natured with it all. \u2026 The best man won, and I was one of the first to congratulate him, and also one of the first to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the beaten man.<ref>John L. Sullivan, cited in: Christopher James Shelton, [http://www.ringsideboxingshow.com/SheltonBLOGJohnsonJeffries.html \"'Fight of the Century' Johnson vs. Jeffries, the 100th anniversary\"], Ringside Boxing Show</ref>}}\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn his later years, Jeffries trained boxers and worked as a fight promoter. He promoted many fights out of a structure known as \"Jeffries Barn\", which was located on his alfalfa ranch at the southwest corner of Victory Boulevard and Buena Vista, Burbank, California. (His ranch house was on the southeast corner until the early 1960s.) Jeffries Barn is now part of [[Knott's Berry Farm]], a [[Southern California]] amusement park. \n\nSeven years after suffering a stroke, Jeffries died on March 3, 1953, in bed at his home with his neice Lillian Bull. Bull had been living with Jeffries as his housekeeper and he had instructed her to call a doctor. Jeffries died before the doctor arrived. The doctor, William M. Nethery, attributed his death to a [[heart attack]] caused by [[coronary thrombosis]].<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19530304&id=7DBdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EVsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4372,1685873&hl=en</ref> His body was interred in the [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]] in [[Inglewood, California]].\n\n==Legacy==\nToday, the legacy of Jeffries is widely forgotten. However, he was once considered one of the greatest Heavyweight Champions of all time by many fellow boxers and boxing experts:<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtOjXb3EsW4|title=How Does Jim Jeffries Rank?|date=2 October 2006|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI8mVLPbvLw|title=How Good Was Jim Jeffries?|date=3 October 2006|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n*[[Jack Root]], [[Willie Ritchie]] and [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]], former Light Heavyweight, Lightweight and Heavyweight Champions, respectively, rated Jeffries as the greatest heavyweight.\n*[[James J. Corbett]] said of Jeffries, \"The thing the always impressed me was the speed the youngster had, and he weighed two-hundred-twenty-five pounds. I hold that Jeffries was the greatest Heavyweight Champion of them all.\"\n\n*[[Sam Langford]], the great fighter who fought from lightweight to heavyweight, advertised to fight any man in the world, except Jim Jeffries.\n\n*[[Tom Sharkey]], heavyweight top contender, thought that Jeffries would have beaten [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Joe Louis]] on the same night. He said Jeffries was strong like a bull and quick on his feet like a cat. Sharkey called Jeffries the greatest fighter of all time.\n\n*[[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], the only man to beat Jeffries, stated in an interview with Ring Magazine that he thought Jeffries was the greatest. In another interview, Johnson said Jeffries would beat both Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis.  However, in turn, Jeffries said after their bout: \"I could never have whipped Johnson at my best. I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years.\" <ref name=\"biography.com\">{{cite web|title=Jack Johnson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-johnson-9355980|accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n \n*Jack Dempsey, the great Heavyweight Champion, once said: \"Jim Jeffries was a tough gun. If we could have gotten in the ring together, each at our best... I probably would have had my chin knocked off.\"\n\n*[[William A. Brady|William Brady]], who managed both Jim Jeffries and Jim Corbett, remarked about Jeffries: \"There was never a man fitted anatomically, physically, and temperamentally for the role of World's Heavyweight Champion.\"\n\n*[[Nat Fleischer]], founder of Ring Magazine and The Ring Record book, described Jeffries: \"One of the most formidable fighting machines the prize ring ever produced.\"\n\n*[[Dan Morgan]], fight manager for forty years, who saw them all, rated Jeffries as the all-time best. Morgan called Jeffries a \"Champion of Champions.\"\n\n*[[Tex Rickard]], famed sportsman and promoter, held the view: \"Big Jim will always live in my memory as the greatest heavyweight boxer of his time. While he reigned supreme, he gave all a chance. He did not know the meaning of the word fear.\"\n\n*W. W. Naughton, sports writer of the day, records: \"To sum up his qualities of ringsmanship, it may be said he is fairly talented in every branch of self-defense. He boxes cleverly, defends himself well, and strikes a hard blow. But back of all these are the qualities which have made him a champion, magnificent strength and wonderful endurance.\"\n\n*Dewitt Van Court, boxing instructor and athletic director of the [[Los Angeles]] Athletic Club wrote: \"I was with James J. Jeffries when he first started to box. I was with him when he won the Championship. I was with him when he lost it. Besides being the greatest Heavyweight Champion that ever lived, he is today and has been all his life, a man among men, a true friend with a heart as big as his body.\"\n\nThe city of Burbank embedded a small bronze plaque in the sidewalk at the site where James Jeffries died. The plaque was located on the southeast side of Buena Vista ~150 yards south of Victory Boulevard, before being stored at Burbank City Hall, and now is located at the Gordon R. Howard Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-me-community-20180604-story.html|title=Community: New exhibit piece at Burbank museum is a real knockout|last=Rudolph|first=Joyce|website=latimes.com|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nJames J.

They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan's Music Store. Here, a young [[Jerry Garcia]], oblivious to the date, was waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. [[The Beatles]] significantly influenced their musical direction. \"The Beatles were why we turned from a [[jug band]] into a rock 'n' roll band,\" said Bob Weir. \"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\"<ref>Jackson, Blair (2000). ''Garcia: An American Life'', p. 67</ref> Originally called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, the band was later renamed The Warlocks and eventually the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\n[[File:Bob Weir 1975.jpg|thumb|left|Weir performing with [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]], in 1975. Photo: [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]]]]\nWeir played [[rhythm guitar]] and sang a large portion of the [[lead vocals]] through all of the Dead's 30-year career. In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]]. These shows, with the band billed as \"Mickey and the Hartbeats\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, \"Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band\u2026  Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby's guitar playing.\"<ref>Jackson, Blair (2000). ''Garcia: An American Life'', p. 155</ref> Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full-time.<ref>McNally, p. 279, 284</ref><ref>Scott, John W. et al. (1999). ''DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists'', DeadBase, {{ISBN|1-877657-22-0}}, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir's guitar playing.  Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir's playing more clearly than ever and \"I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.\" Lesh described Weir's playing as \"quirky, whimsical and goofy\" and noted his ability to play chord [[Voicing (music)|voicings]] on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).<ref>''Searching for the Sound'', Phil Lesh</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with [[slide guitar]] techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist [[McCoy Tyner]] and he has cited artists as diverse as [[John Coltrane]], the [[Reverend Gary Davis|Rev. Gary Davis]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]] as influences.<ref name=multiple />\n\nWeir's first solo album ''[[Ace (Bob Weir album)|Ace]]'' appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were [[Keith Godchaux]] and his wife [[Donna Godchaux|Donna]], both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release. A live version of the album's best-known song, \"Playing in the Band\", had been issued on the [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Skull & Roses'' album]] of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976 Weir played in the Bay Area band [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]] with friends [[Matthew Kelly (musician)|Matt Kelly]] and [[Dave Torbert]]. He later contributed to Kelly's 1987 album ''A Wing and a Prayer'', on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with [[Brent Mydland]], who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band, [[Bobby and the Midnites]].\n\nShortly before Garcia's death in 1995, Weir formed another band, RatDog Revue, later shortened to [[RatDog]]. In RatDog, Weir performs covers of songs by various artists, including [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Willie Dixon]] while also performing many Grateful Dead songs. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album ''[[Evening Moods]]''. \n[[File:Bob Weir Jay Lane RatDog 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Weir and [[Jay Lane]] on stage with [[RatDog]] in 2009.]]\n\nWeir has participated in the various [[Reunions of the Grateful Dead|reformations of the Grateful Dead's members]], including 1998, 2000, and 2002 stints as [[The Other Ones]] and in 2003, 2004 and 2009 as [[The Dead (band)|The Dead]]. In 2008 he performed in the two [[Deadheads for Obama]] concerts. In 2009 Bob Weir and [[Phil Lesh]] formed a new band called [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]]\u2014so-named in honor of [[Ken Kesey]]'s famous psychedelically-painted bus.\n\nIn 2011, Weir founded the [[Tamalpais Research Institute]], also known as TRI Studios.

They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan's Music Store. Here, a young [[Jerry Garcia]], oblivious to the date, was waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. [[The Beatles]] significantly influenced their musical direction. \"The Beatles were why we turned from a [[jug band]] into a rock 'n' roll band,\" said Bob Weir. \"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\"<ref>Jackson, Blair (2000). ''Garcia: An American Life'', p. 67</ref> Originally called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, the band was later renamed The Warlocks and eventually the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\n[[File:Bob Weir 1975.jpg|thumb|left|Weir performing with [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]], in 1975. Photo: [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]]]]\nWeir played [[rhythm guitar]] and sang a large portion of the [[lead vocals]] through all of the Dead's 30-year career. In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]]. These shows, with the band billed as \"Mickey and the Hartbeats\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, \"Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band\u2026  Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby's guitar playing.\"<ref>Jackson, Blair (2000). ''Garcia: An American Life'', p. 155</ref> Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full-time.<ref>McNally, p. 279, 284</ref><ref>Scott, John W. et al. (1999). ''DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists'', DeadBase, {{ISBN|1-877657-22-0}}, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir's guitar playing.  Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir's playing more clearly than ever and \"I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.\" Lesh described Weir's playing as \"quirky, whimsical and goofy\" and noted his ability to play chord [[Voicing (music)|voicings]] on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).<ref>''Searching for the Sound'', Phil Lesh</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with [[slide guitar]] techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist [[McCoy Tyner]] and he has cited artists as diverse as [[John Coltrane]], the [[Reverend Gary Davis|Rev. Gary Davis]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]] as influences.<ref name=multiple />\n\nWeir's first solo album ''[[Ace (Bob Weir album)|Ace]]'' appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were [[Keith Godchaux]] and his wife [[Donna Godchaux|Donna]], both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release. A live version of the album's best-known song, \"Playing in the Band\", had been issued on the [[Grateful Dead (album)|''Skull & Roses'' album]] of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976 Weir played in the Bay Area band [[Kingfish (band)|Kingfish]] with friends [[Matthew Kelly (musician)|Matt Kelly]] and [[Dave Torbert]]. He later contributed to Kelly's 1987 album ''A Wing and a Prayer'', on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with [[Brent Mydland]], who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band, [[Bobby and the Midnites]].\n\nShortly before Garcia's death in 1995, Weir formed another band, RatDog Revue, later shortened to [[RatDog]]. In RatDog, Weir performs covers of songs by various artists, including [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Willie Dixon]] while also performing many Grateful Dead songs. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album ''[[Evening Moods]]''. \n[[File:Bob Weir Jay Lane RatDog 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Weir and [[Jay Lane]] on stage with [[RatDog]] in 2009.]]\n\nWeir has participated in the various [[Reunions of the Grateful Dead|reformations of the Grateful Dead's members]], including 1998, 2000, and 2002 stints as [[The Other Ones]] and in 2003, 2004 and 2009 as [[The Dead (band)|The Dead]]. In 2008 he performed in the two [[Deadheads for Obama]] concerts.
