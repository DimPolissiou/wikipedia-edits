After the [[Anglo Maratha Wars]] 19th century, the region was divided into several [[princely states]] under the [[British Empire|British]] and incorporated into [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[Central India Agency]]. After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with [[Nagpur]] as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was [[States Reorganisation Act|reorganised]] and its parts were combined with the states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Bhopal State (1949\u201356)|Bhopal]] to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking [[Vidarbha]] region was removed and merged with the then [[Bombay State]]. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern [[Chhattisgarh]] region was made as a separate state.\n\nThe [[economy of Madhya Pradesh]] is the [[List of Indian states by GDP|tenth-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|8.09|lc}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|90|k}}.<ref name=\"MOSPI\"/> Madhya Pradesh ranks [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|32nd]] among Indian states in [[human development index]].<ref name=\"snhdi-gdl\" /> Rich in mineral resources, MP has the largest reserves of diamond and copper in India.

It served as the capital of the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti kingdom]] Tejas. Other kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics\u2014[[Malava Kingdom|Malava]], [[Karusha Kingdom|Karusha]], [[Dasarna Kingdom|Dasarna]] and [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishada]]\u2014have also been identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.\n\n[[Chandragupta Maurya]] united northern India around 320 BCE, establishing the [[Mauryan Empire]], which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. [[Ashoka]] the greatest of Mauryan rulers brought the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the [[Saka]]s, the [[Kushana]]s, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra erected the [[Heliodorus pillar]] near Vidisha.\n\nUjjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century BCE, located on the trade routes between the [[Ganges]] plain and India's [[Arabian Sea]] ports. The [[Satavahana]] dynasty of the northern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and the Saka dynasty of the [[Western Satraps]] fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.\n\nThe [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] king [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] inflicted a crushing defeat upon the [[Saka]] rulers and conquered parts of Malwa and Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.<ref>''Ancient India'' by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar: p.134</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the region came under the control of the [[Gupta empire]] in the 4th and 5th centuries, and their southern neighbours, the [[Vakataka]]'s. The rock-cut temples at [[Bagh Caves]] in the Kukshi tehsil of the Dhar district attest to the presence of the Gupta dynasty in the region, supported by the testimony of a Badwani inscription dated to the year of 487 CE.<ref>Verma, Archana (2007). ''Cultural and Visual Flux at Early Historical Bagh in Central India'', Oxford: Archaeopress, {{ISBN|978-1-4073-0151-8}}, p.19</ref> The attacks of the [[Hephthalite]]s or White Huns brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, which broke up into smaller states. The king [[Yasodharman]] of [[Malwa]] defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. Later, [[Harsha]] (c. 590\u2013647) ruled the northern parts of the [[States and union territories of India|state]]. Malwa was ruled by the south Indian [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] from the late 8th century to the 10th century.<ref>''A Journey through India's Past (Great Hindu Kings after Harshavardhana)'', by Chandra Mauli Mani: p.13</ref> When the south Indian Emperor [[Govinda III]] of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] annexed Malwa, he set up the family of one of his subordinates there, who took the name of [[Paramara]].<ref>''A Brief History of India'' by Alain Dani\u00e9lou p.185</ref>\n\nThe Medieval period saw the rise of the [[Rajput]] clans, including the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] of Malwa and the [[Chandela]]s of [[Bundelkhand]]. The Chandellas built the majestic Hindu-Jain temples at [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]], which represent the culmination of Hindu temple architecture in Central India. The [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty]] also held sway in northern and western Madhya Pradesh at this time. It also left some monuments of architectural value in Gwalior. Southern parts of Madhya Pradesh like Malwa were several times invaded by the south Indian [[Western Chalukya Empire]] which imposed its rule on the Paramara kingdom of Malwa.<ref>''History of India'' by N. Jayapalan p.149\u2013151</ref> The Paramara king [[Bhoja]] (c. 1010\u20131060) was a renowned [[polymath]]. The small Gond kingdoms emerged in the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]] and [[Mahakoshal]] regions of the state. Northern Madhya Pradesh was conquered by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century. After the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of the 14th century, independent regional kingdoms re-emerged, including the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomara]] kingdom of [[Gwalior]] and the Muslim Sultanate of [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa]], with its capital at [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]].\n\nThe Malwa Sultanate was conquered by the Sultanate of [[Gujarat]] in 1531. In the 1540s, most parts of the state fell to [[Sher Shah Suri]], and subsequently to the Hindu king [[Hemu]]. Hemu, who had earlier served as the General of the Suri dynasty, operated from the [[Gwalior Fort]] during 1553\u201356 and became the ruler of Delhi as a Vikramaditya king winning 22 battles continuously from Bengal to Gujrat and defeating Akbar's forces in the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad|Battle of Delhi]] on 7 October 1556. However, he chose Delhi as his capital after his formal Coronation and left Gwalior. After Hemu's defeat by [[Akbar]] at the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] in 1556, most of Madhya Pradesh came under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged Mughal supremacy but enjoyed virtual autonomy.\n\nThe Mughal control weakened considerably after the death of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707. Between 1720 and 1760, the [[Marathas]] took control of most of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the establishment of semi-autonomous states under the nominal control of the [[Peshwa]] of [[Pune]]: the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]] ruled much of Malwa, [[Puars]] ruled [[Dewas State (Maratha Confederacy)|Dewas]] and [[Dhar State|Dhar]], the [[Bhonsle]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] dominated Mahakoshal-Gondwana area, while the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] controlled the northern parts of the state. The most notable Maratha rulers of the region were [[Mahadji Shinde]], [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] and [[Yashwantrao Holkar]]. Besides these, there were several other [[:Category:Princely states of Madhya Pradesh|small states]], including [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]], [[Orchha State|Orchha]], and [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. The Bhopal state, which paid tribute to both the Marathas and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], was founded by [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammed Khan]], a former General in the Mughal army.\n\nAfter the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], the [[British Empire|British]] took control of the entire region. All the sovereign states in the region became [[princely state]]s of [[British India]], governed by the [[Central India Agency]]. The Mahakoshal region became a British province: the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]]. In 1861, the British merged the [[Nagpur Province]] with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the [[Central Provinces]].\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 uprising]], rebellions happened in the northern parts of the state, led by leaders like [[Tatya Tope]]. However, these were crushed by the British and the princes loyal to them. The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref name=\"DwarkaPrasad1956\">{{cite book |editor=Dwarka Prasad Misha |title=The History of freedom movement in Madhya Pradesh |year=1956 |publisher=Govt.

Ambedkar]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]], [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Arjun Singh (former politician)|Arjun Singh]] were born in what is now Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAfter the independence of India, Madhya Pradesh was created in 1950 from the former British [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[princely states]] of [[Makrai]] and Chhattisgarh, with [[Nagpur]] as the capital of the state. The new states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and [[Bhopal State (1949\u201356)|Bhopal]] were formed out of the Central India Agency. In 1956, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh, and the [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking southern region [[Vidarbha]], which included Nagpur, was ceded to [[Bombay state]]. [[Jabalpur]] was chosen to be the capital of the state but at the last moment, due to some political pressure, [[Bhopal]] was made the state capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/|title=\u091c\u092c\u0932\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0925 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0938 \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u090f \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u0917\u0908 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0932 \u0926\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0940|website=Patrika.com|access-date=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083131/https://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2000, as part of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act, the southeastern portion of the state split off to form the new state of [[Chhattisgarh]].\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Rock painting, Bhimbetka, Raisen district, MP.jpg|Mesolithic rock painting, [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nFile:Khajuraho - Kandariya Mahadeo Temple.jpg|[[Kandariya Mahadeva Temple]], [[Khajuraho (town)|Khajuraho]]\nFile:Bateswar (6).JPG|[[Bateshwar Hindu temples, Madhya Pradesh|Bateshwar temple complex]], Padavli, Morena\nFile:Chausath Yogini Temple, Mitavli, Morena.jpg|Chausath Yogini Temple, Mitavli, Morena\nFile:262 Gwalior.jpg|[[Sahastra Bahu Temples]], [[Gwalior Fort]]\nFile:Teli Ka Mandir, Gwalior.jpg|[[Teli ka Mandir]], Gwalior Fort\nFile:Shiva Temple, Bhojpur 01.jpg|Shiva Temple in [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]]\nFile:Lakshmi Temple, Orchha.jpg|Lakshmi Temple, [[Orchha]]\nFile:A Hindu temple, Amarkantak Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|Brahma statue with various deities at [[Amarkantak]].\nFile:Gorgeous Gwalior Fort.jpg|[[Gwalior Fort]], Gwalior\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location in India ===\nMadhya Pradesh literally means \"Central Province\", and is located in the geographic heart of India in between the latitude of 21.6\u00b0N-26.30\u00b0N and longitude of 74\u00b09'E-82\u00b048'E.

It flows westward through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern. Its tributaries include the Banjar, the [[Tawa River|Tawa]], the [[Machna]], the [[Shakkar River|Shakkar]], the [[Denwa]] and the [[Sonbhadra]] rivers. The [[Tapti River]] runs parallel to Narmada, and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmada\u2013Tapti systems carry an enormous volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source of water and acts as a lifeline to the state.\n\nThe [[Vindhyas]] form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the western part of the Ganges basin draining into the [[Yamuna]] and the eastern part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Shipra River|Shipra]], [[Kali Sindh River|Kali Sindh]], [[Parbati River (Madhya Pradesh)|Parbati]], [[Kuno River|Kuno]], [[Sind River|Sind]], [[Betwa River|Betwa]], [[Dhasan River|Dhasan]] and [[Ken River|Ken]] rivers being the main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the [[Ujjain Simhastha|Simhastha Kumbh Mela]], which is held every 12 years. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich, with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and [[dry deciduous forest]] types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the [[Son River|Son]], the [[Tons River|Tons]] and the [[Rihand]] Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills around [[Amarkantak]], is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on the south bank and that does not arise from the [[Himalayas]]. Son and its tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAfter the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of [[Mahanadi]] basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe [[Satpura]]s, in the [[Gawilgarh]] and [[Mahadeo Hills]], also contain a watershed, which is south facing. The [[Wainganga River|Wainganga]], the [[Wardha River|Wardha]], the Pench, the [[Kanhan River|Kanhan]] rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] river system. The Godavari basin consists of [[sub-tropical]], semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the Indrawati. There are many important multi-state irrigation projects in development, including the [[Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects]].\n\n=== Regions ===\nMadhya Pradesh is divided into the following agro-climatic zones:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kaimur Range|Kaimur]] Plateau and [[Satpura]] Hills\n* [[Vindhya]]n Plateau (Hills)\n* [[Narmada River|Narmada]] valley\n* [[Wainganga]] valley\n* [[Gird, India|Gird]] ([[Gwalior]]) Region\n* [[Bundelkhand]] Region\n* [[Satpura]] Plateau (Hills)\n* [[Malwa]] Plateau\n* [[Nimar]] Plateau\n* [[Jhabua]] Hills\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Administratation ===\nMadhya Pradesh is administratively divided into 10 divisions and further 52 districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mponline.gov.in/Portal/Content/mpprofile.aspx?langid=hi-in|title=MPOnline: Contact Government|website=Mponline.gov.in|accessdate=26 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802102010/http://www.mponline.gov.in/Portal/Content/mpprofile.aspx?langid=hi-in|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bhopal Division]]\n* [[Chambal Division]]\n* [[Gwalior Division]]\n* [[Indore Division]]\n* [[Jabalpur Division]]\n* [[Narmadapuram Division]]\n* [[Rewa Division]]\n* [[Sagar Division]]\n* [[Shahdol Division]]\n* [[Ujjain Division]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==== Cities ====\n{{Main|List of cities in Madhya Pradesh by population}}\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities of Madhya Pradesh\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Madhya Pradesh\n| stat_ref    = As of the [[List of cities in Madhya Pradesh by population|2011 Census]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_3_PR_UA_Citiees_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf | title = Urban Agglomerations/Cities having population 1 lakh and above | work = Provisional Population Totals, Census of India 2011 | accessdate = 13 February 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111113152754/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_3_PR_UA_Citiees_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf | archive-date = 13 November 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n| list_by_pop = Largest cities\n| div_name    = District\n| div_link    = List of districts of Madhya Pradesh{{!}}District\n\n| city_1 = Indore\n| div_1  = Indore district{{!}}Indore\n| pop_1  = 2,167,447\n| img_1  = Indore Rajwada01.jpg\n\n| city_2 = Bhopal\n| div_2  = Bhopal district{{!}}Bhopal\n| pop_2  = 1,883,381\n| img_2  = Bhopal city.jpg\n\n| city_3 = Jabalpur\n| div_3  = Jabalpur district{{!}}Jabalpur\n| pop_3  = 1,267,564\n| img_3  = ShivStatueAtKachnarCityJabalpur.JPG\n\n| city_4 = Gwalior\n| div_4  = Gwalior district{{!}}Gwalior\n| pop_4  = 1,101,981\n| img_4  = Gwalior fort - panoramio - Gyanendrasinghchauha\u2026 (12).jpg\n\n| city_5 = Ujjain\n| div_5  = Ujjain district{{!}}Ujjain\n| pop_5  = 593,368\n\n| city_6 = Sagar, Madhya Pradesh{{!}}Sagar\n| div_6  = Sagar district{{!}}Sagar\n| pop_6  = 370,296\n\n| city_7 = Dewas\n| div_7  = Dewas district{{!}}Dewas\n| pop_7  = 289,438\n\n| city_8 = Satna\n| div_8  = Satna district{{!}}Satna\n| pop_8  = 283,004\n\n| city_9 = Ratlam\n| div_9  = Ratlam district{{!}}Ratlam\n| pop_9  = 273,892\n\n| city_10 = Rewa, Madhya Pradesh{{!}}Rewa\n| div_10  = Rewa district{{!}}Rewa\n| pop_10  = 235,422\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n===My Indian news ===\n{{My Indian news\n| title=Earnings on support price of Rabi crops in Madhya Pradesh from April 15\n| 1951= 18615000\n| 1961= 23218000\n| 1971= 30017000\n| 1981= 38169000\n| 1991= 48566000\n| 2001= 60348000\n| 2011= 72597565\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"jitendra kushwah\">{{cite web|url=https://www.myindiannews.com/2020/04/earnings-on-support-price-of-rabi-crops.html|title=Earnings on support price of Rabi crops in Madhya Pradesh from April 15|work=Census of India|publisher=My indian news|accessdate=12 Apr 2020|archive-url=https://www.myindiannews.com/2020/04/earnings-on-support-price-of-rabi-crops.html/https://www.myindiannews.com/2020/04/earnings-on-support-price-of-rabi-crops.html|archive-date=12 Apr 2020|url-status=}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe population of Madhya Pradesh consists of a number of [[ethnic group]]s and [[tribe]]s, [[caste]]s and communities, including the indigenous tribals and relatively more recent migrants from other states. The [[scheduled castes]] and the [[scheduled tribes]] constitute a significant portion of the [[population]] of the State. The main tribal groups in Madhya Pradesh are [[Gondi people|Gond]], [[Bhil]], [[Baiga (tribe)|Baiga]], [[Korku people|Korku]], [[Bharia people|Bhadia]] (or Bhariya), Halba, [[Kaul]], [[Madia Gond|Mariya]], [[Malto people|Malto]] and [[Sahariya]]. [[Dhar]], [[Jhabua]] and [[Mandla]] districts have more than 50 percent tribal population. In [[Khargone]], [[Chhindwara district|Chhindwara]], [[Seoni district|Seoni]], [[Sidhi]], [[Singrauli]] and [[Shahdol]] districts 30\u201350 percent population is of tribes. According to the 2011 census, the [[adivasi]] population in Madhya Pradesh was 15.34 million, constituting 21.1% of the total population. There were 46 recognised Scheduled Tribes and three of them have been identified as \"Special Primitive Tribal Groups\" in the State.<ref>[http://www.mp_gov_in_sc_st_welfare_2001/tribal/]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nDue to the different linguistic, cultural and geographical environment, and its peculiar complications, the diverse tribal world of Madhya Pradesh has been largely cut off from mainstream development.

It borders the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] to the northeast, [[Chhattisgarh]] to the southeast, [[Maharashtra]] to the south, [[Gujarat]] to the west, and [[Rajasthan]] to the northwest.<ref>http://fsi.nic.in/cover_2011/madhyapradesh.pdf</ref> Before 2000, when Chhattisgarh was a part of Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh was the largest state in India and the distance between the two furthest points inside the state, [[Singoli]] and [[Konta]], was 1500&nbsp;km.\n\nThe area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] [[Mahajanapada]], whose capital [[Ujjain]] (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. [[Maratha empire]] dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the [[Anglo Maratha Wars]] 19th century, the region was divided into several [[princely states]] under the [[British Empire|British]] and incorporated into [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[Central India Agency]]. After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with [[Nagpur]] as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was [[States Reorganisation Act|reorganised]] and its parts were combined with the states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Bhopal State (1949\u201356)|Bhopal]] to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking [[Vidarbha]] region was removed and merged with the then [[Bombay State]]. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern [[Chhattisgarh]] region was made as a separate state.\n\nThe [[economy of Madhya Pradesh]] is the [[List of Indian states by GDP|tenth-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|8.09|lc}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|90|k}}.<ref name=\"MOSPI\"/> Madhya Pradesh ranks [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|32nd]] among Indian states in [[human development index]].<ref name=\"snhdi-gdl\" /> Rich in mineral resources, MP has the largest reserves of diamond and copper in India.

It served as the capital of the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti kingdom]] Tejas. Other kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics\u2014[[Malava Kingdom|Malava]], [[Karusha Kingdom|Karusha]], [[Dasarna Kingdom|Dasarna]] and [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishada]]\u2014have also been identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.\n\n[[Chandragupta Maurya]] united northern India around 320 BCE, establishing the [[Mauryan Empire]], which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. [[Ashoka]] the greatest of Mauryan rulers brought the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the [[Saka]]s, the [[Kushana]]s, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra erected the [[Heliodorus pillar]] near Vidisha.\n\nUjjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century BCE, located on the trade routes between the [[Ganges]] plain and India's [[Arabian Sea]] ports. The [[Satavahana]] dynasty of the northern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and the Saka dynasty of the [[Western Satraps]] fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.\n\nThe [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] king [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] inflicted a crushing defeat upon the [[Saka]] rulers and conquered parts of Malwa and Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.<ref>''Ancient India'' by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar: p.134</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the region came under the control of the [[Gupta empire]] in the 4th and 5th centuries, and their southern neighbours, the [[Vakataka]]'s. The rock-cut temples at [[Bagh Caves]] in the Kukshi tehsil of the Dhar district attest to the presence of the Gupta dynasty in the region, supported by the testimony of a Badwani inscription dated to the year of 487 CE.<ref>Verma, Archana (2007). ''Cultural and Visual Flux at Early Historical Bagh in Central India'', Oxford: Archaeopress, {{ISBN|978-1-4073-0151-8}}, p.19</ref> The attacks of the [[Hephthalite]]s or White Huns brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, which broke up into smaller states. The king [[Yasodharman]] of [[Malwa]] defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. Later, [[Harsha]] (c. 590\u2013647) ruled the northern parts of the [[States and union territories of India|state]]. Malwa was ruled by the south Indian [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] from the late 8th century to the 10th century.<ref>''A Journey through India's Past (Great Hindu Kings after Harshavardhana)'', by Chandra Mauli Mani: p.13</ref> When the south Indian Emperor [[Govinda III]] of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] annexed Malwa, he set up the family of one of his subordinates there, who took the name of [[Paramara]].<ref>''A Brief History of India'' by Alain Dani\u00e9lou p.185</ref>\n\nThe Medieval period saw the rise of the [[Rajput]] clans, including the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] of Malwa and the [[Chandela]]s of [[Bundelkhand]]. The Chandellas built the majestic Hindu-Jain temples at [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]], which represent the culmination of Hindu temple architecture in Central India. The [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty]] also held sway in northern and western Madhya Pradesh at this time. It also left some monuments of architectural value in Gwalior. Southern parts of Madhya Pradesh like Malwa were several times invaded by the south Indian [[Western Chalukya Empire]] which imposed its rule on the Paramara kingdom of Malwa.<ref>''History of India'' by N. Jayapalan p.149\u2013151</ref> The Paramara king [[Bhoja]] (c. 1010\u20131060) was a renowned [[polymath]]. The small Gond kingdoms emerged in the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]] and [[Mahakoshal]] regions of the state. Northern Madhya Pradesh was conquered by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century. After the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of the 14th century, independent regional kingdoms re-emerged, including the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomara]] kingdom of [[Gwalior]] and the Muslim Sultanate of [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa]], with its capital at [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]].\n\nThe Malwa Sultanate was conquered by the Sultanate of [[Gujarat]] in 1531. In the 1540s, most parts of the state fell to [[Sher Shah Suri]], and subsequently to the Hindu king [[Hemu]]. Hemu, who had earlier served as the General of the Suri dynasty, operated from the [[Gwalior Fort]] during 1553\u201356 and became the ruler of Delhi as a Vikramaditya king winning 22 battles continuously from Bengal to Gujrat and defeating Akbar's forces in the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad|Battle of Delhi]] on 7 October 1556. However, he chose Delhi as his capital after his formal Coronation and left Gwalior. After Hemu's defeat by [[Akbar]] at the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] in 1556, most of Madhya Pradesh came under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged Mughal supremacy but enjoyed virtual autonomy.\n\nThe Mughal control weakened considerably after the death of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707. Between 1720 and 1760, the [[Marathas]] took control of most of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the establishment of semi-autonomous states under the nominal control of the [[Peshwa]] of [[Pune]]: the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]] ruled much of Malwa, [[Puars]] ruled [[Dewas State (Maratha Confederacy)|Dewas]] and [[Dhar State|Dhar]], the [[Bhonsle]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] dominated Mahakoshal-Gondwana area, while the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] controlled the northern parts of the state. The most notable Maratha rulers of the region were [[Mahadji Shinde]], [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] and [[Yashwantrao Holkar]]. Besides these, there were several other [[:Category:Princely states of Madhya Pradesh|small states]], including [[Bhopal State|Bhopal]], [[Orchha State|Orchha]], and [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. The Bhopal state, which paid tribute to both the Marathas and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], was founded by [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammed Khan]], a former General in the Mughal army.\n\nAfter the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], the [[British Empire|British]] took control of the entire region. All the sovereign states in the region became [[princely state]]s of [[British India]], governed by the [[Central India Agency]]. The Mahakoshal region became a British province: the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]]. In 1861, the British merged the [[Nagpur Province]] with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the [[Central Provinces]].\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 uprising]], rebellions happened in the northern parts of the state, led by leaders like [[Tatya Tope]]. However, these were crushed by the British and the princes loyal to them. The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref name=\"DwarkaPrasad1956\">{{cite book |editor=Dwarka Prasad Misha |title=The History of freedom movement in Madhya Pradesh |year=1956 |publisher=Govt.

Ambedkar]], [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]], [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Arjun Singh (former politician)|Arjun Singh]] were born in what is now Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAfter the independence of India, Madhya Pradesh was created in 1950 from the former British [[Central Provinces and Berar]] and the [[princely states]] of [[Makrai]] and Chhattisgarh, with [[Nagpur]] as the capital of the state. The new states of [[Madhya Bharat]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and [[Bhopal State (1949\u201356)|Bhopal]] were formed out of the Central India Agency. In 1956, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh, and the [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking southern region [[Vidarbha]], which included Nagpur, was ceded to [[Bombay state]]. [[Jabalpur]] was chosen to be the capital of the state but at the last moment, due to some political pressure, [[Bhopal]] was made the state capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/|title=\u091c\u092c\u0932\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0925 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0938 \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u090f \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u0917\u0908 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0932 \u0926\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0940|website=Patrika.com|access-date=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083131/https://www.patrika.com/news/madhya-pradesh/that-s-why-jabalpur-could-not-make-capital-of-mp-3323/|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2000, as part of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act, the southeastern portion of the state split off to form the new state of [[Chhattisgarh]].\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Rock painting, Bhimbetka, Raisen district, MP.jpg|Mesolithic rock painting, [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nFile:Khajuraho - Kandariya Mahadeo Temple.jpg|[[Kandariya Mahadeva Temple]], [[Khajuraho (town)|Khajuraho]]\nFile:Bateswar (6).JPG|[[Bateshwar Hindu temples, Madhya Pradesh|Bateshwar temple complex]], Padavli, Morena\nFile:Chausath Yogini Temple, Mitavli, Morena.jpg|Chausath Yogini Temple, Mitavli, Morena\nFile:262 Gwalior.jpg|[[Sahastra Bahu Temples]], [[Gwalior Fort]]\nFile:Teli Ka Mandir, Gwalior.jpg|[[Teli ka Mandir]], Gwalior Fort\nFile:Shiva Temple, Bhojpur 01.jpg|Shiva Temple in [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]]\nFile:Lakshmi Temple, Orchha.jpg|Lakshmi Temple, [[Orchha]]\nFile:A Hindu temple, Amarkantak Madhya Pradesh India.jpg|Brahma statue with various deities at [[Amarkantak]].\nFile:Gorgeous Gwalior Fort.jpg|[[Gwalior Fort]], Gwalior\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location in India ===\nMadhya Pradesh literally means \"Central Province\", and is located in the geographic heart of India in between the latitude of 21.6\u00b0N-26.30\u00b0N and longitude of 74\u00b09'E-82\u00b048'E.

It flows westward through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern. Its tributaries include the Banjar, the [[Tawa River|Tawa]], the [[Machna]], the [[Shakkar River|Shakkar]], the [[Denwa]] and the [[Sonbhadra]] rivers. The [[Tapti River]] runs parallel to Narmada, and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmada\u2013Tapti systems carry an enormous volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source of water and acts as a lifeline to the state.\n\nThe [[Vindhyas]] form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the western part of the Ganges basin draining into the [[Yamuna]] and the eastern part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Shipra River|Shipra]], [[Kali Sindh River|Kali Sindh]], [[Parbati River (Madhya Pradesh)|Parbati]], [[Kuno River|Kuno]], [[Sind River|Sind]], [[Betwa River|Betwa]], [[Dhasan River|Dhasan]] and [[Ken River|Ken]] rivers being the main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the [[Ujjain Simhastha|Simhastha Kumbh Mela]], which is held every 12 years. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich, with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and [[dry deciduous forest]] types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the [[Son River|Son]], the [[Tons River|Tons]] and the [[Rihand]] Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills around [[Amarkantak]], is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on the south bank and that does not arise from the [[Himalayas]]. Son and its tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAfter the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of [[Mahanadi]] basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe [[Satpura]]s, in the [[Gawilgarh]] and [[Mahadeo Hills]], also contain a watershed, which is south facing. The [[Wainganga River|Wainganga]], the [[Wardha River|Wardha]], the Pench, the [[Kanhan River|Kanhan]] rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] river system. The Godavari basin consists of [[sub-tropical]], semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the Indrawati. There are many important multi-state irrigation projects in development, including the [[Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects]].\n\n=== Regions ===\nMadhya Pradesh is divided into the following agro-climatic zones:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kaimur Range|Kaimur]] Plateau and [[Satpura]] Hills\n* [[Vindhya]]n Plateau (Hills)\n* [[Narmada River|Narmada]] valley\n* [[Wainganga]] valley\n* [[Gird, India|Gird]] ([[Gwalior]]) Region\n* [[Bundelkhand]] Region\n* [[Satpura]] Plateau (Hills)\n* [[Malwa]] Plateau\n* [[Nimar]] Plateau\n* [[Jhabua]] Hills\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Administratation ===\nMadhya Pradesh is administratively divided into 10 divisions and further 52 districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mponline.gov.in/Portal/Content/mpprofile.aspx?langid=hi-in|title=MPOnline: Contact Government|website=Mponline.gov.in|accessdate=26 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802102010/http://www.mponline.gov.in/Portal/Content/mpprofile.aspx?langid=hi-in|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bhopal Division]]\n* [[Chambal Division]]\n* [[Gwalior Division]]\n* [[Indore Division]]\n* [[Jabalpur Division]]\n* [[Narmadapuram Division]]\n* [[Rewa Division]]\n* [[Sagar Division]]\n* [[Shahdol Division]]\n* [[Ujjain Division]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==== Cities ====\n{{Main|List of cities in Madhya Pradesh by population}}\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities of Madhya Pradesh\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Madhya Pradesh\n| stat_ref    = As of the [[List of cities in Madhya Pradesh by population|2011 Census]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_3_PR_UA_Citiees_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf | title = Urban Agglomerations/Cities having population 1 lakh and above | work = Provisional Population Totals, Census of India 2011 | accessdate = 13 February 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111113152754/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_3_PR_UA_Citiees_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf | archive-date = 13 November 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n| list_by_pop = Largest cities\n| div_name    = District\n| div_link    = List of districts of Madhya Pradesh{{!}}District\n\n| city_1 = Indore\n| div_1  = Indore district{{!}}Indore\n| pop_1  = 2,167,447\n| img_1  = Indore Rajwada01.jpg\n\n| city_2 = Bhopal\n| div_2  = Bhopal district{{!}}Bhopal\n| pop_2  = 1,883,381\n| img_2  = Bhopal city.jpg\n\n| city_3 = Jabalpur\n| div_3  = Jabalpur district{{!}}Jabalpur\n| pop_3  = 1,267,564\n| img_3  = ShivStatueAtKachnarCityJabalpur.JPG\n\n| city_4 = Gwalior\n| div_4  = Gwalior district{{!}}Gwalior\n| pop_4  = 1,101,981\n| img_4  = Gwalior fort - panoramio - Gyanendrasinghchauha\u2026 (12).jpg\n\n| city_5 = Ujjain\n| div_5  = Ujjain district{{!}}Ujjain\n| pop_5  = 593,368\n\n| city_6 = Sagar, Madhya Pradesh{{!}}Sagar\n| div_6  = Sagar district{{!}}Sagar\n| pop_6  = 370,296\n\n| city_7 = Dewas\n| div_7  = Dewas district{{!}}Dewas\n| pop_7  = 289,438\n\n| city_8 = Satna\n| div_8  = Satna district{{!}}Satna\n| pop_8  = 283,004\n\n| city_9 = Ratlam\n| div_9  = Ratlam district{{!}}Ratlam\n| pop_9  = 273,892\n\n| city_10 = Rewa, Madhya Pradesh{{!}}Rewa\n| div_10  = Rewa district{{!}}Rewa\n| pop_10  = 235,422\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Population ===\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Population Growth\n| 1951= 18615000\n| 1961= 23218000\n| 1971= 30017000\n| 1981= 38169000\n| 1991= 48566000\n| 2001= 60348000\n| 2011= 72597565\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census Population\">{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|title=Census Population|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219073658/http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe population of Madhya Pradesh consists of a number of [[ethnic group]]s and [[tribe]]s, [[caste]]s and communities, including the indigenous tribals and relatively more recent migrants from other states. The [[scheduled castes]] and the [[scheduled tribes]] constitute a significant portion of the [[population]] of the State. The main tribal groups in Madhya Pradesh are [[Gondi people|Gond]], [[Bhil]], [[Baiga (tribe)|Baiga]], [[Korku people|Korku]], [[Bharia people|Bhadia]] (or Bhariya), Halba, [[Kaul]], [[Madia Gond|Mariya]], [[Malto people|Malto]] and [[Sahariya]]. [[Dhar]], [[Jhabua]] and [[Mandla]] districts have more than 50 percent tribal population. In [[Khargone]], [[Chhindwara district|Chhindwara]], [[Seoni district|Seoni]], [[Sidhi]], [[Singrauli]] and [[Shahdol]] districts 30\u201350 percent population is of tribes.

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil''). In a taxonomic revision in 2004, the Vietnam mouse-deer was identified as an independent species in ''Tragulus''.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Meijaard |first2=C.P. |last2=Groves |year=2004 |url=http://zmmu.msu.ru/rjt/articles/ther3_1%2009_13%20Kuznez_Borisenko.pdf |title=A taxonomic revision of the ''Tragulus'' mouse-deer (Artiodactyla) |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=63\u2013102 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00091.x}}</ref>\n\n==Status and sightings==\nInformation on the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer is scarce; it is [[endemic]] to Vietnam and has been sighted only thrice in the wild. The four specimens obtained by Thomas were from [[Nha Trang]] ({{Coord|12|15|N|109|10|E}}) in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] on the southern coast of Vietnam; this need not be the original location for the species, as the specimens could have been traded from elsewhere.<ref name=iucn/> The mouse-deer was not reported for another 80 years until a Vietnamese-Russian expedition procured an adult male specimen from local hunters near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. This specimen, initially assumed to be a [[Java mouse-deer]] (''T. javanicus''), was deposited in the [[Zoological Museum of Moscow University]].

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').

The four specimens obtained by Thomas were from [[Nha Trang]] ({{Coord|12|15|N|109|10|E}}) in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] on the southern coast of Vietnam; this need not be the original location for the species, as the specimens could have been traded from elsewhere.<ref name=iucn/> The mouse-deer was not reported for another 80 years until a Vietnamese-Russian expedition procured an adult male specimen from local hunters near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]].

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a \"life bar\" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. \"low in [[cholesterol]]\"). A copyrighted \"heart-check\" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.<ref>\"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995.

However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).\n\nInverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.<ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969).

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

The complex is located near the village of [[Thornborough, North Yorkshire|Thornborough]], close to the town of [[Masham]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The complex includes many large ancient structures including a [[cursus]], [[henges]], burial grounds and settlements. \n\nThey are thought to have been part of a [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] '[[ritual landscape]]' comparable to [[Salisbury Plain]] and date from between 3500 and 2500 BC. This monument complex has been called 'The Stonehenge of the North'. [[Historic England]] considers its landscape comparable in ceremonial importance to better known sites such as [[Stonehenge]], [[Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites#Avebury and Associated Monuments|Avebury]],  and  [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Orkney]].<ref>{{PastScape |num=52056 |desc=Thornborough Henges |access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, there has been public concern about the impact on the ritual landscape of quarrying by [[Tarmac (company)|Tarmac]]. \n\n==Cursus==\nThe cursus is the oldest and largest ancient monument at Thornborough.  It is almost a mile in extent and runs from Thornborough Village, under the (later) central henge and terminates close to the River Ure in a broadly east/west alignment.\n\nCursuses are perhaps the most enigmatic of ancient monuments. They typically comprise two parallel ditches, the larger of which can be a mile or more in extent, cut to create a \"cigar shaped\" enclosure. Typically, burial mounds and mortuary enclosures are found alongside cursus monuments indicating that they probably had a ceremonial function.\n\n==Henges==\nThe three henges are almost identical in size and composition, each having a diameter of approximately 240 metres and two large entrances situated directly opposite each other. The henges are located around 550&nbsp;m apart on an approximate northwest-southeast alignment, although there is a curious 'dogleg' in the layout. Altogether, the monument extends for more than a mile.\n\nArchaeological excavation of the central henge has taken place. It has been suggested that its banks were covered with locally mined [[gypsum]]. The resulting white sheen would have been striking and visible for miles around. A double alignment of pits, possibly evidence of a timber processional avenue, extends from the southern henge.\n\nThe 'dogleg' in the layout appears to cause the layout of the henges to mirror the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]]. The exact purpose of the henges is unclear though archaeological finds suggest that they served economic and social purposes as well as astronomical ones.\n\nThe Northern henge is currently overgrown with trees but is one of the best preserved henges in Britain. The Central and Southern henges are in poorer condition although the banks of the henges are still quite prominent, especially in the case of the Central henge. To gain a full appreciation of the scale of the monument it is best viewed from the air.\n\n==Bealtaine==\n[[Image:MayKingandQueen.jpg|thumb|The May King and Queen, Thornborough Central Henge, Beltaine 2005]]\n\nAll three of the Thornborough henges and the narrow strip of land connecting them are [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]s. However, the land is privately owned and there is no official public access. Despite this, the site does have a steady stream of visitors throughout the year. \n\nSince 2004 there has been an opportunity for public access to the central henge, which is owned by Tarmac Northern Ltd.<ref>[http://www.tarmac.co.uk/nosterfield.aspx Nosterfield]</ref> to attend the celebration of the ancient [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festival of [[Bealtaine]]. On 1 May 2005 this event was attended by around 150 people from across the north of England.\n\n==Quarrying==\nExtensive quarrying has destroyed much of the monument's setting to the north and west of the henges. The site lies within the wider Nosterfield quarry area being exploited for gravel by [[Tarmac (company)|Tarmac Northern Ltd]]. Although the henges themselves are not threatened, Tarmac now wishes to extend its quarrying operations to a 45 hectare site less than a mile east of the henges known as 'Ladybridge Farm'.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hammond |first1=Norman |title=Battle to preserve Thornborough henges |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/battle-to-preserve-thornborough-henges-93s3062lkhc |accessdate=11 January 2019 |work=The Times |date=24 August 2004}}</ref> Preliminary investigations of this area of land to discern its archaeological significance have suggested that it may have been a location of ritual Neolithic encampments, possibly used by those people who built or visited the henges. Opponents of the plan claim that if permission was granted for this area to be quarried, much of the remaining contextual information about the henges would be lost. A campaign led by local people and concerned archaeologists is attempting to persuade Tarmac and [[North Yorkshire County Council]] to guarantee the protection of the area. [[PPG 16|British planning and archaeology guidelines]] prefer preservation ''in situ'' of archaeological remains. In cases where this is not possible, such as quarrying, preservation by record is an option, involving archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Campaigners argue that further excavation and subsequent quarrying will destroy the ritual landscape completely.\n\nIn 2002 Tarmac Northern Ltd. expressed an intention to apply for planning permission to quarry Thornborough Moor, thus intending to quarry right up to the edge of the designated scheduled monument area. In March 2005, Tarmac stated it would not seek to apply for planning permission to quarry this site for at least ten years, the period covered by North Yorkshire County Council's Minerals Plan.\n\nIn February 2006 North Yorkshire County Council turned down Tarmac's application to expand quarrying to the Ladybridge Farm site. Later in 2006 Tarmac submitted a revised planning application to North Yorkshire County Council. The revised application for Ladybridge, which is adjacent to the Nosterfield Quarry, reduced the proposed area for sand and gravel extraction from 45 hectares to 31 hectares, avoiding the south west section of the site to address concerns raised about archaeology. The application was approved in February 2007.\n\nLate in 2007 campaign group Friends of Thornborough requested a judicial review of the planning permission due to a number of procedural irregularities. In response, North Yorkshire County Council ruled the permission to be \"fatally flawed,\" and withdrew the permission previously granted. It is now planned that the planning application will be re-determined by North Yorkshire County Council planning committee on 22 April 2008. Planners indicated that granting of permission was likely. However, campaign group TimeWatch raised the issue of Neolithic archaeology found within the new quarry area since the last planning meeting.\n\nIn November 2016,  North Yorkshire County Council\u2019s planning committee agreed with the owners Tarmac to approve further quarrying in return for preserving{{clarify|date=March 2019}} the site of the Thornborough Henges and 90 acres of surrounding land, which would eventually be handed over to the public body.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Thornborough Henges}}\n* [http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/research/landscapes-and-areas/national-mapping-programme/thornborough-henges-nmp/ English Heritage: Thornborough Henges National Mapping Project]\n* [http://www.timewatch.org TimeWatch Thornborough Campaign]\n* [http://jqjacobs.net/blog/thornborough.html Thornborough Henges and the Ure-Swale Monuments], Assessing Evidence of Geospatial Intelligence in the Neolithic.\n* [http://www.tarmac.co.uk/nosterfield/  Tarmac Northern Ltd.]\n* [http://www.archaeologicalplanningconsultancy.co.uk/thornborough/index.php Recent excavations near the monuments]\n* [http://www.heritageaction.org/?page=campaigns_thornborough_planningapplicationsubmitted Heritage Action]\n* [http://www.thornboroughheritagetrust.org/ Thornborough Heritage Trust]\n* [http://thornborough.ncl.ac.uk/index.htm Homepage of the Thornborough Project at the University of Newcastle]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/4734994.stm BBC News: Monument quarry plans thrown out 21 February 2006]\n* [http://society.guardian.co.uk/environment/story/0,,1457896,00.html Guardian Article: Burying Treasures]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060207100314/http://www.sacredbrigantia.com/ Beltaine Celebrations at Thornborough Central henge]\n* [http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/thornborough/main.htm The Neolithic Monument Complex of Thornborough, North Yorkshire] Maps\n* [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/archive/thornborough_eh_2008/ Thornborough: Neolithic and Bronze-Age monument complex], fieldwork by [[Newcastle University]]\n* [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/archive/thornborough_ap_eh_2006/ Thornborough Henges: Air Photo Mapping Project], by [[English Heritage]] and Archaeological Services WYAS\n* [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/archive/thornconserv_eh_2008/ Thornborough Moor and Landscape Conservation Plan] For Thornborough Henges Consultation and Working Group, 2005\n\n{{Coord|54.20599|N|1.57223|W|region:GB_source:enwiki-osgb36(SE2879)|display=title}}<!-- Note: WGS84 lat/long, converted from OSGB36 grid ref -->\n\n{{Prehistoric technology}}\n\n[[Category:History of North Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in North Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Stone Age sites in England]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in North Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Henges]]\n[[Category:Bronze Age sites in North Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Wensleydale]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Neolithic henge complex in North Yorkshire, England}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2019}}\n{{use British English|date=January 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n[[Image:Thornborough Henge.jpg|thumb|right|The three [[henge]]s of the Thornborough Henges complex]]\nThe '''Thornborough Henges''' are an unusual ancient monument complex that includes the three aligned [[henge]]s that give the site its name.
