The [[industrialisation]] of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid [[urbanisation]] had led to an emerging class of [[Proletariat|urban workers]]. The social democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group [[political rights]] and [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[Folketing]], the Danish [[parliament]]. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto. The stated policy was as follows: {{quote|The Danish Social Democratic Labour Party works in its national form, but is convinced of the international nature of the labour movement and ready to sacrifice everything and fulfill all obligations to provide: Freedom, equality and brotherhood among all nations.}}\n\nIn 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely [[Peter Thygesen Holm]] and [[Chresten H\u00f8rdum]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark]] and current party's [[youth wing]] was founded.\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]], the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with [[Thorvald Stauning]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|title=Den skjulte forskel|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718072428/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|archivedate=18 July 2013}}</ref> That same year, he appointed [[Nina Bang]] as the world's first female minister, nine years after [[women's suffrage]] had been given in Denmark.

By the early 20th century, it had become the party with the largest representation in the Folketing, a distinction it would hold for 77 years. It first formed a government after the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]] under [[Thorvald Stauning]], the longest-serving [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Danish Prime Minister]] of the 20th century. During Stauning's government which lasted until the [[1926 Danish Folketing election|1926 elections]], the Social Democrats exerted a profound influence on [[Danish society]], laying the foundation of the Danish [[welfare state]]. From 2002 to 2016, the party used the name ''Socialdemokraterne'' in some contexts.<ref name=\"name1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/nyheder/socialdemokratiet-skifter-navn|title=Socialdemokratiet skifter navn|date=14 September 2002|accessdate=26 September 2016|work=BT/Ritzau}}</ref><ref name=\"name2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altinget.dk/artikel/socialdemokratiet-laegger-navn-i-graven|title=Socialdemokratiet laver lille navne\u00e6ndring|date=24 September 2016|accessdate=26 September 2016|work=Altinget|last1=Lange|first1=Lasse|last2=Holsten|first2=Erik}}</ref>\n\nThe party was the [[Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt|major coalition partner]] in government from the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 elections]], with then-party leader [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].

This name was formally carried by the party for almost a hundred years, although in practice it also used a number of other names until it changed its name to Social Democracy in 1965.

The [[industrialisation]] of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid [[urbanisation]] had led to an emerging class of [[Proletariat|urban workers]]. The social democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group [[political rights]] and [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[Folketing]], the Danish [[parliament]]. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto. The stated policy was as follows: {{quote|The Danish Social Democratic Labour Party works in its national form, but is convinced of the international nature of the labour movement and ready to sacrifice everything and fulfill all obligations to provide: Freedom, equality and brotherhood among all nations.}}\n\nIn 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely [[Peter Thygesen Holm]] and [[Chresten H\u00f8rdum]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark]] and current party's [[youth wing]] was founded.\n\nIn the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]], the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with [[Thorvald Stauning]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|title=Den skjulte forskel|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718072428/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|archivedate=18 July 2013}}</ref> That same year, he appointed [[Nina Bang]] as the world's first female minister, nine years after [[women's suffrage]] had been given in Denmark.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings, and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests.

She was concerned over the risk to organisers regarding the possible disruption by protestors of public events and press conferences.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval rating declined to 22.3 in October 2019, lowest among all chief executives.

The establishment waited for demonstrators' aggression to increase so they could justify greater militarisation of the police and dismiss the protesters as \"insurgents\" and also their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer holds a blue flag warning the protesters to disperse at an unapproved march.]]\nThe reputation of the police took a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October 2019, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, their aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represents hostility and suppression.

People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead despite calls asking her to resign. As for the demand to set up an independent commission to investigate police misconduct, she insisted that the existing mechanism, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) would suffice.<ref name=\"scmp_3017795\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190709\"/>\n\nAfter condemning the protesters for storming the legislature on 1&nbsp;July for their \"use of extreme violence\"<ref name=\"hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation\"/> and defacing the national emblem during the 21&nbsp;July protest,<ref name=\"coconutshk_20190722\"/> Lam suggested in early August 2019 that the protests had deviated from their original purpose and that their goal now was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage \"one country, two systems\".<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> She suggested that radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a \"point of no return\"<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\" /> and that they had \"no stake in society\",<ref name=\"standardhk_132809\"/> a remark that was criticised by some civil servants.<ref name=\"standardhk_133040\"/>\n\nFollowing a rally on 18&nbsp;August that was attended by more than 1.7&nbsp;million people, Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue.<ref name=\"scmp_3023512\"/> On 4&nbsp;September, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, introduce measures such as introducing new members to the IPCC, engaging in dialogue at the community level, and inviting academics to evaluate Hong Kong's deep-rooted problems. However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that their five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stages of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26&nbsp;September 2019.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>.

As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

Singer told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''The Fifth Estate'' in 2006 that he stood by the position that the EPA had \"cooked the data\" to show that [[second-hand smoke]] causes lung cancer. CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

When the report was released by the de Tocqueville institution as the first chapter of the report ''Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination'', Singer's credit was changed from lead author to \"reviewer\".\n* For the final version of the report, see [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/documentStore/d/v/r/dvr49b00/Sdvr49b00.pdf \"Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination\"], Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, August 11, 1994, accessed Dec. 26 2012</ref> The report criticized the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for their 1993 study about the cancer risks of passive smoking, calling it \"junk science\". Singer told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''The Fifth Estate'' in 2006 that he stood by the position that the EPA had \"cooked the data\" to show that [[second-hand smoke]] causes lung cancer. CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money. That's not my business.\"<ref name=CBCsmoking /> In December 2010 he wrote in ''[[American Thinker]]'' that he is nonsmoker who finds [[second-hand smoke]] an unpleasant irritant that cannot be healthy; he also wrote that his father, a heavy smoker, died of [[emphysema]] when relatively young. According to Singer, he serves on the advisory board of an anti-smoking organization, and has never been paid by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] or the [[Tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]].<ref>Singer, S.

He told CBC: \"It was warmer a thousand years ago than it is today. Vikings settled Greenland. Is that good or bad? I think it's good. They grew wine in England, in northern England. I think that's good. At least some people think so.\"<ref>\"The Denial Machine,\" 20:10 mins.</ref> \"We are certainly putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" he told ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2009. \"However there is no evidence that this high CO<sub>2</sub> is making a detectable difference. It should in principle, however the atmosphere is very complicated and one cannot simply argue that just because CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas it causes warming.\"<ref name=\"Gray2009\" /> He believes that radical environmentalists are exaggerating the dangers. \"The underlying effort here seems to be to use global warming as an excuse to cut down the use of energy,\" he said. \"It's very simple: if you cut back the use of energy, then you cut back economic growth.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty. In 2007 he collaborated on a study that found tropospheric temperature trends of \"Climate of the 20th Century\" models differed from satellite observations by twice the model mean uncertainty.<ref>Douglass, David H.; Christy, John R.; Pearson, Benjamin D.; Singer, S.

The meeting included Singer's group, the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain.

When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.<ref>Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned.

[[Melissa Etheridge]] contributed three songs to the film. In the film, the adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda continue.

Walt Disney Home Entertainment. May 26, 2006. Retrieved May 27, 2006</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPicking up several months after the events of the [[Brother Bear|first film]], Kenai, now a bear, is living joyfully with his foster brother Koda. Having just awoken from hibernation, the bears begin traveling to Crowberry Ridge for the first berries of the season. However, Kenai is plagued by [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of his childhood friend Nita, to whom he gave a special amulet many years ago after saving her from drowning. Nita, now grown up, is set to wed Atka, a man from a neighboring [[Inuit]] village. However, on the day of the wedding, the Spirits appear in the form of a storm that causes a fissure to open up in the ground between Nita and Atka, much to Nita's shock. Believing it to be a sign, Nita consults Innoko, the wisest shaman of the tribes. By communicating with the Spirits, Innoko reveals that the amulet that Kenai gave Nita all those years ago bonded her and Kenai together. The only way for Nita to sever the bond and be able to marry Atka is to find Kenai, go with him to Hokani Falls (where Kenai gave Nita the amulet), and burn the amulet on the eve of the [[Equinox]], thus returning the bond to the Spirits. Innoko grants Nita the ability to communicate with Kenai and the other wildlife.\n\nEventually, Kenai and Koda meet up with Nita. At first, Kenai refuses to destroy the bond, but Nita tells him that the Spirits may turn him back into a human and send him to find her. Under pressure from Nita and Koda, who is upset that he and Kenai could no longer be brothers if this happens, Kenai relents and the three make their way to Hokani Falls. As they spend more time together, Kenai and Nita rekindle their old friendship, much to Koda's annoyance. One night, Nita asks Kenai if he ever thought of being human again. When Kenai says that he has considered it, Koda hears this and races up a mountain, anxious that Kenai may leave him. Nita finds Koda hiding in a cave, but both are caught in an avalanche and are rescued by Kenai. Kenai shouts at Koda for almost getting himself killed, but the two reconcile with Kenai assuring Koda that he would never leave him.\n\nThe trio eventually make it to Hokani Falls, where they burn the amulet. Without it, Nita can no longer communicate with Kenai or Koda, so she says goodbye. Seeing how miserable Kenai is and realizing that he loves Nita, Koda secretly asks his mother in the spirit world to turn Kenai back into a human so he can be happy. The next morning, Rutt and Tuke (whom Kenai, Koda, and Nita ran into multiple times throughout their journey, and whom Nita helped woo a pair of female Canadian moose) inform Kenai that Koda went to the village to retrieve Nita. Knowing that Koda will be killed, Kenai runs after him.\n\nAt the village, the tribes prepare for the wedding once again, but Nita, realizing her feelings are for Kenai, tells her father Chilkoot that she cannot marry Atka. At that moment, Koda creates a major commotion in the village in order to get Nita's attention, while Kenai arrives to stop Koda. Rutt and Tuke rescue Koda from two of the villagers, while Atka fights with Kenai, throwing him off of a cliff and into shallow water. Nita rushes to Kenai's aide, where the two profess their love for each other. The Spirits appear to change Kenai back into a human, allowing Nita to communicate with Kenai and Koda.

[[Melissa Etheridge]] contributed three songs to the film. In the film, the adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda continue.

Having just awoken from hibernation, the bears begin traveling to Crowberry Ridge for the first berries of the season. However, Kenai is plagued by [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of his childhood friend Nita, to whom he gave a special amulet many years ago after saving her from drowning. Nita, now grown up, is set to wed Atka, a man from a neighboring [[Inuit]] village. However, on the day of the wedding, the Spirits appear in the form of a storm that causes a fissure to open up in the ground between Nita and Atka, much to Nita's shock. Believing it to be a sign, Nita consults Innoko, the wisest shaman of the tribes. By communicating with the Spirits, Innoko reveals that the amulet that Kenai gave Nita all those years ago bonded her and Kenai together. The only way for Nita to sever the bond and be able to marry Atka is to find Kenai, go with him to Hokani Falls (where Kenai gave Nita the amulet), and burn the amulet on the eve of the [[Equinox]], thus returning the bond to the Spirits. Innoko grants Nita the ability to communicate with Kenai and the other wildlife.\n\nEventually, Kenai and Koda meet up with Nita. At first, Kenai refuses to destroy the bond, but Nita tells him that the Spirits may turn him back into a human and send him to find her. Under pressure from Nita and Koda, who is upset that he and Kenai could no longer be brothers if this happens, Kenai relents and the three make their way to Hokani Falls. As they spend more time together, Kenai and Nita rekindle their old friendship, much to Koda's annoyance. One night, Nita asks Kenai if he ever thought of being human again. When Kenai says that he has considered it, Koda hears this and races up a mountain, anxious that Kenai may leave him. Nita finds Koda hiding in a cave, but both are caught in an avalanche and are rescued by Kenai. Kenai shouts at Koda for almost getting himself killed, but the two reconcile with Kenai assuring Koda that he would never leave him.\n\nThe trio eventually make it to Hokani Falls, where they burn the amulet. Without it, Nita can no longer communicate with Kenai or Koda, so she says goodbye. Seeing how miserable Kenai is and realizing that he loves Nita, Koda secretly asks his mother in the spirit world to turn Kenai back into a human so he can be happy. The next morning, Rutt and Tuke (whom Kenai, Koda, and Nita ran into multiple times throughout their journey, and whom Nita helped woo a pair of female Canadian moose) inform Kenai that Koda went to the village to retrieve Nita. Knowing that Koda will be killed, Kenai runs after him.\n\nAt the village, the tribes prepare for the wedding once again, but Nita, realizing her feelings are for Kenai, tells her father Chilkoot that she cannot marry Atka. At that moment, Koda creates a major commotion in the village in order to get Nita's attention, while Kenai arrives to stop Koda. Rutt and Tuke rescue Koda from two of the villagers, while Atka fights with Kenai, throwing him off of a cliff and into shallow water. Nita rushes to Kenai's aide, where the two profess their love for each other. The Spirits appear to change Kenai back into a human, allowing Nita to communicate with Kenai and Koda. Kenai tells Nita that he cannot become a human again and leave Koda, but Nita tells him that she can be with him. With her father's blessing, the Spirits transform Nita into a bear. The film ends with Kenai and Nita's wedding that the tribes, bears, Koda, Rutt, Tuke and their mates happily watch.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Kenai\n* [[Jeremy Suarez]] as Koda\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Nita\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Rutt\n* [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] as Tuke\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Tug\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Anda\n* [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] as Atka\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kata\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Innoko\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Siqiniq\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Taqqiq\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as Hoonah\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Bering and Chilkoot\n* Jack Weber as Young Kenai\n* Jessie Flower as Young Nita\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[DisneyToon Studios]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Baisley|first=Sarah|title=Disneytoon Studios Prexy Morrill Steps Down|url=http://www.awn.com/news/people/disneytoon-studios-prexy-morrill-steps-down|accessdate=April 19, 2012|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref> [[Disney Animation Australia]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney to axe Sydney studio|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/disney-to-axe-sydney-studio/2005/07/26/1122143838088.html|accessdate=March 12, 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=July 26, 2005}}</ref> and Project Firefly, a start up animation company founded by former [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Disney Feature Animation Florida]] employees.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Roger|title=Drawn to the light|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-01-31/news/FIREFLY_1_firefly-animation-disney|accessdate=March 6, 2018|work=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=January 31, 2006|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Brother Bear 2'' received generally mixed reviews from critics, and the film currently holds a 50% in [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and an average rating of 5.6/10 (based on 8 votes).<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Brother Bear 2|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brother_bear_2/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The film is the second direct-to-video sequel to have a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than its predecessor, with the first film being ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''.\n\nEnthusiastic reviews included Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures, which wrote \"The kids will love \"Brother Bear 2,\" especially if they loved the first film.

The company manufactures components for jet engines, fasteners and titanium structures for aerospace applications, and forged aluminum wheels for heavy trucks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howmet.com/markets-and-product-lines/|title=Markets & Product Lines {{!}} Howmet Aerospace|website=Howmet.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>   \n\nHowmet operates 27 facilities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[France]], the [[UK]], [[Hungary]] and [[Japan]].\n\n==History==\nHowmet's roots can be traced back to 1926 with the founding of Austenal, a company which manufactured raw materials and process for dental appliances. Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co.

Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co. (MISCO), which provided the monolithic shell process, which uses a ceramic shell with thin, strong walls to increase control of the solidification process to produce a sounder [[casting]].\n\nHowe became Howmet in 1965, marking a transition from a mining company to a manufacturer of precision metal products.
