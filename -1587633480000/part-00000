It is still commonly used by linguists working on, among others, [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] languages and for the [[languages of the Caucasus]] and [[languages of India|of India]]; however, Uralists commonly use a variant known as the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]]. Despite its name, the term \"Americanist phonetic alphabet\" has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the {{lang|de|[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft]]}}, the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]].\n\nCertain symbols in NAPA have been used as [[obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet]] in certain transcriptions. Over the years, NAPA has drawn closer to the IPA. However, there remain significant differences. Among these are:\n\n*{{angbr|y}} for {{IPA|[j]}}, {{angbr|\u00f1}} for {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, {{angbr|c}} or {{angbr|\u00a2}} for {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}}, {{angbr|\u019b}} for {{IPA|[t\u0361\u026c]}} and {{angbr|\u0142}} for {{IPA|[\u026c]}}\n*Palato-alveolar {{angbr|\u010d \u01f0 \u0161 \u017e}} and sometimes alveopalatal {{angbr|\u0107 \u015b \u017a \u0144}}\n*Advancing diacritic (inverted breve) for dentals and palatals (apart from non-sibilant dental {{angbr|\u03b8 \u00f0}}), and retracting diacritic (a dot) for retroflex and uvulars (apart from uvular {{angbr|q}})\n*{{angbr|r}} or {{angbr|\u0159}} for a flap and {{angbr|r\u0303}} for a trill\n*[[Ogonek]] for nasalization\n*Dot over vowel for centering, two dots (diaeresis) over a vowel to change fronting (for front rounded vowels and unrounded back vowels)\n*Acute and grave accents over vowels for stress\n\n== History ==\n[[John Wesley Powell]] used an early set of phonetic symbols in his publications (particularly Powell 1880) on American language families, although he chose symbols which had their origins in work by other phoneticians and American writers (''e.g.'', Pickering 1820; Cass 1821a, 1821b; Hale 1846; Lepsius 1855, 1863; Gibbs 1861; and Powell 1877). The influential anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] used a somewhat different set of symbols (Boas 1911). In 1916, a publication by the American Anthropological Society greatly expanded upon Boas's alphabet. This same alphabet was discussed and modified in articles by Bloomfield & Bolling (1927) and Herzog ''et al.'' (1934). The Americanist notation may be seen in the journals ''[[American Anthropologist]]'', ''[[International Journal of American Linguistics]]'', and [[Language (journal)|''Language'']]. Useful sources explaining the symbols \u2013 some with comparisons of the alphabets used at different times \u2013 are Campbell (1997:xii-xiii), Goddard (1996:10-16), Langacker (1972:xiii-vi), Mithun (1999:xiii-xv), and Odden (2005).\n\nIt is often useful to compare the Americanist tradition with another widespread tradition, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). Unlike the IPA,{{citation needed}} Americanist phonetic notation does not require a strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that, to represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other specific uses, gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from [[typefaces]] of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.\n\nAbercrombie (1991:44-45) recounts the following concerning the Americanist tradition:\n{{quote|In America phonetic notation has had a curious history. [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] used IPA notation in his early book ''An Introduction to the Study of Language'', 1914, and in the English edition of his more famous ''Language'', 1935. But since then, a strange hostility has been shown by many American linguists to IPA notation, especially to certain of its symbols.\n\nAn interesting and significant story was once told by [[Charles F. Voegelin|Carl Voegelin]] during a symposium held in New York in 1952 on the present state of anthropology. He told how, at the beginning of the 1930s, he was being taught phonetics by, as he put it, a \"pleasant Dane\", who made him use the IPA symbol for ''sh'' in ''ship'', among others. Some while later he used those symbols in some work on an American Indian language he had done for [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]]. When Sapir saw the work he \"simply blew up\", Voegelin said, and demanded that in future Voegelin should use 's wedge' (as \u0161 was called), instead of the IPA symbol.\n\nI have no doubt that the \"pleasant Dane\" was [[H. J. Uldall]], one of [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Jones]]'s most brilliant students, who was later to become one of the founders of [[glossematics]], with [[Louis Hjelmslev]]. Uldall did a great deal of research into Californian languages, especially into [[Maidu language|Maidu]] or [[Nisenan language|Nisenan]]. Most of the texts he collected were not published during his lifetime. It is ironic that when they were published, posthumously, by the University of California Press, the texts were \"reorthographized\", as the editor's introduction put it: the IPA symbols Uldall had used were removed and replaced by others.\n\nWhat is strange is that the IPA symbols seem so obviously preferable to the Americanist alternatives, the 'long s' to the 's wedge', for example. As Jones often pointed out, in connected texts, for the sake of legibility diacritics should be avoided as far as possible. Many Americanist texts give the impression of being overloaded with diacritics.\n\nOne may wonder why there should be such a hostility in America to IPA notation. I venture to suggest a reason for this apparently irrational attitude. The hostility derives ultimately from the existence, in most American universities, of Speech Departments, which we do not have in Britain. Speech Departments tend to be well-endowed, large, and powerful. In linguistic and phonetic matters they have a reputation for being predominantly [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]], and tend to be considered by some therefore to be not very scholarly. In their publications and periodicals the notation they use, when writing of pronunciation, is that of the IPA. My belief is that the last thing a member of an American Linguistics Department wants is to be mistaken for a member of a Speech Department; but if he were to use IPA notation in his writings he would certainly lay himself open to the suspicion that he was.}}\n\n== Alphabet ==\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThere is no central authority.

This usage is common practice in Americanist and also other notational traditions (such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]). This lack of detail, although economical and phonologically sound, requires a more careful reading of a given language's phonological description to determine the precise phonetics. A list of rhotics is given below.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:larger; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid;\"\n|+ Common rhotic conventions\n! || style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Alveolar || style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Retroflex/Uvular\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Approximant\n| r || \u1e5b\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Flap\n| \u0159 || \u1e5b\u030c\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Tap\n| \u1d05 ||\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Trill\n| r\u0303 || \u1e5b\u0303\n|}\n\nOther flaps are {{angle bracket|\u0148, l\u0306}} etc.\n\n==== Alternate symbols ====\nThere are many alternate symbols seen in Americanist transcription.

There is however little standardization of rhotics, and {{angle bracket|\u1e5b}} may be either retroflex or uvular, though as noted above {{angle bracket|\u1e5b}} or {{angle bracket|\u1e5b\u030c}} may be a retroflex flap vs {{angle bracket|\u1e5b\u0303}} as a uvular trill. Apart from the ambiguity of the rhotics below, and minor graphic variants (\u023c g \u03b3 for c \u0261 \u0263 and the placement of the diacritic in g\u0311 \u03b3\u0311), this is compatible with the WIELD recommendations.

It is still commonly used by linguists working on, among others, [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] languages and for the [[languages of the Caucasus]] and [[languages of India|of India]]; however, Uralists commonly use a variant known as the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]]. Despite its name, the term \"Americanist phonetic alphabet\" has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the {{lang|de|[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft]]}}, the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]].\n\nCertain symbols in NAPA have been used as [[obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet]] in certain transcriptions. Over the years, NAPA has drawn closer to the IPA. However, there remain significant differences. Among these are:\n\n*{{angbr|y}} for {{IPA|[j]}}, {{angbr|\u00f1}} for {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, {{angbr|c}} or {{angbr|\u00a2}} for {{IPA|[t\u0361s]}}, {{angbr|\u019b}} for {{IPA|[t\u0361\u026c]}} and {{angbr|\u0142}} for {{IPA|[\u026c]}}\n*Palato-alveolar {{angbr|\u010d \u01f0 \u0161 \u017e}} and sometimes alveopalatal {{angbr|\u0107 \u015b \u017a \u0144}}\n*Advancing diacritic (inverted breve) for dentals and palatals (apart from non-sibilant dental {{angbr|\u03b8 \u00f0}}), and retracting diacritic (a dot) for retroflex and uvulars (apart from uvular {{angbr|q}})\n*{{angbr|r}} or {{angbr|\u0159}} for a flap and {{angbr|r\u0303}} for a trill\n*[[Ogonek]] for nasalization\n*Dot over vowel for centering, two dots (diaeresis) over a vowel to change fronting (for front rounded vowels and unrounded back vowels)\n*Acute and grave accents over vowels for stress\n\n== History ==\n[[John Wesley Powell]] used an early set of phonetic symbols in his publications (particularly Powell 1880) on American language families, although he chose symbols which had their origins in work by other phoneticians and American writers (''e.g.'', Pickering 1820; Cass 1821a, 1821b; Hale 1846; Lepsius 1855, 1863; Gibbs 1861; and Powell 1877). The influential anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] used a somewhat different set of symbols (Boas 1911). In 1916, a publication by the American Anthropological Society greatly expanded upon Boas's alphabet. This same alphabet was discussed and modified in articles by Bloomfield & Bolling (1927) and Herzog ''et al.'' (1934). The Americanist notation may be seen in the journals ''[[American Anthropologist]]'', ''[[International Journal of American Linguistics]]'', and [[Language (journal)|''Language'']]. Useful sources explaining the symbols \u2013 some with comparisons of the alphabets used at different times \u2013 are Campbell (1997:xii-xiii), Goddard (1996:10-16), Langacker (1972:xiii-vi), Mithun (1999:xiii-xv), and Odden (2005).\n\nIt is often useful to compare the Americanist tradition with another widespread tradition, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation does not require a strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that, to represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other specific uses, gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from [[typefaces]] of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.\n\nAbercrombie (1991:44-45) recounts the following concerning the Americanist tradition:\n{{quote|In America phonetic notation has had a curious history. [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] used IPA notation in his early book ''An Introduction to the Study of Language'', 1914, and in the English edition of his more famous ''Language'', 1935. But since then, a strange hostility has been shown by many American linguists to IPA notation, especially to certain of its symbols.\n\nAn interesting and significant story was once told by [[Charles F. Voegelin|Carl Voegelin]] during a symposium held in New York in 1952 on the present state of anthropology. He told how, at the beginning of the 1930s, he was being taught phonetics by, as he put it, a \"pleasant Dane\", who made him use the IPA symbol for ''sh'' in ''ship'', among others. Some while later he used those symbols in some work on an American Indian language he had done for [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]]. When Sapir saw the work he \"simply blew up\", Voegelin said, and demanded that in future Voegelin should use 's wedge' (as \u0161 was called), instead of the IPA symbol.\n\nI have no doubt that the \"pleasant Dane\" was [[H. J. Uldall]], one of [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Jones]]'s most brilliant students, who was later to become one of the founders of [[glossematics]], with [[Louis Hjelmslev]]. Uldall did a great deal of research into Californian languages, especially into [[Maidu language|Maidu]] or [[Nisenan language|Nisenan]]. Most of the texts he collected were not published during his lifetime. It is ironic that when they were published, posthumously, by the University of California Press, the texts were \"reorthographized\", as the editor's introduction put it: the IPA symbols Uldall had used were removed and replaced by others.\n\nWhat is strange is that the IPA symbols seem so obviously preferable to the Americanist alternatives, the 'long s' to the 's wedge', for example. As Jones often pointed out, in connected texts, for the sake of legibility diacritics should be avoided as far as possible. Many Americanist texts give the impression of being overloaded with diacritics.\n\nOne may wonder why there should be such a hostility in America to IPA notation. I venture to suggest a reason for this apparently irrational attitude. The hostility derives ultimately from the existence, in most American universities, of Speech Departments, which we do not have in Britain. Speech Departments tend to be well-endowed, large, and powerful. In linguistic and phonetic matters they have a reputation for being predominantly [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]], and tend to be considered by some therefore to be not very scholarly. In their publications and periodicals the notation they use, when writing of pronunciation, is that of the IPA. My belief is that the last thing a member of an American Linguistics Department wants is to be mistaken for a member of a Speech Department; but if he were to use IPA notation in his writings he would certainly lay himself open to the suspicion that he was.}}\n\n== Alphabet ==\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThere is no central authority.

This lack of detail, although economical and phonologically sound, requires a more careful reading of a given language's phonological description to determine the precise phonetics. A list of rhotics is given below.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:larger; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid;\"\n|+ Common rhotic conventions\n! || style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Alveolar || style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Retroflex/Uvular\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Approximant\n| r || \u1e5b\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Flap\n| \u0159 || \u1e5b\u030c\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Tap\n| \u1d05 ||\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:x-small\" | Trill\n| r\u0303 || \u1e5b\u0303\n|}\n\nOther flaps are {{angle bracket|\u0148, l\u0306}} etc.\n\n==== Alternate symbols ====\nThere are many alternate symbols seen in Americanist transcription.

There is however little standardization of rhotics, and {{angle bracket|\u1e5b}} may be either retroflex or uvular, though as noted above {{angle bracket|\u1e5b}} or {{angle bracket|\u1e5b\u030c}} may be a retroflex flap vs {{angle bracket|\u1e5b\u0303}} as a uvular trill. Apart from the ambiguity of the rhotics below, and minor graphic variants (\u023c g \u03b3 for c \u0261 \u0263 and the placement of the diacritic in g\u0311 \u03b3\u0311), this is compatible with the WIELD recommendations.

It is the most populous city in Northern Finland, and the fifth most populous in the country. Only the city of [[Murmansk]], Russia, has more people and is further north.\n\nOulu is considered one of Europe's \"living labs\", where residents experiment with new technology (such as [[Near-field communication|NFC tags]] and [[Ubiquitous computing|ubi]]-screens) on a community-wide scale.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn= |page=63 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city is named after the river [[Oulujoki]], which originates in the lake [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]]. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009. Oulu and the municipalities of [[Haukipudas]], [[Kiiminki]], [[Oulunsalo]], and [[Yli-Ii]] were merged on 1 January 2013.<ref name=\"uusioulu\">{{cite web|title=Uusi Oulu|url=http://www.ouka.fi/uusioulu/|publisher=City of Oulu|accessdate=19 September 2011|location=Oulu|language=Finnish|trans-title=New Oulu | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOulu was the site of the 2018 [[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]].

Mainland Finland's northernmost and southernmost points are roughly [[equidistant]] from Oulu. Oulu's coast sits at the [[Bothnian Bay]] (''Per\u00e4meri'' in Finnish) and the [[Sweden|Swedish mainland]] is about 180&nbsp;km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. The nearby island [[Hailuoto]] is just off the coast.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{Category see also|Districts of Oulu}}\nOulu is divided into 106 city districts. The largest of these are [[Haukipudas]], [[Oulunsalo]], [[Kaakkuri]], [[Ritaharju]], [[Tuira, Oulu|Tuira]], and [[Kello]].\n\n===Climate===\nOulu has a [[subarctic climate|subarctic continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfc'').

name=\"population_count\"/> in the region of [[North Ostrobothnia]], [[Finland]]. It is the most populous city in Northern Finland, and the fifth most populous in the country. Only the city of [[Murmansk]], Russia, has more people and is further north.\n\nOulu is considered one of Europe's \"living labs\", where residents experiment with new technology (such as [[Near-field communication|NFC tags]] and [[Ubiquitous computing|ubi]]-screens) on a community-wide scale.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn= |page=63 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city is named after the river [[Oulujoki]], which originates in the lake [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]]. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009. Oulu and the municipalities of [[Haukipudas]], [[Kiiminki]], [[Oulunsalo]], and [[Yli-Ii]] were merged on 1 January 2013.<ref name=\"uusioulu\">{{cite web|title=Uusi Oulu|url=http://www.ouka.fi/uusioulu/|publisher=City of Oulu|accessdate=19 September 2011|location=Oulu|language=Finnish|trans-title=New Oulu | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOulu was the site of the 2018 [[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]].

Mainland Finland's northernmost and southernmost points are roughly [[equidistant]] from Oulu. Oulu's coast sits at the [[Bothnian Bay]] (''Per\u00e4meri'' in Finnish) and the [[Sweden|Swedish mainland]] is about 180&nbsp;km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. The nearby island [[Hailuoto]] is just off the coast.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{Category see also|Districts of Oulu}}\nOulu is divided into 106 city districts.
