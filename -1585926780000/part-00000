There are around 42 independent power producers (IPPs) that contribute significantly in electricity generation in Pakistan.\n\n==History==\nPakistan electricity sector is a developing market. For years, the matter of balancing the country's supply against the demand for electricity had remained a largely unresolved matter. The country faced significant challenges in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity. Electricity generators were seeking a parity in returns for both domestic and foreign investors indicating it to be one of the key issues in overseeing a surge in electricity generation when the country was facing growing shortages. Other problems included lack of efficiency, rising demands for energy, and political instability.<ref>http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-loadshedding-to-end-by-next-summer-us-hs-06</ref> Provincial and federal agencies, who are the largest consumers, often do not pay their bills.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/05/pakistan%E2%80%99s-energy-crisis Power Politics:Pakistan's energy crisis] The Economist, 21 May 2012</ref> At one point electricity generation had shrunk by up to 50% due to an over-reliance on fossil fuels.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=90379|title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News|website=www.thenews.com.pk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> The country was hit by its worst power crisis in 2007 when production fell by 6000 Megawatts and massive blackouts followed suit.<ref name=\"etribune\">{{cite web|url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=864 |title=Pakistan's Ongoing Electricity Shortage |publisher=Energy Tribune |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> [[Rolling blackout|Load Shedding]] and power blackouts had become severe in Pakistan before 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pakistaniat.com/2008/01/03/more-crises-in-pakistan-electricity-flour-sugar-water-sui-gas-crises-what-is-the-way-out/ |title=More Crises in Pakistan: Electricity, Flour, Sugar, Water, Sui Gas Crises \u2013 What is the way out? : ALL THINGS PAKISTAN |publisher=Pakistaniat.com |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 unfolds that Pakistan's installed capacity to generate electricity has surged up to 29,573MW by February 2018 which stood at 22,812MW in June 2013, showing the growth of 30 percent.<ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/309535-country-s-installed-electricity-capacity-increases-by-30pc-to-29-573mw</ref>\n\n==Installed capacity==\nPakistan's installed capacity to generate electricity has surged up to 33,836 MW by February 2019 which stood at 23,337 MW in 2014, showing the growth of 45 percent in five years.\n\n== Electricity Concerns ==\nAlthough Pakistan has reduced blackouts and increased electricity production significantly, blackouts are still common, and the price of electricity has still increased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/cpi|title=Monthly Price Indices (Base Year 2007-08) {{!}} Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|website=www.pbs.gov.pk|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> Recent tariff have contributed to this increase in prices.\n\n==Thermal==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

K-Electric Limited (formally known as Karachi Electric Supply Company), which is responsible for power generation and distribution in the Karachi area, is\nlisted on the stock exchanges and is privately owned.

During the floods and rainfalls the recently constructed Jinnah hydroelectric power plant was flooded in addition to severe damages to transmission and distribution network and installations while several power plants and refineries were threatened by rising waters and had to be shut down. Natural gas field output had to be reduced as the flood waters approached the wells. There has also been some concern by Pakistani nuclear activists over the effect of natural disasters on nuclear plants specially over the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]], since the plant lies over a geological fault.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/AL23Df01.html |title=Asia Times: Pakistan's nuclear program built on shifting sands |publisher=Atimes.com |date=23 December 1999 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\\story_16-9-2010_pg13_1 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |work=Daily Times|date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2009/01/31/local1.htm |title=Archive &#124;

There are around 42 independent power producers (IPPs) that contribute significantly in electricity generation in Pakistan.\n\n==History==\nPakistan electricity sector is a developing market. For years, the matter of balancing the country's supply against the demand for electricity had remained a largely unresolved matter. The country faced significant challenges in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity. Electricity generators were seeking a parity in returns for both domestic and foreign investors indicating it to be one of the key issues in overseeing a surge in electricity generation when the country was facing growing shortages. Other problems included lack of efficiency, rising demands for energy, and political instability.<ref>http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-loadshedding-to-end-by-next-summer-us-hs-06</ref> Provincial and federal agencies, who are the largest consumers, often do not pay their bills.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/05/pakistan%E2%80%99s-energy-crisis Power Politics:Pakistan's energy crisis] The Economist, 21 May 2012</ref> At one point electricity generation had shrunk by up to 50% due to an over-reliance on fossil fuels.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=90379|title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News|website=www.thenews.com.pk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> The country was hit by its worst power crisis in 2007 when production fell by 6000 Megawatts and massive blackouts followed suit.<ref name=\"etribune\">{{cite web|url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=864 |title=Pakistan's Ongoing Electricity Shortage |publisher=Energy Tribune |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> [[Rolling blackout|Load Shedding]] and power blackouts had become severe in Pakistan before 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pakistaniat.com/2008/01/03/more-crises-in-pakistan-electricity-flour-sugar-water-sui-gas-crises-what-is-the-way-out/ |title=More Crises in Pakistan: Electricity, Flour, Sugar, Water, Sui Gas Crises \u2013 What is the way out? : ALL THINGS PAKISTAN |publisher=Pakistaniat.com |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nEconomic Survey 2017-18 unfolds that Pakistan's installed capacity to generate electricity has surged up to 29,573MW by February 2018 which stood at 22,812MW in June 2013, showing the growth of 30 percent.<ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/309535-country-s-installed-electricity-capacity-increases-by-30pc-to-29-573mw</ref>\n\n==Installed capacity==\nPakistan's installed capacity to generate electricity has surged up to 33,836 MW by February 2019 which stood at 23,337 MW in 2014, showing the growth of 45 percent in five years.\n\n== Electricity Concerns ==\nAlthough Pakistan has reduced blackouts and increased electricity production significantly, blackouts are still common, and the price of electricity has still increased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/cpi|title=Monthly Price Indices (Base Year 2007-08) {{!}} Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|website=www.pbs.gov.pk|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> Recent tariff have contributed to this increase in prices.\n\n==Thermal==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The hydropower plants were retained by WAPDA as WAPDA Hydroelectric. All are\nfully owned by the government. K-Electric Limited (formally known as Karachi Electric Supply Company), which is responsible for power generation and distribution in the Karachi area, is\nlisted on the stock exchanges and is privately owned. Privately owned independent power producers generated 53% of the country's power in FY2016.<ref>Asian Development Bank (2016), Access to Clean Energy Investment Program, Energy Sector Summary, p.2</ref>\n\n==Effects of natural and man-made disasters==\nDuring [[2010 Pakistan floods]] and [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] power stations, power distribution and transmission and other energy infrastructures were damaged. During the floods and rainfalls the recently constructed Jinnah hydroelectric power plant was flooded in addition to severe damages to transmission and distribution network and installations while several power plants and refineries were threatened by rising waters and had to be shut down. Natural gas field output had to be reduced as the flood waters approached the wells. There has also been some concern by Pakistani nuclear activists over the effect of natural disasters on nuclear plants specially over the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]], since the plant lies over a geological fault.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/AL23Df01.html |title=Asia Times: Pakistan's nuclear program built on shifting sands |publisher=Atimes.com |date=23 December 1999 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\\story_16-9-2010_pg13_1 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |work=Daily Times|date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2009/01/31/local1.htm |title=Archive &#124;
