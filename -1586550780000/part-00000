It was released in 1992 as the fifth single from the album. It was written and composed by Jackson, and produced by Jackson and [[Bruce Swedien]].\n\nIn a 2001 [[Online chat|Internet chat]] with [[Fan (person)|fans]], Jackson said that \"Heal the World\" is the song he was most proud to have created. He also created the [[Heal the World Foundation]], a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the [[Dangerous World Tour]]. In the documentary ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at [[Neverland Ranch]].\n\nAn ensemble performance of \"[[We Are the World]]\" and \"Heal the World\" closed [[Michael Jackson memorial service|Jackson's memorial service]] at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"[[This Is It (concerts)|This Is It]]\" concerts in London along with \"[[Dirty Diana]]\". R&B singer [[Ciara]] sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the [[BET Awards|2009 BET Awards]].\n\nThe song was played at the funeral of [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]],<ref>Miles, Tina (October 8, 2009). {{cite web|url= http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/10/08/michael-jackson-s-heal-the-world-released-to-support-new-liverpool-james-bulger-centre-for-bullied-children-92534-24879959/ |title= Michael Jackson's Heal The World released to support new Liverpool James Bulger centre for bullied children |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016040814/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/10/08/michael-jackson-s-heal-the-world-released-to-support-new-liverpool-james-bulger-centre-for-bullied-children-92534-24879959/ |archivedate= October 16, 2009}}.

Jackson]] from his eighth studio album, ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991). It was released in 1992 as the fifth single from the album. It was written and composed by Jackson, and produced by Jackson and [[Bruce Swedien]].\n\nIn a 2001 [[Online chat|Internet chat]] with [[Fan (person)|fans]], Jackson said that \"Heal the World\" is the song he was most proud to have created. He also created the [[Heal the World Foundation]], a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the [[Dangerous World Tour]]. In the documentary ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at [[Neverland Ranch]].\n\nAn ensemble performance of \"[[We Are the World]]\" and \"Heal the World\" closed [[Michael Jackson memorial service|Jackson's memorial service]] at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"[[This Is It (concerts)|This Is It]]\" concerts in London along with \"[[Dirty Diana]]\". R&B singer [[Ciara]] sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the [[BET Awards|2009 BET Awards]].\n\nThe song was played at the funeral of [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]],<ref>Miles, Tina (October 8, 2009). {{cite web|url= http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/10/08/michael-jackson-s-heal-the-world-released-to-support-new-liverpool-james-bulger-centre-for-bullied-children-92534-24879959/ |title= Michael Jackson's Heal The World released to support new Liverpool James Bulger centre for bullied children |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016040814/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/10/08/michael-jackson-s-heal-the-world-released-to-support-new-liverpool-james-bulger-centre-for-bullied-children-92534-24879959/ |archivedate= October 16, 2009}}.

The Armenian demand to unify Karabakh with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, as the [[Soviet Union]]'s disintegration neared, the dispute gradually grew into a violent conflict between the ethnic groups in Nagorno-Karabakh, resulting in [[ethnic cleansing]] by all sides.<ref name=\"Case Study in Ethnic Strife. (Nagorno-Karabakh)\"/> The declaration of secession from Azerbaijan was the final result of the territorial conflict regarding the land.\n\nFollowing a [[UN Security Council]] resolution on April 6, 1993, calling for the immediate withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Azerbaijani district of [[Kelbajar]], Turkey joined Azerbaijan in imposing the full economic [[embargo]] on Armenia, and the border between the two states was closed.<ref name=\"Morris5\"/><ref name=\"Hale\"/> The border subsequently remained closed, as Turkey demanded The withdrawal of Armenia from [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and seven surrounding districts of Azerbaijan.

There is no doubt anymore.\u201d On the subject of gas prices, Erdo\u011fan stated, \u201cI cannot say that the price is fair.

This is an outright lie. I dismiss it once again here. Our stance on Nagorno-Karabakh is clear, and there has never been any deviation from this stance. We want the problem to be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. We have never taken any steps that could harm the national interests of Azerbaijan and will never take such steps. There will be no normalization unless the occupation of Azerbaijani territory ends.\u201d<ref name=TZ090514 />\n\nTurkish opposition parties responded positively to the visit with MHP Deputy Parliamentary Group Chairman Oktay Vural stating that, \u201cThe visit has been extremely positive because it reversed an erroneous policy.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ090516\"/>\n\nErdo\u011fan flew on to [[Sochi]], [[Russia]], for a 16 May \u201cworking visit\u201d with [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at which he stated, \u201cTurkey and Russia have responsibilities in the region. We have to take steps for the peace and well being of the region. This includes the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, the Middle East dispute, the Cyprus problem.\u201d Putin responded, \u201cRussia and Turkey seek for such problems to be resolved and will facilitate this in every way.... As for difficult problems from the past \u2013 and the Karabakh problem is among such issues \u2013 a compromise should be found by the participants in the conflict. Other states which help reach a compromise in this aspect can play a role of mediators and guarantors to implement the signed agreements.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ250409\"/><ref name=\"TZ090518\"/>\n\n===2009 Turkish foreign ministerial visit to Baku===\nSwiss Foreign Secretary Michael Amb\u00fchl updated Azerbaijani Foreign Minister [[Elmar Mammadyarov]], on the ongoing Armenian-Turkish normalisation negotiations, at an 18 May meeting in Baku. Mammadyarov stated, \u201cThe latest developments showed that it was impossible to achieve progress in the maintenance of stability and security in the region without taking Azerbaijan\u2019s position into consideration and without a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ090520\"/>\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Davuto\u011flu met with Mammadyarov on the sidelines of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers 23 May session in [[Damascus]], with Davuto\u011flu subsequently announcing, \"We will head to Baku together on board the same plane. This has turned out to be something like \u2018one state, two nations\u2019; \u2018one nation, two delegations\u2019.... It is not possible to disagree with [Azerbaijani President] Aliyev's remarks concerning the performance of the Minsk Group.

Turkey will continue its efforts.\" <ref name=\"TZ090525\"/><ref name=\"TZ090526\"/>\n\nDavuto\u011flu announced, at a 26 May joint press conference in Baku, \u201cTurkey and Azerbaijan are not two ordinary friend, neighbour and brother countries, they are at the same time two strategic partners. One of the fundamental foreign policy priorities which is embraced by everybody in Turkey \u2013 no matter what political thought [they] have \u2013 is the existing strategic partnership with Azerbaijan.... Our message intended for actors in the region, particularly intended for Armenia, is very open and clear. The region should now be cleansed of occupation, stresses and high tension.\u201d Mammadyarov added, \u201cWe also discussed cooperation in the fields of energy, economy and culture. Our countries have signed around 150 documents in total, but we don\u2019t have to stop at what has been achieved.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ090527\"/>\n\n===Failure and cancellation of proposed Turkey-Azerbaijan visa-free regime===\nAzerbaijan agreed to a visa-free regime with [[Turkey]] while [[Iran]] also demanded the same visa-free regime with Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijani diplomats also said the national interests of Azerbaijan did not allow for an open-border policy with Iran since political instability in Iran may trigger a huge influx of Iranian ethnic [[Azeri people|Azeris]] refugees to Azerbaijan and did not want the proposed Turkey-Azerbaijan Visa Free Regime to be reciprocal with Iran as well.<ref name=\"todayszaman\"/> Azerbaijan lifted visa requirements for Turkish citizens from 1 September 2019.\n\n====Strategic partnership====\nOn June 2010, Azerbaijan and Turkey have signed key agreement on a package of Shah Deniz gas issues in Istanbul.<ref name=\"cacianalyst\"/><ref name=\"news\"/> The agreement also will open the way for securing supplies to the EU's flagship [[Nabucco pipeline|Nabucco]] gas pipeline project.<ref name=\"ihsglobalinsight\"/> On 16 September 2010, countries signed a treaty to establish Strategic Cooperation Council in [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Azerbaijan, Turkey To Sign Treaty To Establish Strategic Cooperation Council Today\"/><ref name=\"Turkey, Azerbaijan establish Strategic Cooperation Council\"/> In December 2010, [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] ratified on [[The Agreement on Strategic Partnership and Mutual Support|strategic partnership and mutual assistance]] between Azerbaijan and Turkey.<ref name=\"establishment\"/><ref name=\"regnum\"/> The agreement consists of 23 articles and five chapters: Military-political and security issues, military and military-technical cooperation, humanitarian issues, economic cooperation, and common and final provisions.<ref name=\"Azerbaijani Parliament Ratifies Azeri-Turkish Defense Pact\"/><ref name=\"dikkathaber\"/>\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on a written statement that the [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria]] will serve to eliminate the terror risks, return of the refugees to their homes, solution of the humanitarian problems and providing peace and stability within the territorial integrity of [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Azerbaijani MFA released statement on military operations conducted by Turkey Army in Northern Syria |url=https://apa.az/en/foreign-news/azerbaijani-mfa-released-statement-on-military-operations-conducted-by-turkey-army-in-north-syria-294707 |agency=apa.az |date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Republic of Azerbaijan\n*[[Ankara]] (Embassy)\n*[[Istanbul]] (Consulate-General)\n*[[Kars]] (Consulate-General)\n{{col-2}}\n;Republic of Turkey\n*[[Baku]] (Embassy)\n*[[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhcivan]] (Consulate-General)\n*[[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] (Consulate-General)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Azerbaijan|Turkey}}\n* [[The Agreement on Strategic Partnership and Mutual Support]]\n* [[Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan relations]]\n* [[Armenia\u2013Turkey relations]]\n* [[Azerbaijan\u2013Turkey border]]\n* [[Azerbaijanis in Turkey]]\n* [[Eurasianism]]\n* [[Turanism]]\n* [[Turkic Council]]\n* [[Turks in Azerbaijan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\" Libaridian\">{{cite book |url= |chapterurl= |chapter= |accessdate= |author=Libaridian, Gerard J. |title=[[Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State]] |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |date= |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernarmeniapeo00liba/page/245 245] |location= |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7658-0205-7 |authorlink=Gerard J.

Other states which help reach a compromise in this aspect can play a role of mediators and guarantors to implement the signed agreements.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ250409\"/><ref name=\"TZ090518\"/>\n\n===2009 Turkish foreign ministerial visit to Baku===\nSwiss Foreign Secretary Michael Amb\u00fchl updated Azerbaijani Foreign Minister [[Elmar Mammadyarov]], on the ongoing Armenian-Turkish normalisation negotiations, at an 18 May meeting in Baku. Mammadyarov stated, \u201cThe latest developments showed that it was impossible to achieve progress in the maintenance of stability and security in the region without taking Azerbaijan\u2019s position into consideration and without a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ090520\"/>\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Davuto\u011flu met with Mammadyarov on the sidelines of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers 23 May session in [[Damascus]], with Davuto\u011flu subsequently announcing, \"We will head to Baku together on board the same plane. This has turned out to be something like \u2018one state, two nations\u2019; \u2018one nation, two delegations\u2019.... It is not possible to disagree with [Azerbaijani President] Aliyev's remarks concerning the performance of the Minsk Group. Because no progress has been made, it is now necessary to rescue this issue from being in the status of a frozen conflict. Turkey will continue its efforts.\" <ref name=\"TZ090525\"/><ref name=\"TZ090526\"/>\n\nDavuto\u011flu announced, at a 26 May joint press conference in Baku, \u201cTurkey and Azerbaijan are not two ordinary friend, neighbour and brother countries, they are at the same time two strategic partners. One of the fundamental foreign policy priorities which is embraced by everybody in Turkey \u2013 no matter what political thought [they] have \u2013 is the existing strategic partnership with Azerbaijan.... Our message intended for actors in the region, particularly intended for Armenia, is very open and clear. The region should now be cleansed of occupation, stresses and high tension.\u201d Mammadyarov added, \u201cWe also discussed cooperation in the fields of energy, economy and culture. Our countries have signed around 150 documents in total, but we don\u2019t have to stop at what has been achieved.\u201d<ref name=\"TZ090527\"/>\n\n===Failure and cancellation of proposed Turkey-Azerbaijan visa-free regime===\nAzerbaijan agreed to a visa-free regime with [[Turkey]] while [[Iran]] also demanded the same visa-free regime with Azerbaijan. [[Iran]] had threatened to cut off the critical supply line between Azerbaijan and the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] if Azerbaijan lifted visa requirements for Turkish citizens but not extend the same privilege to Iranian citizens.<ref name=\"azerireport\"/> According to Azerbaijani diplomats, a visa-free travel regime proposed by Turkey in 2009 had fallen victim to Iranian pressure on Azerbaijan, prompting the last minute cancellation of the deal between Baku and Ankara. Azerbaijani diplomats also said the national interests of Azerbaijan did not allow for an open-border policy with Iran since political instability in Iran may trigger a huge influx of Iranian ethnic [[Azeri people|Azeris]] refugees to Azerbaijan and did not want the proposed Turkey-Azerbaijan Visa Free Regime to be reciprocal with Iran as well.<ref name=\"todayszaman\"/> Azerbaijan lifted visa requirements for Turkish citizens from 1 September 2019.\n\n====Strategic partnership====\nOn June 2010, Azerbaijan and Turkey have signed key agreement on a package of Shah Deniz gas issues in Istanbul.<ref name=\"cacianalyst\"/><ref name=\"news\"/> The agreement also will open the way for securing supplies to the EU's flagship [[Nabucco pipeline|Nabucco]] gas pipeline project.<ref name=\"ihsglobalinsight\"/> On 16 September 2010, countries signed a treaty to establish Strategic Cooperation Council in [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Azerbaijan, Turkey To Sign Treaty To Establish Strategic Cooperation Council Today\"/><ref name=\"Turkey, Azerbaijan establish Strategic Cooperation Council\"/> In December 2010, [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] ratified on [[The Agreement on Strategic Partnership and Mutual Support|strategic partnership and mutual assistance]] between Azerbaijan and Turkey.<ref name=\"establishment\"/><ref name=\"regnum\"/> The agreement consists of 23 articles and five chapters: Military-political and security issues, military and military-technical cooperation, humanitarian issues, economic cooperation, and common and final provisions.<ref name=\"Azerbaijani Parliament Ratifies Azeri-Turkish Defense Pact\"/><ref name=\"dikkathaber\"/>\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on a written statement that the [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria]] will serve to eliminate the terror risks, return of the refugees to their homes, solution of the humanitarian problems and providing peace and stability within the territorial integrity of [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Azerbaijani MFA released statement on military operations conducted by Turkey Army in Northern Syria |url=https://apa.az/en/foreign-news/azerbaijani-mfa-released-statement-on-military-operations-conducted-by-turkey-army-in-north-syria-294707 |agency=apa.az |date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Republic of Azerbaijan\n*[[Ankara]] (Embassy)\n*[[Istanbul]] (Consulate-General)\n*[[Kars]] (Consulate-General)\n{{col-2}}\n;Republic of Turkey\n*[[Baku]] (Embassy)\n*[[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhcivan]] (Consulate-General)\n*[[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] (Consulate-General)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Azerbaijan|Turkey}}\n* [[Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan relations]]\n* [[Armenia\u2013Turkey relations]]\n* [[Azerbaijan\u2013Georgia relations]] \n* [[Georgia\u2013Turkey relations]] \n* [[Azerbaijanis in Turkey]]\n* [[Turks in Azerbaijan]]\n* [[Turkic Council]]\n* [[The Agreement on Strategic Partnership and Mutual Support]]\n* [[Eurasianism]]\n* [[Turanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\" Libaridian\">{{cite book |url= |chapterurl= |chapter= |accessdate= |author=Libaridian, Gerard J. |title=[[Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State]] |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |date= |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernarmeniapeo00liba/page/245 245] |location= |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7658-0205-7 |authorlink=Gerard J.
