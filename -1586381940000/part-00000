J. Walsh was born in the [[townland]] of Rathroon, near [[Bandon, County Cork]]. His family came from a farming background, \"working a substantial holding of medium but well-cultivated land\".<ref name=\"Walsh p9\">Walsh p9</ref> Until the age of fifteen, Walsh attended a local school in Bandon, but by his own account \"as far as learning went, I may as well have been at home\".<ref name=\"Walsh p9\"/> Together with his school-friend [[P. S. O'Hegarty]], he passed the Civil Service exams for the Postal service. He later worked locally as a clerk in the Post Office. Like O'Hegarty, he spent three years in London at [[King's College London|King's College]], studying for the Secretary's Office \"a syllabus (which) differed little from the [[Indian Civil Service]]\". While O'Hegarty succeeded in his studies, Walsh did not, and returned to Cork where a friend, Sir Edward Fitzgerald, arranged work for him on the Entertainments Committee of the [[Cork International Exhibition (1902)|Cork International Exhibition]].<ref>Walsh p10</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nWalsh was active in the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], promoting [[Gaelic games]] in many areas, but particularly in Cork city and county. His interest in organised sports had a strong political dimension.<blockquote>\n I happened to be one of those who realised the potentialities of the G.A.A. as a training ground for Physical Force. Contamination with the alien and all his works was taboo. I gathered around me a force of youthful enthusiasts from the University, Civil Service and Business.

J. Walsh was born in the [[townland]] of Rathroon, near [[Bandon, County Cork]]. His family came from a farming background, \"working a substantial holding of medium but well-cultivated land\".<ref name=\"Walsh p9\">Walsh p9</ref> Until the age of fifteen, Walsh attended a local school in Bandon, but by his own account \"as far as learning went, I may as well have been at home\".<ref name=\"Walsh p9\"/> Together with his school-friend [[P. S. O'Hegarty]], he passed the Civil Service exams for the Postal service. He later worked locally as a clerk in the Post Office. Like O'Hegarty, he spent three years in London at [[King's College London|King's College]], studying for the Secretary's Office \"a syllabus (which) differed little from the [[Indian Civil Service]]\". While O'Hegarty succeeded in his studies, Walsh did not, and returned to Cork where a friend, Sir Edward Fitzgerald, arranged work for him on the Entertainments Committee of the [[Cork International Exhibition (1902)|Cork International Exhibition]].<ref>Walsh p10</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nWalsh was active in the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], promoting [[Gaelic games]] in many areas, but particularly in Cork city and county.
