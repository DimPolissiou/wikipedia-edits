After meeting their new neighbors and settling into their jobs, they decide to adopt a child. Although they are married, no country is willing to let a gay couple adopt any of its children. After initially being turned down by the adoption agency, a Swedish orphan becomes available, whom they readily agree to adopt. However, a typographical error on the papers changed the child's age from \"1.5\" to \"15\". When their new son Patrik ([[Tom Ljungman]]) arrives, they are shocked to find him a troubled teenager with a criminal background.\n\nHurrying to the adoption agency to rectify the error, they arrive to find there is nothing that can be done until the next week. Over the next few days, Sven is appalled by Patrik's insulting behavior, even though G\u00f6ran sees the good in him. Patrik is initially fearful of both men, believing stereotypes that gays are pedophiles.  Once the agency reopens, all three are told by the officials that Patrik's only options are living with them or returning to the foster center where he came from. After living up to his troublemaking habits, Patrik causes Sven to leave in disgust over G\u00f6ran's unwillingness to kick Patrik out. G\u00f6ran agrees to look after Patrik until the agency can find a suitable home for him. Over the next few days, Patrik reveals his talent for gardening, and G\u00f6ran grows to accept him.\n\nAfter several weeks, the agency notifies G\u00f6ran that a family has been found for Patrik, who by this time has gotten past his initial fear and contempt for his surrogate parents. Sven returns as he and G\u00f6ran both realize their issues were not worth ending their relationship. Patrik's new father arrives to pick him up, and he leaves with him. After a short time, Patrik returns, and the three then live together permanently.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as G\u00f6ran Skoogh \n* [[Torkel Petersson]] as Sven Skoogh \n* [[Tom Ljungman]] as Patrik \n* [[Anders L\u00f6nnbro]] as Urban Adler\n\n==Release==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe film was shown at the 2008 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref name=variety>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938339.html?categoryid=2863&cs=1 |title=Patrik, Age 1.5 Movie Review From The Toronto Film Festival |magazine=Variety |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2009 | first=Dennis | last=Harvey}}</ref> and the 2009 [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].

It was the closing film at the Dublin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (GAZE) in August 2009 and at the Glasgay! Film Festival in October 2009. Also screened at the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and the Rehoboth Beach Film Festival (where it placed 3rd for Best Feature) in November 2009, and at the 25th Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in early December 2009, where a discussion was held with director Ella Lemhagen after the sold-out (closing) screening at the Slovenian Cinematheque.\n\n==Production==\nPatrik, Age 1.5 is technically based on a stage production; however, director Ella Lemhagen didn't like the script of the play all that much, and decided to just use the film's pitch and to build up a new story from scratch.

The film is about an aging man coming to terms with his homosexuality and mortality.  It was a pioneer in its frank and mature examination of homosexuality.\n\n==Plot ==\nJos\u00e9, a middle age magician, is an elegant discreet homosexual who lives alone and has an occasional affair with Miguel, a young politician who finds it more convenient in Madrid's high society to marry than assert his homosexuality. Jos\u00e9 is a man romantically possessed and obsessed by his childhood in [[Granada]] during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the spring of 1936.\n\nNow in his fifties, Jos\u00e9 returns to Granada and relives his childhood there. A time when he fell in love with [[Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and had a youthful affair with one of Lorca's own lovers. Memories come flooding back to the mature Jos\u00e9, of youthful sexual conquest, of Lorca's murder at the hands of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s agents, and his own early homosexual affairs. Jos\u00e9's entire life is colored by his obsessions with Garc\u00eda Lorca, his unknown God, to whom the film is dedicated.\n\nJos\u00e9 travels twice to Granada. First, he revisits a woman who is also obsessed with Garc\u00eda Lorca's memory, and steals a photograph of the boy with whom he had his first sexual encounter; later, Jos\u00e9 returns to Madrid, to a party in search of his youth, and meets a pianist with whom he had sexual relations many years before but now does not remember.\n\nWhen Jos\u00e9 returns to Madrid, he is a man tormented by his past, and in search of peace. Listening to a taped recording of Garc\u00eda Lorca's famous \"Ode to [[Walt Whitman]]\", he desires nothing more than to face the rest of his life in loneliness, although his recent lover, Miguel has returned to his bed and wants to continue their affair.
