In the 1990s, Singer engineered the [[Porsche]] [[Porsche WSC-95|WSC]] open sports car which claimed two victories in [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|1996 and 1997]], and finally oversaw the [[Porsche 911 GT1]]-98 project which achieved [[Porsche]]'s 16th win, the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Following that, Porsche retired from Le Mans racing to develop a new car, but they ultimately decided to focus on the [[Porsche Cayenne]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.24hours16wins.com/ 24:16 - Le Mans 24 Hours : 16 Wins With Porsche : An Autobiography with Michael Cotton]\n* [http://jackcriswell.powweb.com/singer/ The Norbert Singer Fan Club]\n* [http://www.mulsannescorner.com/porschelmp1.html late 1990s Porsche LMP]\n\n{{Porsche vehicles}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singer, Norbert}}\n[[Category:1939 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Cheb]]\n[[Category:People from Sudetenland]]\n[[Category:German automotive engineers]]\n[[Category:Porsche people]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans]]\n[[Category:Technical University of Munich alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Galopujacyjez", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Singer"}

Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to [[Herodotus]], embalmed their dead. Early [[Persia]]ns practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the [[Zoroastrian]] Period. [[Phoenicia]]ns practiced both cremation and burial. From the [[Cycladic civilisation]] in 3000 BCE until the Sub-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] era in 1200\u20131100 BCE, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] practiced inhumation. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, constituting a new practice of burial, probably influenced by [[Anatolia]]. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic|title=IMS-FORTH: About IMS|website=Ims.forth.gr|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> [[Roman Empire|Romans]] practiced both, with cremation the rule until the later imperial period.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early [[Bronze Age]] (c. 2000 BCE) in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the middle [[Danube]]. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the [[Urnfield culture]] (from c. 1300 BCE). In the [[Iron Age]], [[inhumation]] again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the [[Villanovan culture]] and elsewhere. [[Homer]]'s account of [[Patroclus]]' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a [[tumulus]], similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.\n\n[[File:The Funeral Rites of Auitzotl WDL6755.png|thumbnail|The [[Aztec]] emperor [[Ahuitzotl]] being cremated.

Cremation in India is first attested in the [[Cemetery H culture]] (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the formative stage of [[Vedic civilization]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers \"both cremated (''agnidagdh\u00e1-'') and uncremated (''\u00e1nagnidagdha-'')\" are invoked.\n\nCremation remained common but not universal, in both [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]. According to [[Cicero]], in Rome, inhumation was considered the more archaic rite.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe rise of [[Christianity]] saw an end to cremation in Europe, though it may have already been in decline.<ref name=\"guardian-15\">{{cite news|title=The burning question \u2013 How cremation became our last act of self-determination |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/burning-question-how-cremation-became-last-great-act-self-determination-thomas-laqueur|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2015|accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref> This stance was  influenced by its roots in Judaism, the belief in the resurrection of the body, and the example of Christ's burial.

It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the [[pyre]], and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an \"urn cemetery\". The custom again died out with the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the 7th century, when Christian burial became general.<ref>S.J.

His furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in [[Dresden]]. The radical politician, Sir [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]], took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMOuJm345vsC|title=Between Mass Death And Individual Loss: The Place of the Dead in Twentieth-Century Germany|author1=Alon Confino |author2=Paul Betts |author3=Dirk Schumann |year=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=94}}</ref>\n\nThe first crematorium in the Western World opened in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1876.

Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the [[West Terrace Cemetery]] in the [[South Australia]]n capital of [[Adelaide]] in 1901.

These furnaces, based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators, instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor, with the help of a draft fan located at the far end of the structure. Once outside, the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney, most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself, nor had a visible duct leading into it.\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn the 20th century, cremation gained varying degrees of acceptance in most Christian denominations. [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]], the most senior bishop in the [[Church of England]], was cremated after his death in office in 1944. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] accepted the practice more slowly. In 1963, at the [[Second Vatican Council]] [[Pope Paul VI]] lifted the ban on cremation,<ref name=\"kohmescher\">{{cite book| last = Kohmescher| first = Matthew F.| title = Catholicism Today: A Survey of Catholic Belief and Practice| year = 1999| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 0-8091-3873-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/catholicismtoday0000kohm_z7d7/page/178 178\u2013179]| url = https://archive.org/details/catholicismtoday0000kohm_z7d7/page/178}}</ref> and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to [[officiate]] at cremation ceremonies. This is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred, not scattered. Many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant, if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body.

When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.\n\nThe appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ''ashes'', although a non-technical term sometimes used is \"cremains\",<ref name=Carlson80/><ref name=Sublette/> a [[portmanteau]] of \"cremated\" and \"remains\". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word \"cremains\" not be used for referring to \"human cremated remains\". The reason given is that \"cremains\" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's \"cremated remains\" has a more identifiable human connection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=AboutCANA|title=Cremation Association of North America \u2013 About CANA|year=2008|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>)\n\nAfter final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative [[urn]]. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.\n\nAn unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.\n\n=== Ash weight and composition ===\n[[File:Human cremains.jpg|thumb|Cremated human remains still in plastic bag]]\nCremated remains are mostly dry [[calcium phosphates]] with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about [https://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/cremation-science-memorial-diamonds-052634/ 1% -4% of carbon remain]s as carbonate.\n\nThe ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.\n\nAshes of adults can be said to weigh from {{cvt|876|to|3784|g|lboz|-1}}, with women's ashes generally weighing below {{cvt|2750|g|lboz|-1}} and men's ashes generally weighing above {{cvt|1887|g|lboz|-1}}.<ref name=\"Warren, M; Maples, W (1997)\">{{cite journal| last=Warren| first=M|author2=Maples, W| title=The anthropometry of contemporary commercial cremation| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=42| issue=3| pages=417\u2013423| year=1997| pmid=9144931| doi=10.1520/JFS14141J}}</ref>\n\nNot all that remains is bone.

Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous [[scrap metal]]. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as ''gleanings'') are sieved out and may be later interred in common, [[consecrate]]d ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.\n\n== Methods of retaining or disposing of the cremated remains ==\n[[File:US Navy 030501-N-6141B-022 Officers ^ sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG 75).jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy sailor scatters cremated remains at sea. Visible is the clear plastic inner bag containing the remains, and next to it the labeled black plastic box that contained the inner bag. This is normal in American packaging.]]\nCremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight [[polyethylene]] [[plastic bag]] contained within a hard snap-top rectangular [[plastic container]], which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.\n\nCremated remains can be kept in an [[urn]], stored in a special memorial building ([[columbarium]]), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or [[Burial at sea|in the sea]]. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat<ref name=\"Scattering Ashes by boat\">{{cite web|title=Scattering Ashes by boat|url=http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/private-hire/ashes-scattering|publisher=FrenchBrothersLtd|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies<ref>{{cite web |title=Eterneva \u2013 Diamonds from Ashes |url=https://www.eterneva.com/ |website=Eterneva}}</ref> offer a service to turn part of the [[Memorial diamond|cremated remains into synthetic diamonds]] which can then be made into jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-the-dead-into-diamonds-meet-the-ghoul-jewelers_us_57ab1021e4b08c46f0e45afd|title=Turning The Dead into Diamonds: Meet The Ghoul Jewelers of Switzerland|first=Brian|last=Roberts|date=10 August 2016|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nCremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122320/http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}</ref> and glass orbs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Spirit Pieces Memorial Glass Orbs with Cremation Ashes|url = http://www.spiritpieces.com|website = Spirit Pieces Memorials|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}</ref> The cremated remains may also be entombed.

Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river [[Ganges]], preferably at the holy city of [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], or [[Varanasi]] or [[Haridwar]], India. The [[Sikhs]] immerse the remains in [[Sutlej]], usually at [[Sri Harkiratpur]]. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river [[Kaveri]] at Paschima vahini in [[Srirangapattana]] at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.{{further|Japanese funeral|Cremation in Japan}}\n\n==Reasons for choosing cremation==\n[[File:Helsinki-cemetery-mini-gravestones-1841.JPG|thumb|left|Cremation allows for very economical use of cemetery space. Mini-gravestones in [[Helsinki]].]]\nAside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some;<ref name=\"aiken\">{{cite book| last = Aiken| first = Lewis R.| title = Dying, Death, and Bereavement| year = 2000| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn = 0-8058-3504-0| pages = 131 }}</ref> many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.<ref name=\"sublette-p53\">Sublette & Flagg, p. 53</ref>\n\nOther people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://safepassageurns.com/blogs/blog/5-reasons-why-you-should-choose-cremation|title=5 Reasons Why You Should Choose Cremation|work=Safe Passage Urns|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service,<ref name=\"NCRC\">{{cite web|title=Average Cost of Cremation|url=http://cremationresearch.org/average-cost-of-cremation/|website=National Cremation Research Council|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.\n\nFor surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.\n\nCremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or [[columbarium]] niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (\u00a336 to incumbent and \u00a378 to church council) a total of \u00a3114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked\u2014such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as [[space burial]] and offered by companies such as [[Elysium Space]], [[Celestis]] and Ascending Memories). Cremated remains can now also be converted to [[diamond]]s.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nDespite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation also has [[natural environment|environmental]] advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ([[natural burial]] was not addressed), while the newer method of [[alkaline hydrolysis (body disposal)|alkaline hydrolysis]] (sometimes called ''green cremation'' or ''resomation'') had less impact than both. The study was based off Dutch practices; American crematoria are more likely to emit [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> Keijzer's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral's environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/dissolving_the_dead|title=Dissolving the dead: Alkaline hydrolysis, a new alternative to | date=22 May 2017|accessdate=4 January 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nEach cremation requires about {{cvt|28|usgal|L|order=flip}} of fuel and releases about {{cvt|540|lbs|kg|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about {{cvt|270,000|short ton|t|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide, which is more CO<sub>2</sub> pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/29/11775976/natural-green-burial|title=A different way to die: the story of a natural burial|last=Herzog|first=Katie|date=29 May 2016|work=|access-date=29 May 2016|via=}}</ref> The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating on the same day as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions.

Cremation can also release contaminants, such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[Dental restoration|dental fillings]].<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.\n\nAnother environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a [[concrete]] vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns.

The [[Roman catacombs]] and veneration of [[relics]] of [[saint]]s witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.<ref>Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of ''Summa Theologiae'', says that Aquinas is \"...quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato [...] which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on,\" and that Aquinas believed that \"we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being.\" See {{cite book| last = Aquinas| first = St. Thomas| others = trans.

See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108.</ref> And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in [[Medieval Europe]], cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a [[battle]], after a [[Epidemic|pestilence]] or [[famine]], and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.\n\nBeginning in the [[Middle Ages]], and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,<ref>Prothero, p. 74-75</ref> although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.<ref name=\"prothero-p74\">Prothero, p. 74.</ref> Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with \"professed enemies of God.\"<ref name=\"prothero-p74\" /> When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the [[Holy See]] forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban, but in 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in many circumstances.<ref name=McNamara>[Edward McNamara, \"Mixing Ashes of the Dead\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rkdocumenten.nl/rkdocs/index.php?mi=600&doc=4933|title=Piam et constantem \u2013 Over de crematie \u2013 RKDocumenten.nl|website=Rkdocumenten.nl|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> The current [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], states: \"The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of burial be retained; but it does not forbid cremation, unless this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1176 \u00a73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008214742/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM |date=8 October 2014 }}; cf.

There is a beautiful symbolism in it.  The whole terminology of eschatology presupposes it.  Cremation is purely heathenish.  It was the practice among the Greeks and Romans.  The mass of the Hindoos thus dispose of their dead.  It is dishonoring to the body, intended for a temple of the Holy Ghost and to bear the image of God.

Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to [[Herodotus]], embalmed their dead. Early [[Persia]]ns practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the [[Zoroastrian]] Period. [[Phoenicia]]ns practiced both cremation and burial. From the [[Cycladic civilisation]] in 3000 BCE until the Sub-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] era in 1200\u20131100 BCE, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] practiced inhumation. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, constituting a new practice of burial, probably influenced by [[Anatolia]]. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic|title=IMS-FORTH: About IMS|website=Ims.forth.gr|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> [[Roman Empire|Romans]] practiced both, with cremation the rule until the later imperial period.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early [[Bronze Age]] (c. 2000 BCE) in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the middle [[Danube]]. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the [[Urnfield culture]] (from c. 1300 BCE). In the [[Iron Age]], [[inhumation]] again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the [[Villanovan culture]] and elsewhere. [[Homer]]'s account of [[Patroclus]]' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a [[tumulus]], similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.\n\n[[File:The Funeral Rites of Auitzotl WDL6755.png|thumbnail|The [[Aztec]] emperor [[Ahuitzotl]] being cremated.

Cremation in India is first attested in the [[Cemetery H culture]] (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the formative stage of [[Vedic civilization]].

It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the [[pyre]], and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period.

His furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in [[Dresden]]. The radical politician, Sir [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]], took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMOuJm345vsC|title=Between Mass Death And Individual Loss: The Place of the Dead in Twentieth-Century Germany|author1=Alon Confino |author2=Paul Betts |author3=Dirk Schumann |year=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=94}}</ref>\n\nThe first crematorium in the Western World opened in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1876.

When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.\n\nThe appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ''ashes'', although a non-technical term sometimes used is \"cremains\",<ref name=Carlson80/><ref name=Sublette/> a [[portmanteau]] of \"cremated\" and \"remains\". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word \"cremains\" not be used for referring to \"human cremated remains\". The reason given is that \"cremains\" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's \"cremated remains\" has a more identifiable human connection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=AboutCANA|title=Cremation Association of North America \u2013 About CANA|year=2008|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>)\n\nAfter final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative [[urn]]. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.\n\nAn unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.\n\n=== Ash weight and composition ===\n[[File:Human cremains.jpg|thumb|Cremated human remains still in plastic bag]]\nCremated remains are mostly dry [[calcium phosphates]] with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about [https://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/cremation-science-memorial-diamonds-052634/ 1% -4% of carbon remain]s as carbonate.\n\nThe ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.\n\nAshes of adults can be said to weigh from {{cvt|876|to|3784|g|lboz|-1}}, with women's ashes generally weighing below {{cvt|2750|g|lboz|-1}} and men's ashes generally weighing above {{cvt|1887|g|lboz|-1}}.<ref name=\"Warren, M; Maples, W (1997)\">{{cite journal| last=Warren| first=M|author2=Maples, W| title=The anthropometry of contemporary commercial cremation| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=42| issue=3| pages=417\u2013423| year=1997| pmid=9144931| doi=10.1520/JFS14141J}}</ref>\n\nNot all that remains is bone.

Eisenberg, \u2018\u2019The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths,\u2019\u2019 Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9857249-3-1}}</ref> Some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous [[scrap metal]]. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as ''gleanings'') are sieved out and may be later interred in common, [[consecrate]]d ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.\n\n== Methods of retaining or disposing of the cremated remains ==\n[[File:US Navy 030501-N-6141B-022 Officers ^ sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG 75).jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy sailor scatters cremated remains at sea. Visible is the clear plastic inner bag containing the remains, and next to it the labeled black plastic box that contained the inner bag. This is normal in American packaging.]]\nCremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight [[polyethylene]] [[plastic bag]] contained within a hard snap-top rectangular [[plastic container]], which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.\n\nCremated remains can be kept in an [[urn]], stored in a special memorial building ([[columbarium]]), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or [[Burial at sea|in the sea]]. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat<ref name=\"Scattering Ashes by boat\">{{cite web|title=Scattering Ashes by boat|url=http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/private-hire/ashes-scattering|publisher=FrenchBrothersLtd|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies<ref>{{cite web |title=Eterneva \u2013 Diamonds from Ashes |url=https://www.eterneva.com/ |website=Eterneva}}</ref> offer a service to turn part of the [[Memorial diamond|cremated remains into synthetic diamonds]] which can then be made into jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-the-dead-into-diamonds-meet-the-ghoul-jewelers_us_57ab1021e4b08c46f0e45afd|title=Turning The Dead into Diamonds: Meet The Ghoul Jewelers of Switzerland|first=Brian|last=Roberts|date=10 August 2016|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nCremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122320/http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}</ref> and glass orbs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Spirit Pieces Memorial Glass Orbs with Cremation Ashes|url = http://www.spiritpieces.com|website = Spirit Pieces Memorials|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}</ref> The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.\n\nConcerns have been raised at the amount of ashes scattered at the peak of [[Snowdon]], as they change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dont-scatter-ashes-snowdon-2359993|title=(Don't) scatter my ashes on Snowdon|first=Rhodri|last=Clark|date=26 January 2006|website=Walesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river [[Ganges]], preferably at the holy city of [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], or [[Varanasi]] or [[Haridwar]], India. The [[Sikhs]] immerse the remains in [[Sutlej]], usually at [[Sri Harkiratpur]]. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river [[Kaveri]] at Paschima vahini in [[Srirangapattana]] at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.{{further|Japanese funeral|Cremation in Japan}}\n\n==Reasons for choosing cremation==\n[[File:Helsinki-cemetery-mini-gravestones-1841.JPG|thumb|left|Cremation allows for very economical use of cemetery space. Mini-gravestones in [[Helsinki]].]]\nAside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some;<ref name=\"aiken\">{{cite book| last = Aiken| first = Lewis R.| title = Dying, Death, and Bereavement| year = 2000| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn = 0-8058-3504-0| pages = 131 }}</ref> many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.<ref name=\"sublette-p53\">Sublette & Flagg, p. 53</ref>\n\nOther people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://safepassageurns.com/blogs/blog/5-reasons-why-you-should-choose-cremation|title=5 Reasons Why You Should Choose Cremation|work=Safe Passage Urns|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service,<ref name=\"NCRC\">{{cite web|title=Average Cost of Cremation|url=http://cremationresearch.org/average-cost-of-cremation/|website=National Cremation Research Council|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.\n\nFor surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.\n\nCremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or [[columbarium]] niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (\u00a336 to incumbent and \u00a378 to church council) a total of \u00a3114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked\u2014such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as [[space burial]] and offered by companies such as [[Elysium Space]], [[Celestis]] and Ascending Memories). Cremated remains can now also be converted to [[diamond]]s.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nDespite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation also has [[natural environment|environmental]] advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ([[natural burial]] was not addressed), while the newer method of [[alkaline hydrolysis (body disposal)|alkaline hydrolysis]] (sometimes called ''green cremation'' or ''resomation'') had less impact than both. The study was based off Dutch practices; American crematoria are more likely to emit [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> Keijzer's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral's environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/dissolving_the_dead|title=Dissolving the dead: Alkaline hydrolysis, a new alternative to | date=22 May 2017|accessdate=4 January 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nEach cremation requires about {{cvt|28|usgal|L|order=flip}} of fuel and releases about {{cvt|540|lbs|kg|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about {{cvt|270,000|short ton|t|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide, which is more CO<sub>2</sub> pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/29/11775976/natural-green-burial|title=A different way to die: the story of a natural burial|last=Herzog|first=Katie|date=29 May 2016|work=|access-date=29 May 2016|via=}}</ref> The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating on the same day as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions.

Cremation can also release contaminants, such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[Dental restoration|dental fillings]].<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.\n\nAnother environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a [[concrete]] vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns.

The [[Roman catacombs]] and veneration of [[relics]] of [[saint]]s witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.<ref>Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of ''Summa Theologiae'', says that Aquinas is \"...quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato [...] which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on,\" and that Aquinas believed that \"we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being.\" See {{cite book| last = Aquinas| first = St. Thomas| others = trans.

See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108.</ref> And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in [[Medieval Europe]], cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a [[battle]], after a [[Epidemic|pestilence]] or [[famine]], and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.\n\nBeginning in the [[Middle Ages]], and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,<ref>Prothero, p. 74-75</ref> although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.<ref name=\"prothero-p74\">Prothero, p. 74.</ref> Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with \"professed enemies of God.\"<ref name=\"prothero-p74\" /> When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the [[Holy See]] forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886.

It works by adding a [[digital certificate]] to the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] information used to initiate and route calls in VOIP systems. The first public connection on the system, typically the VOIP service provider, examines the caller ID and compares it to a known list of IDs they provide to that customer. The provider then attaches an encrypted certificate to the SIP header with the service provider's identity and a trust value. VOIP software on the receiving end can check the authenticity of the message by decrypting STIR using the provider's [[public key]].\n\nFor non-VOIP systems, like [[cell phone]]s and [[landline]]s, call routing information is carried by [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]]. In these cases, the SIP header is not directly useful as it cannot be sent to users unless they are on a VOIP connection.

SIP borrowed from existing protocols, including the use of simple headers like \"From:\" in a format similar to the [[SMTP]] email system.

A company with several of these systems in separate offices could forward the call to the one closest to the number being dialed, thereby reducing or eliminating [[Long-distance calling|long distance]] charges.{{sfn|SIP}}\n\nAs these systems became popular, new telephony providers emerged that offered centralized SIP routing, allowing both companies and end-users to use VOIP systems to call the service and then route back out to the POTS. Many of these also allowed incoming calls from conventional phone equipment, providing local or [[toll-free number]]s for the inbound calls. This allowed users to place calls to and from anywhere with local access for a greatly reduced cost by avoiding the telephone company's own long-distance service.{{sfn|SIP}}\n\nToday, a call may travel for most of its \"distance\" as a SIP-initiated VOIP call, only exiting to the SS7 POTS network at the final stages, if ever. As this sort of call became common, even the largest service providers, like [[AT&T]], began offering SIP/VOIP to their customers.

Robocallers changed their tactics again, first by using phone numbers that were similar to the user's to make it appear local,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/you-think-its-your-friend-calling-but-its-actually-this-growing-phone-scam.html |title=You think it\u2019s your friend calling, but it\u2019s actually this growing phone scam |first=Annie |last=Nova |website=CNBC}}</ref> and later by using well-known numbers, often government agencies, as part of scams.<ref name=\"Understand\" /> Using such tactics, robocalls become an increasing problem, rising another 18% year-over-year in 2019 with 26 billion calls between January and October,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/truecaller-spam-call-robocall-report-2019/ |title=Spam calls grew 18% in 2019 |first=Manish |last=Singh |website=TechChrunch |date=December 3, 2019}}</ref> with an estimated 5.7 billion robocalls in the US placed in October 2019 alone.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/19/suspicious-robocalls-pitching-health-insurance-surged-october-now-feds-are-scrambling-act/ |title=Suspicious robocalls pitching health insurance surged in October.

This does not directly prevent the ability for a robocaller to spoof a caller ID, but it does allow upstream points to decide whether or not to trust that ID.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nFor instance, a business system using a VOIP-based PBX might connect to the wider telephony network through a service provider like [[RingCentral]] or [[Vonage]]. When the SIP packet is received by these providers, they will add additional information to the header, indicating whether they are sure the call originates with a known customer and whether or not the caller ID they provided is one that is known to their system. In this example, the internal phone number may not be known by the provider, but they may agree that all numbers starting with 555-555 do indeed belong to that customer, and that the provided ID, 555-555-1234, is therefore valid. Likewise, a customer might use a separate toll-free number for return calls and thus have a legitimate reason to use a totally different caller ID number, perhaps 800-123-4567.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThere are three levels of verification, or \"attestation\",{{sfn|FAQ}} possible in the STIR protocol. The highest level, \"Full Attestation\", indicated in the STIR header with an \"A\", indicates that the provider recognizes the entire phone number as being registered with the originating subscriber. This would be the case for a landline or mobile phone where the customer connects directly to the VOIP network and the phone number can be verified as being a particular customer, or in the case of a company that has registered a particular callback number. \"Partial Attestation\", or \"B\", indicates that the call originated with a known customer but the entire number cannot be verified, which would be the case with a call originating from a client PBX where the extension number is not registered with the provider. \"Gateway Attestation\", \"C\", indicates the call can only be verified as coming from a known gateway, for instance, a connection to another service provider.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nSTIR systems produce a [[JSON Web Token]] containing, among other things, the originating phone number as provided by the original SIP, the number being called, and the level of attestation being given by the provider. This information is then encrypted with the provider's private key, encoded using [[Base64]], and appended to the original SIP header in a new Identity field. The new information now travels along with the original SIP request until it reaches its destination, another VOIP system or provider that will route the call to an external telephone.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nOn reception, the STIR information is decoded using the provider's public key. If this fails, the STIR information can be considered invalid. If it properly decodes, it can extract the information and examine the attestation to decide whether to allow the call to continue. In the case of a VOIP endpoint on a [[smart phone]], for instance, the display might show that the call is of an unknown origin (\"C\") or that it failed verification entirely.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nAnyone on the VOIP side of the call can add a STIR header claiming \"A\" attestation even to known-bad calls. This may start in a robocaller's software, for instance. In this case, upstream users would not have the keys necessary to decode the STIR header and the authentication would fail. The software might also encode a header spoofing the organization to claim it is a trusted source, say RingCentral, but in this case, the known public key for RingCentral would fail to decode the header and the authentication would fail.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe STIR system relies on a [[chain of trust]]. For this to work, the system requires certification services that are well known so end user software knows whom to query to retrieve the public key, and are trusted to provide valid information and not provide keys to known-bad players. This network will be based on the existing [[Certificate Authority]] system in use today.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe robocaller might find a VOIP provider willing to sign their calls even though they are known-bad, in the same fashion that there are [[internet service provider]]s that provide service to known [[email spam]] farms {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. To combat this, the STIR header contains both the original phone number when it enters the provider as well as the caller ID being claimed. If these do not match, the STIR authentication fails. For such a certificate to get through, the provider would also have to be willing to fake the number on reception, for instance, by copying whatever caller ID number the robocaller provided. In this case the STIR will validate correctly, and stopping such calls will have to be done at a higher level, through [[Certificate revocation list|key revocation]] or similar.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe STIR system is defined<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ietf.org/blog/stir-action/ |title=STIR into Action |website=IETF}}</ref> as a series of [[Request for Comments]] documents by the IETF:\n\n* RFC 8224 - Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n* RFC 8225 - PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token\n* RFC 8226 - Secure Telephone Identity Credentials: Certificates\n* RFC 8588 - Personal Assertion Token (PaSSporT) Extension for Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN)\n\n==SHAKEN==\nSTIR is based on SIP and is designed to work with calls being routed through a VOIP network. It does not work within the \"original\" telephony network, which relies on standards such as SS7 to route calls.<ref name=47CFR /> VOIP calls enter the network at the \"edge\" through a variety of VOIP-to-telephony gateways, and they can receive STIR information at that point or anywhere earlier during the VOIP section of the call. But once inside the telephony network there is no standard for forwarding that STIR information to the end user.{{sfn|FAQ}}\n\nAdditionally, STIR does not define how authentication failures should be handled within the network. In a system where most calls will not have STIR information, at least during the period where the system is being set up, failed STIR checks cannot simply block the call.{{sfn|FAQ}} Some sort of information has to be sent to the user, but the precise nature of that information is not part of STIR itself.\n\nTo address these last-mile problems, the [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) began work on an associated system known as SHAKEN. SHAKEN includes systems to pass STIR information through the SS7 network, a standard for the data to be added to SIP for calls originating in the SS7 network, how to send STIR information to POTS endpoints, and a set of guidelines on how to handle various STIR failures.{{sfn|FAQ}}\n\nIn the common case of a robocaller calling an end user on a landline or mobile phone, it is the last step of the connection that does not directly handle STIR. For instance, if a call originates in a VOIP system and was tagged with a STIR header that successfully authenticated, the caller ID provided to the user might be appended with \"(verified)\", whereas one that fails might say \"(spoofed)\" or \"(no verification)\".{{sfn|Cert}}\n\n{{asof|2019}}, the exact nature of the messages sent to end users is still being discussed.{{sfn|FAQ}}{{update inline|date=February 2020}} The Secure Telephone Identity Governance Authority, or STI-GA, is organizing these discussions as well as calling for certificate authorities who will handle the majority of the key protocol.<ref>{{cite web |website=STI-GA |title=STI-GA Call for Certificate Authorities |url=https://sites.atis.org/insights/sti-ga-call-for-certificate-authorities/ |first=Marcella |last=Wolfe |date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, the Secure Telephone Identity Policy Administrator, or STI-PA, has the job of actually carrying out policy decisions like key revocation.

This had the advantage of making it impossible for the called user to call back to complain, or even report the call to their provider or government agency like the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Users quickly learned to stop taking calls from obviously faked IDs.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nIn response, robocallers began using less obviously incorrect IDs, but these had a lower chance of being picked up - the chance to ignore a call from an unknown user was precisely why many used caller ID in the first place. Robocallers changed their tactics again, first by using phone numbers that were similar to the user's to make it appear local,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/you-think-its-your-friend-calling-but-its-actually-this-growing-phone-scam.html |title=You think it\u2019s your friend calling, but it\u2019s actually this growing phone scam |first=Annie |last=Nova |website=CNBC}}</ref> and later by using well-known numbers, often government agencies, as part of scams.<ref name=\"Understand\" /> Using such tactics, robocalls become an increasing problem, rising another 18% year-over-year in 2019 with 26 billion calls between January and October,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/truecaller-spam-call-robocall-report-2019/ |title=Spam calls grew 18% in 2019 |first=Manish |last=Singh |website=TechChrunch |date=December 3, 2019}}</ref> with an estimated 5.7 billion robocalls in the US placed in October 2019 alone.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/19/suspicious-robocalls-pitching-health-insurance-surged-october-now-feds-are-scrambling-act/ |title=Suspicious robocalls pitching health insurance surged in October.

This does not directly prevent the ability for a robocaller to spoof a caller ID, but it does allow upstream points to decide whether or not to trust that ID.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nFor instance, a business system using a VOIP-based PBX might connect to the wider telephony network through a service provider like [[RingCentral]] or [[Vonage]]. When the SIP packet is received by these providers, they will add additional information to the header, indicating whether they are sure the call originates with a known customer and whether or not the caller ID they provided is one that is known to their system. In this example, the internal phone number may not be known by the provider, but they may agree that all numbers starting with 555-555 do indeed belong to that customer, and that the provided ID, 555-555-1234, is therefore valid. Likewise, a customer might use a separate toll-free number for return calls and thus have a legitimate reason to use a totally different caller ID number, perhaps 800-123-4567.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThere are three levels of verification, or \"attestation\",{{sfn|FAQ}} possible in the STIR protocol. The highest level, \"Full Attestation\", indicated in the STIR header with an \"A\", indicates that the provider recognizes the entire phone number as being registered with the originating subscriber. This would be the case for a landline or mobile phone where the customer connects directly to the VOIP network and the phone number can be verified as being a particular customer, or in the case of a company that has registered a particular callback number. \"Partial Attestation\", or \"B\", indicates that the call originated with a known customer but the entire number cannot be verified, which would be the case with a call originating from a client PBX where the extension number is not registered with the provider. \"Gateway Attestation\", \"C\", indicates the call can only be verified as coming from a known gateway, for instance, a connection to another service provider.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nSTIR systems produce a [[JSON Web Token]] containing, among other things, the originating phone number as provided by the original SIP, the number being called, and the level of attestation being given by the provider. This information is then encrypted with the provider's private key, encoded using [[Base64]], and appended to the original SIP header in a new Identity field. The new information now travels along with the original SIP request until it reaches its destination, another VOIP system or provider that will route the call to an external telephone.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nOn reception, the STIR information is decoded using the provider's [[public key]]. If this fails, the STIR information can be considered invalid. If it properly decodes, it can extract the information and examine the attestation to decide whether to allow the call to continue. In the case of a VOIP endpoint on a [[smart phone]], for instance, the display might show that the call is of an unknown origin (\"C\") or that it failed verification entirely.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nAnyone on the VOIP side of the call can add a STIR header claiming \"A\" attestation even to known-bad calls. This may start in a robocaller's software, for instance. In this case, upstream users would not have the keys necessary to decode the STIR header and the authentication would fail. The software might also encode a header spoofing the organization to claim it is a trusted source, say RingCentral, but in this case, the known public key for RingCentral would fail to decode the header and the authentication would fail.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe STIR system relies on a [[chain of trust]]. For this to work, the system requires certification services that are well known so end user software knows whom to query to retrieve the public key, and are trusted to provide valid information and not provide keys to known-bad players. This network will be based on the existing [[Certificate Authority]] system in use today.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe robocaller might find a VOIP provider willing to sign their calls even though they are known-bad, in the same fashion that there are [[internet service provider]]s that provide service to known [[email spam]] farms {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}. To combat this, the STIR header contains both the original phone number when it enters the provider as well as the caller ID being claimed. If these do not match, the STIR authentication fails. For such a certificate to get through, the provider would also have to be willing to fake the number on reception, for instance, by copying whatever caller ID number the robocaller provided. In this case the STIR will validate correctly, and stopping such calls will have to be done at a higher level, through [[Certificate revocation list|key revocation]] or similar.<ref name=\"Understand\" />\n\nThe STIR system is defined<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ietf.org/blog/stir-action/ |title=STIR into Action |website=IETF}}</ref> as a series of [[Request for Comments]] documents by the IETF:\n\n* RFC 8224 - Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n* RFC 8225 - PASSporT: Personal Assertion Token\n* RFC 8226 - Secure Telephone Identity Credentials: Certificates\n* RFC 8588 - Personal Assertion Token (PaSSporT) Extension for Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN)\n\n==SHAKEN==\nSTIR is based on SIP and is designed to work with calls being routed through a VOIP network. It does not work within the \"original\" telephony network, which relies on standards such as SS7 to route calls.<ref name=47CFR /> VOIP calls enter the network at the \"edge\" through a variety of VOIP-to-telephony gateways, and they can receive STIR information at that point or anywhere earlier during the VOIP section of the call. But once inside the telephony network there is no standard for forwarding that STIR information to the end user.{{sfn|FAQ}}\n\nAdditionally, STIR does not define how authentication failures should be handled within the network. In a system where most calls will not have STIR information, at least during the period where the system is being set up, failed STIR checks cannot simply block the call.{{sfn|FAQ}} Some sort of information has to be sent to the user, but the precise nature of that information is not part of STIR itself.\n\nTo address these last-mile problems, the [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) began work on an associated system known as SHAKEN. SHAKEN includes systems to pass STIR information through the SS7 network, a standard for the data to be added to SIP for calls originating in the SS7 network, how to send STIR information to POTS endpoints, and a set of guidelines on how to handle various STIR failures.{{sfn|FAQ}}\n\nIn the common case of a robocaller calling an end user on a landline or mobile phone, it is the last step of the connection that does not directly handle STIR. For instance, if a call originates in a VOIP system and was tagged with a STIR header that successfully authenticated, the caller ID provided to the user might be appended with \"(verified)\", whereas one that fails might say \"(spoofed)\" or \"(no verification)\".{{sfn|Cert}}\n\n{{asof|2019}}, the exact nature of the messages sent to end users is still being discussed.{{sfn|FAQ}}{{update inline|date=February 2020}} The Secure Telephone Identity Governance Authority, or STI-GA, is organizing these discussions as well as calling for certificate authorities who will handle the majority of the key protocol.<ref>{{cite web |website=STI-GA |title=STI-GA Call for Certificate Authorities |url=https://sites.atis.org/insights/sti-ga-call-for-certificate-authorities/ |first=Marcella |last=Wolfe |date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, the Secure Telephone Identity Policy Administrator, or STI-PA, has the job of actually carrying out policy decisions like key revocation.
