The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode\u2014known as Spirits Mode\u2014will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI.  Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode.  For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed).\n\nThe basic [[batting (baseball)|batting]] interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel.  Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes.  The [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.\n\n==== Reception ====\nAround the time of its release, it was the only PlayStation 3 video game that was among the top 50 best-selling video games in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Lai |title=PS3 sales decrease 18 percent; No. 5 in Japan |url=http://news.punchjump.com/article.php?id=4073 |work=Punch Jump |date=2007-04-20 |access-date=2008-06-21 |quote=... the PS3 sold 11,948 units between Apr. 9 and Apr. 15. ...

The graphics were enhanced further from the previous incarnation, but the major fixes were in the gameplay.  First of all, the load times that plagued the previous game were fixed, meaning less of the \"black screens\" that ere used for short load times in PYS4.  The game also has more of a television-style presentation, new animations for slap hits, and a new meter that tells players what pitch the CPU batter is expecting.\n\nThe new mode in PYS5 which replaces the MVP Mode in the previous game is Stardom Mode.  It plays like a full-fledged Career Mode, where a player can either take control of an existing player or create their own player to go through a maximum of 20 years of play.  Experience points are distributed on how well the player does in his at-bat.\n\n==== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 5 Kanzenban'' ====\nOn December 4, 2008, Konami released a new, updated version of Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 5, with the subtitle \"''Kanzenban'',\" which means \"Perfect Version.\"  Priced at 8000 yen (US$88) and released on both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]], Kanzenban touted many improvements over the original as a post-season version of the game.  For instance, every player who appeared in a game in the 2008 NPB season for all 12 teams was included on each team's roster, there were new player animations, enhanced artificial intelligence, and also small improvements to graphics (foreign players, for example, no longer look generic and have their actual swings), online play, baserunning, and fielding.\n\n''Kanzenban'' marked the first time since ''Pro Yakyu Spirits 2004 Climax'' that a PYS game had been re-made for a post-season version, similar to that of the ''\"Ketteiban\"'' games in Pro Yakyu Spirits' sister series, [[Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu]].\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6\n| image          = \n| caption        = Cover art\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|July 16, 2009}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]]\n}}\n\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 6''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c46, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6'') is a [[baseball]] simulation [[video game]] developed by [[Konami]] and PawaPuro Productions for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]] that was released on July 16, 2009.<ref name=\"Gamespot2\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/sports/proyakyuuspirits6/index.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=Pro_Yakyuu_Spirits_6 game page |accessdate=2009-12-02 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\n==== New Features ====\nThe new major mode in the game for this season is the [[World Baseball Classic]] Mode.  Upon booting the game, the first menu is to decide whether the player wants to play the WBC mode or the regular Pro Yakyuu Spirits game.  The rosters are accurate for all WBC teams, and it is possible to play an entire tournament as any of the 16 teams.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2010'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2010\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|April 1, 2010}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]]\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 2010''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42010, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2010'') is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable that was released on April 1, 2010.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2011'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2011\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|April 14, 2011}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo 3DS]]\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 2011''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42010, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2011'') is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo 3DS that was released on April 14, 2011.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2012'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|March 29, 2012}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]]\n}}\n\n'''''Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012'''''(\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42012, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2012'') is a [[baseball]] simulation [[video game]] developed by [[Konami Digital Entertainment]] and PawaPuro Productions for the [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 3]] that was released on March 29, 2012.\n\n==== Resume ====\nThe previous version was released on the 3DS, but publishers have decided to give preference to PlayStation Vita.\n\nThe announced release date, is the same for all announced platforms, and is timed to the launch of a new baseball season.\n\n==== New features and updates ====\n* Has been completely redesigned graphics, back view of many of those before the operation.

The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode\u2014known as Spirits Mode\u2014will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI.  Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode.  For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed).\n\nThe basic [[batting (baseball)|batting]] interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel.  Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes.  The [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.\n\n==== Reception ====\nAround the time of its release, it was the only PlayStation 3 video game that was among the top 50 best-selling video games in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Lai |title=PS3 sales decrease 18 percent; No. 5 in Japan |url=http://news.punchjump.com/article.php?id=4073 |work=Punch Jump |date=2007-04-20 |access-date=2008-06-21 |quote=... the PS3 sold 11,948 units between Apr. 9 and Apr. 15. ...

The graphics were enhanced further from the previous incarnation, but the major fixes were in the gameplay.  First of all, the load times that plagued the previous game were fixed, meaning less of the \"black screens\" that ere used for short load times in PYS4.  The game also has more of a television-style presentation, new animations for slap hits, and a new meter that tells players what pitch the CPU batter is expecting.\n\nThe new mode in PYS5 which replaces the MVP Mode in the previous game is Stardom Mode.  It plays like a full-fledged Career Mode, where a player can either take control of an existing player or create their own player to go through a maximum of 20 years of play.  Experience points are distributed on how well the player does in his at-bat.\n\n==== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 5 Kanzenban'' ====\nOn December 4, 2008, Konami released a new, updated version of Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 5, with the subtitle \"''Kanzenban'',\" which means \"Perfect Version.\"  Priced at 8000 yen ($88 USD) and released on both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]], Kanzenban touted many improvements over the original as a post-season version of the game.  For instance, every player who appeared in a game in the 2008 NPB season for all 12 teams was included on each team's roster, there were new player animations, enhanced artificial intelligence, and also small improvements to graphics (foreign players, for example, no longer look generic and have their actual swings), online play, baserunning, and fielding.\n\n''Kanzenban'' marked the first time since ''Pro Yakyu Spirits 2004 Climax'' that a PYS game had been re-made for a post-season version, similar to that of the ''\"Ketteiban\"'' games in Pro Yakyu Spirits' sister series, [[Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu]].\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6\n| image          = \n| caption        = Cover art\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|July 16, 2009}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]]\n}}\n\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 6''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c46, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 6'') is a [[baseball]] simulation [[video game]] developed by [[Konami]] and PawaPuro Productions for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3]] that was released on July 16, 2009.<ref name=\"Gamespot2\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/sports/proyakyuuspirits6/index.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=Pro_Yakyuu_Spirits_6 game page |accessdate=2009-12-02 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\n==== New Features ====\nThe new major mode in the game for this season is the [[World Baseball Classic]] Mode.  Upon booting the game, the first menu is to decide whether the player wants to play the WBC mode or the regular Pro Yakyuu Spirits game.  The rosters are accurate for all WBC teams, and it is possible to play an entire tournament as any of the 16 teams.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2010'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2010\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|April 1, 2010}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]]\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 2010''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42010, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2010'') is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable that was released on April 1, 2010.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2011'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2011\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|April 14, 2011}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo 3DS]]\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n'''''Professional Yakyuu Spirits 2011''''' (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42010, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2011'') is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo 3DS that was released on April 14, 2011.\n\n=== ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2012'' ===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| released       = {{vgrelease|JP|March 29, 2012}}\n| genre          = [[Sports video game|Sports]],  [[Simulation video game|simulation]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]]\n}}\n\n'''''Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012'''''(\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c42012, ''Pro Yaky\u016b Spirits 2012'') is a [[baseball]] simulation [[video game]] developed by [[Konami Digital Entertainment]] and PawaPuro Productions for the [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 3]] that was released on March 29, 2012.\n\n==== Resume ====\nThe previous version was released on the 3DS, but publishers have decided to give preference to PlayStation Vita.\n\nThe announced release date, is the same for all announced platforms, and is timed to the launch of a new baseball season.\n\n==== New features and updates ====\n* Has been completely redesigned graphics, back view of many of those before the operation.

{"title_page": "Modern gold dinar", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe modern '''Islamic gold dinar''' (sometimes referred as '''Islamic dinar''' or '''Gold dinar''') is a projected [[bullion]] [[gold coin]], so far not issued as official [[currency]] by any national state.  It aims to revive the historical [[gold dinar]] which was a leading coin of early Islam. The currency might consist of minted [[gold coin]]s ([[dinar]]s) or of [[silver coin]]s ([[dirham]]s).\n\n==Dinar history==\n{{Main|Gold Dinar}}\n[[File:Dinar of Abd al-Malik, AH 75.jpg|thumb|[[Gold dinar]] of [[Abd al-Malik]], AH 75, [[Umayyad Caliphate]].]]\n\nAccording to Islamic law, the Islamic dinar is a coin of pure [[gold]] weighing 72 grains of average [[barley]]. Modern determinations of weight for the \"full solidus\" weigh 4.44 grams at the time of Heraclius and a \"light solidus\" equivalent to the weight of the [[mithqal]] weighing 4.25 grams. With the silver Dirham being created to the weight ratio of 7:10, yielded coins of 2.975 grams of pure silver.\n\n[[Umar|Umar Ibn al-Khattab]] established the known standard relationship between them based on their weights: 7 dinars must be equivalent (in weight) to 10 dirhams.\n\n{{cquote|The Revelation undertook to mention them and attached many judgements to them, for example ''[[zakat]]'', marriage, and ''[[hudud]]'', etc., therefore within the Revelation they have to have a reality and specific measure for assessment of zakat, etc. upon which its judgements may be based rather than on the non-shari'i other coins.<br /> <br />Know that there is [[Ijma|consensus]] since the beginning of Islam and the age of the Companions and the Followers that the dirham of the shari'ah is that of which ten weigh seven [[Mithqal]]s weight of the dinar of gold... The weight of a [[Mithqal]] of gold is seventy-two grains of barley, so that the dirham which is seven-tenths of it is fifty and two-fifths grains. All these measurements are firmly established by consensus. |[[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Muqaddimah|Al-Muqaddimah]]<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt. 34]</ref>}}\n\n==Value and denomination==\nPer the historical law stated above, one dinar is 4.25&nbsp;grams of pure gold, and a smaller denomination, the daniq, one sixth of that.

It aims to revive the historical [[gold dinar]] which was a leading coin of early Islam.

Modern determinations of weight for the \"full solidus\" weigh 4.44 grams at the time of Heraclius and a \"light solidus\" equivalent to the weight of the [[mithqal]] weighing 4.25 grams. With the silver Dirham being created to the weight ratio of 7:10, yielded coins of 2.975 grams of pure silver.\n\n[[Umar|Umar Ibn al-Khattab]] established the known standard relationship between them based on their weights: 7 dinars must be equivalent (in weight) to 10 dirhams.\n\n{{cquote|The Revelation undertook to mention them and attached many judgements to them, for example ''[[zakat]]'', marriage, and ''[[hudud]]'', etc., therefore within the Revelation they have to have a reality and specific measure for assessment of zakat, etc. upon which its judgements may be based rather than on the non-shari'i other coins.<br /> <br />Know that there is [[Ijma|consensus]] since the beginning of Islam and the age of the Companions and the Followers that the dirham of the shari'ah is that of which ten weigh seven [[Mithqal]]s weight of the dinar of gold... The weight of a [[Mithqal]] of gold is seventy-two grains of barley, so that the dirham which is seven-tenths of it is fifty and two-fifths grains. All these measurements are firmly established by consensus. |[[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Muqaddimah|Al-Muqaddimah]]<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt. 34]</ref>}}\n\n==Value and denomination==\nPer the historical law stated above, one dinar is 4.25&nbsp;grams of pure gold, and a smaller denomination, the daniq, one sixth of that.

In Peru she presented an installation that included a phone from which the audience could hear her long distance recorded conversations with her mother.\n\nThe same year she participated as a feature artist at PerformIt in [[Tucson]] [[Arizona]], organized by the Plugged Art Collective. Her participation included the performances The Teasing Monkey, Gallery Security, What Would It Take to leave Every Thing Behind, Acts of Love, Grooming Me, and Always Up.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}} Also in 2007 Elena was awarded the Grand Prix for her performances at the Parnu Performance Festival, in [[Estonia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this award}}\n\nIn 2008 Tejada-Herrera presented the exhibition \"About You\" at Dean Project Gallery in Long Island City [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this exhibition}} This exhibition started with street performances for which Tejada-Herrera invited passers by to participate. The performances included conversations, video portraits, and ephemeral performances made with the body among others. The passers by and witnesses were invited to the gallery to write their experiences and about their days. The exhibition opened with a video projection of the performance of the day and the first writings by the public on the gallery walls. Little by little, the walls were filled with texts. On a Sunday, Tejada-Herrera invited the public outside the gallery to enter and to paint on the walls. This was their day, in which the passers by painted and exhibited their creations within Tejada-Herrera's exhibition. At the closing reception, more video documentation of the performances made by Tejada-Herrera with the public and photographs were added. These were displayed in between the texts and paintings made by the public.\n\nIn 2009 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Lima]], [[Peru]] where she was invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}} Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden library furniture. There were huge amounts of shredded paper coming out of the furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music, and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.\n\nBack in the United States, Tejada-Herrera presented several art installations made in collaboration with office workers that facilitated the shredded paper that they collected for 15 days. These installations were presented at Miami International University.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this exhibition}} One of these pieces consisted of giant plastic bags filled with huge amounts of shredded paper. The other installation was a shelf from which colorful shredded paper fell like a waterfall on the floor. The installation ended with a participative performance with the workers.\n\nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera participated in a residency at [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}} Within this, Tejada-Herrera created several photo and video series. \n\nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Huancayo]] in Peru where she co-led a workshop along with the architect Alberto Tejada Herrera. The workshop was part of the CONEA, (Congreso Nacional de Estudiantes de Arquitectura) (National Peruvian Congress of Architectural Students){{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}}. in this workshop the students created architectural installations on public parks in the area. These were a playground and a bus stop.\n\nThe following years Tejada-Herrera realized several video art works with the subject of the male body and sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her works included a homage to the artist Giuseppe Campuzano.\n\nSince 2011 Tejada-Herrera returned to some object based art making, creating room sized installations and [[conceptual art|conceptual]] [[landscape]] interventions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including [[Chicago]] and [[Prague]].\n\nIn 2015 Tejada-Herrera presented an exhibition as part of 2nd Floor Rear, in which she invited the public to create [[costumes]], [[sculptures]], and [[art installations]] using the lines that she previously made with objects for the room sized installation Lengths of Consumption. The piece called \"Playtime is About You\" started with video projections of [[Zumba]] tutorials. After warming up the public was invited to play and create the collective installation.\n\nAlso in 2015 Elena Tejada-Herrera participated at the Chicago Home Theater Festival. The hosts for her site specific project were the artist [[Faheem Majeed]] and his wife [[LaShana Jackson]].  \nJust as in former projects, Tejada-Herrera invited her hosts to participate within the artwork. The video piece was presented on the 16th of May at Majeed's and Jackson's home along with the artworks of other local artists from Chicago.\n\nTejada-Herrera has a continuous presence within the art scene in Chicago, other cities in the United States, and internationally.

The performances included conversations, video portraits, and ephemeral performances made with the body among others. The passers by and witnesses were invited to the gallery to write their experiences and about their days. The exhibition opened with a video projection of the performance of the day and the first writings by the public on the gallery walls. Little by little, the walls were filled with texts. On a Sunday, Tejada-Herrera invited the public outside the gallery to enter and to paint on the walls. This was their day, in which the passers by painted and exhibited their creations within Tejada-Herrera's exhibition. At the closing reception, more video documentation of the performances made by Tejada-Herrera with the public and photographs were added. These were displayed in between the texts and paintings made by the public.\n\nIn 2009 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Lima]], [[Peru]] where she was invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}} Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden library furniture. There were huge amounts of shredded paper coming out of the furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music, and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.\n\nBack in the United States, Tejada-Herrera presented several art installations made in collaboration with office workers that facilitated the shredded paper that they collected for 15 days. These installations were presented at Miami International University.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this exhibition}} One of these pieces consisted of giant plastic bags filled with huge amounts of shredded paper. The other installation was a shelf from which colorful shredded paper fell like a waterfall on the floor. The installation ended with a participative performance with the workers.\n\nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera participated in a residency at [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}} Within this, Tejada-Herrera created several photo and video series. \n\nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Huancayo]] in Peru where she co-led a workshop along with the architect Alberto Tejada Herrera. The workshop was part of the CONEA, (Congreso Nacional de Estudiantes de Arquitectura) (National Peruvian Congress of Architectural Students){{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=A RS is needed to back up this statement}}. in this workshop the students created architectural installations on public parks in the area. These were a playground and a bus stop.\n\nThe following years Tejada-Herrera realized several video art works with the subject of the male body and sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her works included a homage to the artist Giuseppe Campuzano.\n\nSince 2011 Tejada-Herrera returned to some object based art making, creating room sized installations and [[conceptual art|conceptual]] [[landscape]] interventions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including [[Chicago]] and [[Prague]].\n\nIn 2015 Tejada-Herrera presented an exhibition as part of 2nd Floor Rear, in which she invited the public to create [[costumes]], [[sculptures]], and [[art installations]] using the lines that she previously made with objects for the room sized installation Lengths of Consumption. The piece called \"Playtime is About You\" started with video projections of [[Zumba]] tutorials. After warming up the public was invited to play and create the collective installation.\n\nAlso in 2015 Elena Tejada-Herrera participated at the Chicago Home Theater Festival. The hosts for her site specific project were the artist [[Faheem Majeed]] and his wife [[LaShana Jackson]].  \nJust as in former projects, Tejada-Herrera invited her hosts to participate within the artwork. The video piece was presented on the 16th of May at Majeed's and Jackson's home along with the artworks of other local artists from Chicago.\n\nTejada-Herrera has a continuous presence within the art scene in Chicago, other cities in the United States, and internationally.

In 1986, rappers like [[Schoolly D]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]] had the first, somewhat developed, styles of the hi-top fade in [[hip hop]]. However, their hairstyles lacked the geometric precision that characterized the more modern hi-top fade styles.\n\nIn the hip-hop community, one of the first public appearances of the more modern hi-top fade hairstyles was in the \"Tramp\" video by [[Salt-N-Pepa]], released early in 1987. In this video, the dancers could be seen with this hairstyle. They can be also seen dancing in a [[new jack swing]] style form based on their wardrobe and choreography, which was not seen in other hip hop and R&B videos at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allthingshair.com/en-us/mens-hairstyles/black-mens-hairstyles/juice-haircut-ideas/|title=Juice Haircut and High-Top Fades: 5 Looks We Love|date=2019-03-22|website=All Things Hair United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid- to late 1980s the haircut was often credited to [[Larry Blackmon]] the lead singer of the band [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]]. Blackmon had a hairstyle in the mid 1980s that was the forerunner to the hi-top Fade, with the tall square flat top but with slightly longer sides and back. There are numerous examples of rappers referring to the hairstyle as a \"cameo cut\" between 1987 and 1990, the most notable being in the [[Ultramagnetic MCs]] song \"Give The Drummer Some\" from 1988 where [[Ced Gee]], who had a hi-top fade at the time, says \"... 'cause I'm a real pro, with a cameo, and not an afro\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mldb.org/song-140355-give-the-drummer-some.html|title=MLDb, The Music Lyrics Database - Lyrics of Ultramagnetic MC's - Give the Drummer Some|website=www.mldb.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Growth in popularity==\nBy 1986, many young African American people, especially in the New York City, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia areas, began to follow the hi-top fade trend. At this time, hi-top fades became more geometrically defined, becoming more massive and 'higher' along with differences in shape as well as more designs. More music videos released from the fall of 1987 to the spring of 1988, such as \"I Don't Care\" by [[Audio Two]] (1988),\"2 Hype\" by [[Kid 'N Play]] (1988), \"Move the Crowd\" by [[Eric B. & Rakim]] (1987) (a few extras could be seen wearing one), \"Paper Thin\" by [[MC Lyte]] (1988), \"Rising to the Top\" by [[Doug E. Fresh]] (1988), \"Do This My Way\" by [[Kid 'N Play]] (1988), and \"Ain't No Half Steppin'\" by [[Big Daddy Kane]] (1988), shows examples of early trends of the more developed hi-top fade. In EPMD's \"You Gots To Chill\" several dancers and the DJ can be seen sporting Hi top fades in the music video.\n\nDifferent substyles emerged around the same time such as the \"gumby\" (slanted hi-top that had a shape similar to the [[Gumby]] cartoon character) or ''reagan'' (similar to the gumby but with more 'parts' and designs). Many of the teenage castmembers on the films ''[[Lean on Me (film)|Lean On Me]]'' (1989) with [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Do The Right Thing]]'' (1989) could be seen wearing these Gumby-shaped hairstyles. Recording artists such as [[Bobby Brown]], [[TKA]] and [[Coro (singer)|Coro]] also wore the hi-top fade.\n\nFrom late 1988 to 1989, the hi-top fade was the symbol of the rap culture at the time. Rappers such as [[Kid 'N Play]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Kwam\u00e9 (rapper)|Kwam\u00e9]] were internationally famous for helping promote this trend worldwide, particularly Kid 'N Play member [[Christopher Reid (entertainer)|Christopher \"Kid\" Reid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TQPXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA238&dq=Hi-top+fade&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIgpba2_PNAhWLKMAKHYS1BcQQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=Hi-top%20fade&f=false |title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and ... |page=238 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> In late 1988, hi-top fades even became more developed, more hip-hoppers and people outside the New York area began following this trend. This hairstyle also helped define the new jack swing movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The video \"Fight the Power\" by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], which was shot in April 1989, shows how much the trend set across the world and was highly symbolic of urban style at the time. Rapper and actor [[Will Smith]] sported a hi-top fade during the production of the popular [[sitcom]] ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', even referencing the hairstyle in a first season episode of the show.\n\n==Changing trends==\nThe conventional hi-top began to fall out of fashion in the early 1990s and was changed by revolutionary RnB groups like [[Jodeci]], who added slits and unique designs that are still imitated till this day. This style became the staple design set by the group who were the self-imposed \"bad boys of RnB\". The turning point was between 1995 and 1997 many people who had sported the hi-top fade started to move toward other men's styles.\n\nStill, the hi-top remained common among many groups of young adults and teenagers for a few years longer. As for the braided style of hi-top fades, it characterized an era of [[Afrocentrism|'afrocentricity']] of hip hop and embracing the rap culture. [[Golden age hip hop|Golden age]] MCs like [[Def Jef]] and the hip hop group [[De La Soul]] are known for their braided hi-top fade styles in 1989 and 1990. Many back-up dancers in many hip hop, dance, and R&B videos could be seen wearing similar hairstyles from 1990 to 1992. This trend continued until 1994 when urban hair style simplified into low-cut fade hair cuts and [[cornrows|cornrow]] hairstyles. This hairstyle was also a fashion trend of new jack swing era.\n\n==Modern hi-top fades==\n[[File:Nerlens-Noel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nerlens Noel]], a basketball player in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)]]\n\nThe style began to slowly reemerge in popularity in the early to late 2000s, as a new generation of black musicians, athletes, and actors began to embrace this hairstyle.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thegazette.news/?p=8791 |title=Hair Trend: The High Top fade makes a comeback &#124; Botswana Gazette |website=Thegazette.news |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> A prominent example is former [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] guard/forward [[Iman Shumpert]].
