His father, [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700. However, since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip's older brother, [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne, the Grand Dauphin's maternal uncle (Philip's granduncle) King [[Charles II of Spain]] named Philip as his heir in his will. It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe, such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it. Indeed, Philip's accession in Spain provoked the 13-year [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which continued until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain.\n\nPhilip was the first member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to rule as King of Spain. The sum of his two reigns, 45 years and 21 days, is the longest in modern Spanish history.\n\n==Early years==\nPhilip was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]]<ref>''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'', p. 14. Published by Dodd, Mead and Company, 1903.</ref> in France as the second son of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], the heir apparent to the throne of France, and his wife [[Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria]],<ref name=kamen>Kamen, Henry. \"Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice\", Published by Yale University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-300-08718-7}}</ref> known as the ''Dauphine Victoire''. He was a younger brother of [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], the father of [[Louis XV of France]]. At birth, Philip was created [[List of Angevin monarchs|Duke of Anjou]], a traditional title for younger sons in the French royal family. He would be known by this name until he became the King of Spain. Since Philip's older brother, the Duke of Burgundy, was second in line to the French throne after his father, there was little expectation that either he or his younger brother [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686-1714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]], would ever rule over France.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nPhilip lived his first years under the supervision of the royal governess [[Louise de Prie]] and after that was tutored with his brothers by [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon]], Archbishop of [[Cambrai]]. The three were also educated by [[Paul de Beauvilliers, 2nd duc de Saint-Aignan|Paul de Beauvilliers]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Claims to the Spanish throne===\n[[File:Philippe de France proclam\u00e9 roi d'Espagne.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Proclamation of Philip V as King of Spain in the Palace of Versailles on 16 November 1700]]\n\nIn 1700, King [[Charles II of Spain]] died childless. His will named as successor Philip, grandson of Charles' half-sister [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the first wife of Louis XIV.<ref name=kamen/> Upon any possible refusal, the crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother, the Duke of Berry, then to the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]], later Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.<ref name=kamen/> Philip had the better genealogical claim to the Spanish throne, because his Spanish [[Maria Theresa of Spain|grandmother]] and [[Anne of Austria|great-grandmother]] were older than the ancestors of the Archduke Charles of Austria. However, the Austrians maintained that Philip's grandmother had renounced the Spanish throne for herself and her descendants as part of her marriage contract. The French claimed that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.<ref>Durant, Will. \"The Age of Louis XIV\", p. 699. Simon and Schuster, New York, 1963.</ref>\n\nAfter a long Royal Council meeting in France at which the Dauphin spoke up in favour of his son's rights, it was agreed that Philip would ascend the throne, but he would forever renounce his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants.<ref name=kamen/> The Royal Council decided to accept the provisions of the will of Charles II naming Philip, [[King of Spain]], and the Spanish ambassador was called in and introduced to his new king. The ambassador, along with his son, knelt before Philip and made a long speech in Spanish, which Philip did not understand. (Louis XIV, the son and husband of Spanish princesses, did speak Spanish, but Philip learned only later.){{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\n===First marriage===\nOn 2 November 1701, the almost 18-year-old Philip married the 13-year-old [[Maria Luisa of Savoy]], as chosen by his grandfather King Louis XIV. She was the daughter of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy]], and his wife [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]], Philip's first cousin once removed.  The Duke and Duchess of Savoy were also the parents of [[Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy]], Duchess of Burgundy, Philip's sister-in-law. There was a proxy ceremony at [[Turin]], the capital of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and another one at Versailles on 11 September.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\nMaria Luisa proved very popular as Queen of Spain. She served as regent for her husband on several occasions. Her most successful term was when Philip was away touring his Italian domains for nine months in 1702, when she was just 14 years old. On entering Naples that year he was presented with Bernini's ''[[Boy with a Dragon]]'' by [[Carlo Barberini]]. In 1714, Maria Luisa died at the age of 26 from [[tuberculosis]], a devastating emotional blow to her husband.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\n==War of the Spanish Succession==\n{{Main article|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Mel\u00e9ndez, Miguel Jacinto - Philip V, king of Spain, in suit of hunt - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip V of Spain in hunting attire]]\n[[File:Vendome-and-PhilipV.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip (right) at the [[Battle of Villaviciosa]]]]\n[[File:X\u00e0tiva.

In February 1701, Louis XIV caused the ''[[Parlement]]'' of Paris (a court) to register a decree that if Philip's elder brother, the [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|''Petit Dauphin'' Louis]], died without an heir, then Philip would surrender the throne of Spain for the succession to the throne of France, ensuring dynastic continuity in Europe's greatest land power.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, a second act of the French king \"justified a hostile interpretation\": pursuant to a treaty with Spain, Louis occupied several towns in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (modern Belgium and [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]]). This was the spark that ignited the powder keg created by the unresolved issues of the [[War of the League of Augsburg]] (1689\u201397) and the acceptance of the Spanish inheritance by Louis XIV for his grandson.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlmost immediately the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. Concern among other European powers that Spain and France united under a single Bourbon monarch would upset the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] pitted powerful France and weak Spain against the Grand Alliance of England, the Netherlands and Austria.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685\u20131715'' (1962)</ref>\n\nInside Spain, the [[Crown of Castile]] supported Philip of France. On the other hand, the majority of the nobility of the [[Crown of Aragon]] supported [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]], son of Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] and claimant to the Spanish throne by right of his grandmother [[Maria Anna of Spain]]. Charles was even hailed as King of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] under the name Charles III.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe war was centred in Spain and west-central Europe (especially the [[Low Countries]]), with other important fighting in Germany and Italy. [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] distinguished themselves as military commanders in the Low Countries. In colonial North America, the conflict became known to the English colonists who fought against French and Spanish forces as [[Queen Anne's War]]. Over the course of the fighting, some 400,000 people were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/wars18c.htm |title=Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Eighteenth Century|author= Matthew White |publisher=Users.erols.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this war as a backdrop that, beginning in 1707, Philip issued the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], which centralized Spanish rule under the Castilian political and administrative model and in the process abolished the charters of all independently administered kingdoms within Spain\u2014most notably the [[Crown of Aragon]], which was supporting Charles VI in the conflict\u2014except for the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and the rest of the Basque region, who had supported Philip in the war for the Spanish throne, and retained their [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|semi-autonomous self-government]]. The policy of centralization had as model the [[France|French State]] under [[Louis XIV]] and was strongly supported by politicians such as [[Joseph de Sol\u00eds]] and the [[Sardinia|Sardinian-born]] [[political philosopher]] [[Vicente Bacallar]].<ref>Enrico Bogliolo, ''Tradizione e innovazione nel pensiero politico di Vincenzo Bacallar'', Turin, 1987, ''passim'' (in Italian).</ref>\n\nAt one point in 1712 Philip was offered the choice of renouncing the throne of Spain so that he could be made heir of France, but he refused.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nPhilip decided to relinquish his right of succession to France under one condition: the introduction of [[semi-Salic law]] in Spain. Under this law, the succession to the Spanish crown was limited to his entire male line before it could pass to any female, a condition of his renunciation made clear to the allies during the preliminaries of the Treaties of Utrecht. It was not until this was successfully accomplished (10 May 1713) that Spain and Great Britain made their own peace terms at the second Treaty of Utrecht (annexing the new law to the Treaty). By the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] that concluded the war, Philip was recognized as king of Spain but Spain was forced to cede [[Menorca]] and [[Gibraltar]] to Great Britain; the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Naples]], [[Milan]], and [[Sardinia]] to the Austrian [[Habsburg]]s; and [[Sicily]] and parts of [[Milan]] to [[Savoy]].<ref>J. S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 6: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25'' (1970) ch 13\u201314</ref>\n\nThese losses greatly diminished the Spanish Empire in Europe, which had already been in decline. Throughout his reign, Philip sought to reverse the decline of Spanish power. Trying to overturn the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, he attempted to re-establish Spanish claims in Italy, triggering the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718\u20131720) in which Spain fought a coalition of four major powers. Phillip V was forced to sue for peace.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Second marriage===\nShortly after the death of Queen Maria Luisa in 1714, the King decided to marry again. His second wife was [[Elisabeth of Parma]], daughter of [[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma]], and [[Dorothea Sophie of the Palatinate]]. At the age of 22, on 24 December 1714, she was married to the 31-year-old Philip by proxy in [[Parma]]. The marriage was arranged by [[Giulio Alberoni|Cardinal Alberoni]], with the concurrence of the [[Marie Anne de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins|Princesse des Ursins]], the ''[[Camarera mayor de Palacio]]'' (\"chief of the household\") of the king of Spain.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Abdication===\n[[File:Breech loading firearm belonged to Philip V of Spain by A Tienza Madrid circa 1715.jpg|thumb|A breech loading [[miquelet]] musket with a reusable cartridge, used by Philip V, made by A. Tienza, Madrid, circa 1715]]\n\nOn 14 January 1724, Philip abdicated the throne to his eldest son, the seventeen-year-old [[Louis I of Spain|Louis]], for reasons still subject to debate. One theory suggests that Philip V, who exhibited many elements of mental instability during his reign, did not wish to reign due to his increasing mental decline.<ref>p358, E.N. Williams, The Penguin Dictionary of English and European History</ref> A second theory puts the abdication in context of the Bourbon dynasty. The French royal family recently had lost many legitimate agnates to diseases. Indeed, Philip V's abdication occurred just over a month after the death of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who had been regent for [[Louis XV]] of France. The lack of an heir made another continental war of succession a possibility. Philip V was a legitimate descendant of Louis XIV, but matters were complicated by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which forbade a union of the French and Spanish crowns. The theory supposes that Philip V hoped that by abdicating the Spanish crown he could circumvent the Treaty and succeed to the French throne.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn any case, Louis died on 31 August 1724 in [[Madrid]] of [[smallpox]], having reigned only seven months and leaving no issue. Philip was forced to return to the Spanish throne as his younger son, the later [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]], was not yet of age.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Later reign==\n[[File:FelipVTomba.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Philip V and Elizabeth Farnese in the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, in the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]] ([[Segovia]]).]]\n\nPhilip helped his Bourbon relatives to make territorial gains in the [[War of the Polish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] by reconquering Naples and Sicily from Austria and [[Oran]] from the [[Ottomans]]. Finally, at the end of his reign Spanish forces also successfully defended their American territories from a large British invasion during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u20131748).{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring Philip's reign, Spain began to recover from the stagnation it had suffered during the twilight of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] dynasty. Although the population of Spain grew, the financial and taxation systems were archaic and the treasury ran deficits. The king employed thousands of highly paid retainers at his palaces\u2014not to rule the country but to look after the royal family. The army and bureaucracy went months without pay and only the shipments of silver from the New World kept the system going. Spain suspended payments on its debt in 1739\u2014effectively declaring bankruptcy.<ref>John Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain 1700\u20131808'' (1989) pp 109\u2013113</ref>\n\n===Death===\nPhilip was afflicted by fits of manic depression and increasingly fell victim to a deep melancholia.<ref name=\"Joan\"/> His second wife, Elizabeth Farnese, completely dominated her passive husband.

Lynch says Philip V advanced the government only marginally over that of his predecessors and was more of a liability than the incapacitated Charles II. When a conflict came up between the interests of Spain and France, he usually favored France. However Philip did make some reforms in government, and strengthened the central authorities relative to the provinces. Merit became more important, although most senior positions still went to the landed aristocracy. Below the elite level, the inefficiency and corruption that had existed under Charles II was as widespread as ever. The reforms started by Philip V culminated in much more important reforms of Charles III.<ref>Lynch (1989) pp 67- 115</ref> The economy, on the whole, improved over the previous half-century, with greater productivity, and fewer famines and epidemics   The government promoted industry, agriculture and shipbuilding.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1871302|last1 = Hamilton|first1 = Earl J.|title = Money and Economic Recovery in Spain under the First Bourbon, 1701-1746|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 15|issue = 3|pages = 192\u2013206|year = 1943|doi = 10.1086/236742}}</ref> After the destruction of the main silver fleet at Vigo in 1702, the Navy was rebuilt.

During this Atlantic trade emerged important figures of the naval history of Spain, among which stands out the [[Pirate|corsair]] [[Amaro Pargo]]. Philip V frequently benefited the corsair in his commercial incursions and corsairs: he granted a Royal order given at the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]] in [[Madrid]] in September 1714, in which he appointed him captain of a commercial ship bound for [[Caracas]].<ref name=\"DocsAmaro\">{{Cite book| publisher = Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Santa Cruz de Tenerife| isbn = 978-84-7947-637-3| last1 = De Paz S\u00e1nchez| first1 = Manuel| last2 = Garc\u00eda Pulido| first2 = Daniel| others = Francisco Javier Mac\u00edas Mart\u00edn (ed.)| title = El corsario de Dios.

19 December 1683 \u2013 9 July 1746) was [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]] from 1 November 1700 to his [[abdication]] in favour of his son [[Louis I of Spain|Louis]] on 14 January 1724, and from his reaccession of the throne upon his son's death, 6 September 1724 to his own death on 9 July 1746.\n\nBefore his reign, Philip occupied an exalted place in the royal family of [[France]] as a grandson of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. His father, [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700. However, since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip's older brother, [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne, the Grand Dauphin's maternal uncle (Philip's granduncle) King [[Charles II of Spain]] named Philip as his heir in his will. It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe, such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it. Indeed, Philip's accession in Spain provoked the 13-year [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which continued until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain.\n\nPhilip was the first member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to rule as King of Spain. The sum of his two reigns, 45 years and 21 days, is the longest in modern Spanish history.\n\n==Early years==\nPhilip was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]]<ref>''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'', p. 14. Published by Dodd, Mead and Company, 1903.</ref> in France as the second son of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], the heir apparent to the throne of France, and his wife [[Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria]],<ref name=kamen>Kamen, Henry. \"Philip V of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice\", Published by Yale University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-300-08718-7}}</ref> known as the ''Dauphine Victoire''. He was a younger brother of [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]], the father of [[Louis XV of France]]. At birth, Philip was created [[List of Angevin monarchs|Duke of Anjou]], a traditional title for younger sons in the French royal family. He would be known by this name until he became the King of Spain. Since Philip's older brother, the Duke of Burgundy, was second in line to the French throne after his father, there was little expectation that either he or his younger brother [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686-1714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]], would ever rule over France.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nPhilip lived his first years under the supervision of the royal governess [[Louise de Prie]] and after that was tutored with his brothers by [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon]], Archbishop of [[Cambrai]]. The three were also educated by [[Paul de Beauvilliers, 2nd duc de Saint-Aignan|Paul de Beauvilliers]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Claims to the Spanish throne===\n[[File:Philippe de France proclam\u00e9 roi d'Espagne.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Proclamation of Philip V as King of Spain in the Palace of Versailles on November 16, 1700]]\n\nIn 1700, King [[Charles II of Spain]] died childless. His will named as successor Philip, grandson of Charles' half-sister [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the first wife of Louis XIV.<ref name=kamen/> Upon any possible refusal, the crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother, the Duke of Berry, then to the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]], later Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.<ref name=kamen/> Philip had the better genealogical claim to the Spanish throne, because his Spanish [[Maria Theresa of Spain|grandmother]] and [[Anne of Austria|great-grandmother]] were older than the ancestors of the Archduke Charles of Austria. However, the Austrians maintained that Philip's grandmother had renounced the Spanish throne for herself and her descendants as part of her marriage contract. The French claimed that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.<ref>Durant, Will. \"The Age of Louis XIV\", p. 699. Simon and Schuster, New York, 1963.</ref>\n\nAfter a long Royal Council meeting in France at which the Dauphin spoke up in favour of his son's rights, it was agreed that Philip would ascend the throne, but he would forever renounce his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants.<ref name=kamen/> The Royal Council decided to accept the provisions of the will of Charles II naming Philip, [[King of Spain]], and the Spanish ambassador was called in and introduced to his new king. The ambassador, along with his son, knelt before Philip and made a long speech in Spanish, which Philip did not understand. (Louis XIV, the son and husband of Spanish princesses, did speak Spanish, but Philip learned only later.){{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\n===First marriage===\nOn 2 November 1701, the almost 18-year-old Philip married the 13-year-old [[Maria Luisa of Savoy]], as chosen by his grandfather King Louis XIV. She was the daughter of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy]], and his wife [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]], Philip's first cousin once removed.  The Duke and Duchess of Savoy were also the parents of [[Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy]], Duchess of Burgundy, Philip's sister-in-law. There was a proxy ceremony at [[Turin]], the capital of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and another one at Versailles on 11 September.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\nMaria Luisa proved very popular as Queen of Spain. She served as regent for her husband on several occasions. Her most successful term was when Philip was away touring his Italian domains for nine months in 1702, when she was just 14 years old. On entering Naples that year he was presented with Bernini's ''[[Boy with a Dragon]]'' by [[Carlo Barberini]]. In 1714, Maria Luisa died at the age of 26 from [[tuberculosis]], a devastating emotional blow to her husband.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\n==War of the Spanish Succession==\n{{Main article|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Mel\u00e9ndez, Miguel Jacinto - Philip V, king of Spain, in suit of hunt - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip V of Spain in hunting attire]]\n[[File:Vendome-and-PhilipV.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip (right) at the [[Battle of Villaviciosa]]]]\n[[File:X\u00e0tiva.

In February 1701, Louis XIV caused the ''[[Parlement]]'' of Paris (a court) to register a decree that if Philip's elder brother, the [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy|''Petit Dauphin'' Louis]], died without an heir, then Philip would surrender the throne of Spain for the succession to the throne of France, ensuring dynastic continuity in Europe's greatest land power.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, a second act of the French king \"justified a hostile interpretation\": pursuant to a treaty with Spain, Louis occupied several towns in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (modern Belgium and [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]]). This was the spark that ignited the powder keg created by the unresolved issues of the [[War of the League of Augsburg]] (1689\u201397) and the acceptance of the Spanish inheritance by Louis XIV for his grandson.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlmost immediately the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. Concern among other European powers that Spain and France united under a single Bourbon monarch would upset the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] pitted powerful France and weak Spain against the Grand Alliance of England, the Netherlands and Austria.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685\u20131715'' (1962)</ref>\n\nInside Spain, the [[Crown of Castile]] supported Philip of France. On the other hand, the majority of the nobility of the [[Crown of Aragon]] supported [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]], son of Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] and claimant to the Spanish throne by right of his grandmother [[Maria Anna of Spain]]. Charles was even hailed as King of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] under the name Charles III.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe war was centred in Spain and west-central Europe (especially the [[Low Countries]]), with other important fighting in Germany and Italy. [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] distinguished themselves as military commanders in the Low Countries. In colonial North America, the conflict became known to the English colonists who fought against French and Spanish forces as [[Queen Anne's War]]. Over the course of the fighting, some 400,000 people were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/wars18c.htm |title=Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Eighteenth Century|author= Matthew White |publisher=Users.erols.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this war as a backdrop that, beginning in 1707, Philip issued the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], which centralized Spanish rule under the Castilian political and administrative model and in the process abolished the charters of all independently administered kingdoms within Spain\u2014most notably the [[Crown of Aragon]], which was supporting Charles VI in the conflict\u2014except for the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and the rest of the Basque region, who had supported Philip in the war for the Spanish throne, and retained their [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|semi-autonomous self-government]]. The policy of centralization had as model the [[France|French State]] under [[Louis XIV]] and was strongly supported by politicians such as [[Joseph de Sol\u00eds]] and the [[Sardinia|Sardinian-born]] [[political philosopher]] [[Vicente Bacallar]].<ref>Enrico Bogliolo, ''Tradizione e innovazione nel pensiero politico di Vincenzo Bacallar'', Turin, 1987, ''passim'' (in Italian).</ref>\n\nAt one point in 1712 Philip was offered the choice of renouncing the throne of Spain so that he could be made heir of France, but he refused.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nPhilip decided to relinquish his right of succession to France under one condition: the introduction of [[semi-Salic law]] in Spain. Under this law, the succession to the Spanish crown was limited to his entire male line before it could pass to any female, a condition of his renunciation made clear to the allies during the preliminaries of the Treaties of Utrecht. It was not until this was successfully accomplished (10 May 1713) that Spain and Great Britain made their own peace terms at the second Treaty of Utrecht (annexing the new law to the Treaty). By the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] that concluded the war, Philip was recognized as king of Spain but Spain was forced to cede [[Menorca]] and [[Gibraltar]] to Great Britain; the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Naples]], [[Milan]], and [[Sardinia]] to the Austrian [[Habsburg]]s; and [[Sicily]] and parts of [[Milan]] to [[Savoy]].<ref>J. S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 6: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25'' (1970) ch 13\u201314</ref>\n\nThese losses greatly diminished the Spanish Empire in Europe, which had already been in decline. Throughout his reign, Philip sought to reverse the decline of Spanish power. Trying to overturn the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, he attempted to re-establish Spanish claims in Italy, triggering the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718\u20131720) in which Spain fought a coalition of four major powers. Phillip V was forced to sue for peace.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Second marriage===\nShortly after the death of Queen Maria Luisa in 1714, the King decided to marry again. His second wife was [[Elisabeth of Parma]], daughter of [[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma]], and [[Dorothea Sophie of the Palatinate]]. At the age of 22, on 24 December 1714, she was married to the 31-year-old Philip by proxy in [[Parma]]. The marriage was arranged by [[Giulio Alberoni|Cardinal Alberoni]], with the concurrence of the [[Marie Anne de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins|Princesse des Ursins]], the ''[[Camarera mayor de Palacio]]'' (\"chief of the household\") of the king of Spain.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Abdication===\n[[File:Breech loading firearm belonged to Philip V of Spain by A Tienza Madrid circa 1715.jpg|thumb|A breech loading [[miquelet]] musket with a reusable cartridge, used by Philip V, made by A. Tienza, Madrid, circa 1715]]\n\nOn 14 January 1724, Philip abdicated the throne to his eldest son, the seventeen-year-old [[Louis I of Spain|Louis]], for reasons still subject to debate. One theory suggests that Philip V, who exhibited many elements of mental instability during his reign, did not wish to reign due to his increasing mental decline.<ref>p358, E.N. Williams, The Penguin Dictionary of English and European History</ref> A second theory puts the abdication in context of the Bourbon dynasty. The French royal family recently had lost many legitimate agnates to diseases. Indeed, Philip V's abdication occurred just over a month after the death of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who had been regent for [[Louis XV]] of France. The lack of an heir made another continental war of succession a possibility. Philip V was a legitimate descendant of Louis XIV, but matters were complicated by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which forbade a union of the French and Spanish crowns. The theory supposes that Philip V hoped that by abdicating the Spanish crown he could circumvent the Treaty and succeed to the French throne.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn any case, Louis died on 31 August 1724 in [[Madrid]] of [[smallpox]], having reigned only seven months and leaving no issue. Philip was forced to return to the Spanish throne as his younger son, the later [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]], was not yet of age.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Later reign==\n[[File:FelipVTomba.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Philip V and Elizabeth Farnese in the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, in the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]] ([[Segovia]]).]]\n\nPhilip helped his Bourbon relatives to make territorial gains in the [[War of the Polish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] by reconquering Naples and Sicily from Austria and [[Oran]] from the [[Ottomans]]. Finally, at the end of his reign Spanish forces also successfully defended their American territories from a large British invasion during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u20131748).{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring Philip's reign, Spain began to recover from the stagnation it had suffered during the twilight of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] dynasty. Although the population of Spain grew, the financial and taxation systems were archaic and the treasury ran deficits. The king employed thousands of highly paid retainers at his palaces\u2014not to rule the country but to look after the royal family. The army and bureaucracy went months without pay and only the shipments of silver from the New World kept the system going. Spain suspended payments on its debt in 1739\u2014effectively declaring bankruptcy.<ref>John Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain 1700\u20131808'' (1989) pp 109\u2013113</ref>\n\n===Death===\nPhilip was afflicted by fits of manic depression and increasingly fell victim to a deep melancholia.<ref name=\"Joan\"/> His second wife, Elizabeth Farnese, completely dominated her passive husband.

Lynch says Philip V advanced the government only marginally over that of his predecessors and was more of a liability than the incapacitated Charles II. When a conflict came up between the interests of Spain and France, he usually favored France. However Philip did make some reforms in government, and strengthened the central authorities relative to the provinces. Merit became more important, although most senior positions still went to the landed aristocracy. Below the elite level, the inefficiency and corruption that had existed under Charles II was as widespread as ever. The reforms started by Philip V culminated in much more important reforms of Charles III.<ref>Lynch (1989) pp 67- 115</ref> The economy, on the whole, improved over the previous half-century, with greater productivity, and fewer famines and epidemics   The government promoted industry, agriculture and shipbuilding.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1871302|last1 = Hamilton|first1 = Earl J.|title = Money and Economic Recovery in Spain under the First Bourbon, 1701-1746|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 15|issue = 3|pages = 192\u2013206|year = 1943|doi = 10.1086/236742}}</ref> After the destruction of the main silver fleet at Vigo in 1702, the Navy was rebuilt.

During this Atlantic trade emerged important figures of the naval history of Spain, among which stands out the [[Pirate|corsair]] [[Amaro Pargo]]. Philip V frequently benefited the corsair in his commercial incursions and corsairs: he granted a Royal order given at the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]] in [[Madrid]] in September 1714, in which he appointed him captain of a commercial ship bound for [[Caracas]].<ref name=\"DocsAmaro\">{{Cite book| publisher = Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Provincial de Santa Cruz de Tenerife| isbn = 978-84-7947-637-3| last1 = De Paz S\u00e1nchez| first1 = Manuel| last2 = Garc\u00eda Pulido| first2 = Daniel| others = Francisco Javier Mac\u00edas Mart\u00edn (ed.)| title = El corsario de Dios.

However, when she witnesses Carrie being humiliated by the other girls in the locker room after gym class for her hysterical reaction at her [[menarche|first period]], she realizes that it is the girl\u2019s first menstruation and that Carrie is oblivious to what is happening to her, and feels sorry for her along with confusion as to why her mother never informed her on it. Desjardin wants to punish the girls who taunted Carrie by having them suspended for three days and banned from the upcoming senior prom, but the principal settles on a lesser punishment: a week of boot-camp style detention in the gym. In Desjardin's view, the only reason the administrators didn't go along with her proposed punishment is that they are all men (unaware that they are all intimidated by Chris' father who is a prominent lawyer), and thus didn't really understand just how nasty the girls' behavior had been. Lead bully Christine \u201cChris\u201d Hargensen defiantly skips the detention and thus is banned from attending the prom. The principal reprimands Miss Desjardin for cursing at Chris, but stands by her when Chris' father threatens to sue unless Chris is allowed to attend the prom, unless Desjardin is fired from her job. Meanwhile, [[Sue Snell]], another girl who participated in the locker room tormentation of Carrie, feels remorse for her actions and thus asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom to make amends.\n\nAt the prom, Desjardin talks with Carrie about her own prom night and later, congratulates her for being voted Prom Queen. As revenge for being banned from prom, Chris has secretly rigged a cord connected to two buckets hidden above the stage where Carrie and Tommy will sit on the thrones. When Chris pulls the cord, both of the buckets tip over, drenching them both with pigs' blood. Desjardin reflexively responds to the prank by laughing. However, she later tries to help Carrie, who pushes her aside with her [[telekinesis]], because she [[telepathy|telepathically]] sees that deep down Miss Desjardin is still laughing at her. Once outside, Carrie uses her telekinetic abilities to wreak havoc on the school with the intention of killing everyone in the gymnasium. She then destroys the entire town on the way home. Desjardin is one of the few survivors of the \"Black Prom\".\n\nTwo weeks after the disaster, and with 440 people dead, Desjardin retires from teaching, saying she is consumed with guilt for not doing more to help Carrie and that she would rather commit suicide than ever teach again.

The NITI Aayog council comprises all the state [[Chief minister|Chief Ministers]], along with the Chief Ministers of [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]], the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar, and a vice-chairman nominated by the Prime Minister. In addition, temporary members are selected from leading universities and research institutions. These members include a chief executive officer, four ex-official members, and two part-time members.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Planning Commission (India)}}\n29 May 2014Independent Evaluation Office submitted an assessment report to Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] with the recommendation to replace the Planning Commission with a  \"control commission.\" On 13 August 2014, the Union Cabinet scrapped the Planning Commission, to be replaced with a diluted version of the [[National Advisory Council]] (NAC) of India. On 1 January 2015, a Cabinet resolution was passed to replace the Planning Commission with the newly formed NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India).  Union Government of India announced the formation of NITI Aayog on 1 January 2015. The first meeting of NITI Aayog was chaired by [[Narendra Modi]] on 8 February 2015.\n\nFinance Minister [[Arun Jaitley]] made the following observation on the necessity of creating NITI Aayog, \"The 65-year-old Planning Commission had become a redundant organisation. It was relevant in a command economy structure, but not any longer. India is a diversified country and its states are in various phases of economic development along with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this context, a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to economic planning is obsolete. It cannot make India competitive in today's global economy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/we-will-use-every-provision-in-the-constitution-to-push-r|title=We will use every provision in the Constitution to push reforms|website=www.openthemagazine.com}}</ref>\nIt is a reformation scheme of the day-to-day lifestyles of the people of India.\n\n== Objectives ==\n# To evolve a shared vision of national development priorities, sectors, and strategies with the active involvement of States in the light of national objectives.\n# To foster cooperative federalism through structured support initiatives and mechanisms with the States on a continuous basis, recognizing that strong States make a strong nation.\n# To develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the village level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of government.\n# To ensure, on areas that are specifically referred to it, that the interests of national security are incorporated in economic strategy and policy.\n# To pay special attention to the sections of our society that may be at risk of not benefiting adequately from economic progress.\n# To design strategic and long term policy and programme frameworks and initiatives, and monitor their progress and their efficacy. The lessons learnt through monitoring and feedback will be used for making innovative improvements, including necessary mid-course corrections.\n# To provide advice and encourage partnerships between key stakeholders and national and international like-minded Think tanks, as well as educational and policy research institutions.\n# To create a knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurial support system through a collaborative community of national and international experts, practitioners and other partners.\n# To offer a platform for resolution of inter-sectoral and inter departmental issues in order to accelerate the implementation of the development agenda.\n# To maintain a state-of-the-art Resource Centre, be a repository of research on good governance and best practices in sustainable and equitable development as well as help their dissemination to stake-holders.\n# To actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of programmes and initiatives, including the identification of the needed resources so as to strengthen the probability of success and scope of delivery.\n# To focus on technology upgradation and capacity building for implementation of programmes and initiatives.\n# To undertake other activities as may be necessary in order to further the execution of the national development agenda, and the objectives mentioned in above.\n\n== NITI Lectures ==\nNITI Aayog has started a new initiative on the advice of Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] called ''NITI Lectures: Transforming India''. The aim of this initiative is to invite globally reputed policy makers, experts, administrators to India to share their knowledge, expertise, experience in policy making and good governance with Indian counterparts.

AIM\u2019s objective is to develop new programmes and policies for fostering innovation in different sectors of the economy, provide platform and collaboration opportunities for different stakeholders, create awareness and create an umbrella structure to oversee innovation ecosystem of the country.\n\nFive major initiatives taken in first year of establishment:\n\nAtal Tinkering Labs-Creating problem solving mindset across schools in India.\nAtal Incubation Centers-Fostering world class startups and adding a new dimension to the incubator model.\nAtal New India Challenges-Fostering product innovations and aligning them to the needs of various sectors/ministeries.\nMentor India Campaign- A national Mentor network in collaboration with public sector, corporates and institutions, to support all the intiatives of the mission.\nAtal Community Innovation Center- To stimulate community centric innovation and ideas in the unserved /underserved regions of the country including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.\nARISE-To stimulate innovation and research in the MSME industry.\n\nBrief on activities carried out under Atal Innovation Mission\n(1) Atal Tinkering Labs:\n\nBackground\n\nWith a vision to \u2018Cultivate one Million children in India as Neoteric Innovators\u2019, Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across India. The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc.\n\nKey Features of ATL\n\nATL is a work space where young minds can give shape to their ideas through hands on do-it-yourself mode; and learn innovation skills. Young children will get a chance to work with tools and equipment to understand the concepts of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). ATL would contain educational and learning \u2018do it yourself\u2019 kits and equipment on \u2013 science, electronics, robotics, open source microcontroller boards, sensors and 3D printers and computers. Other desirable facilities include meeting rooms and video conferencing facility.\n\nIn order to foster inventiveness among students, ATL can conduct different activities ranging from regional and national level competitions, exhibitions, workshops on problem solving, designing and fabrication of products, lecture series etc. at periodic intervals.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nAIM will provide grant-in-aid of Rs. 20 Lakh to each school that includes a one-time establishment cost of Rs. 10 lakh and operational expenses of Rs. 10 lakh for a maximum period of 5 years to each ATL.\n\nEligibility\n\nSchools (minimum Grade VI - X) managed by Government, local body or private trusts/society to set up ATL.\n\n\n(2) Atal Incubation Centre:\n\nBackground\n\nAIM intends to support the establishment of new incubation centres called Atal Incubation Centres (AICs) that would nurture innovative start-up businesses in their pursuit to become scalable and sustainable enterprises. The AICs would create world class incubation facilities across various parts of India with suitable physical infrastructure in terms of capital equipment and operating facilities, coupled with the availability of sectoral experts for mentoring the start-ups, business planning support, access to seed capital, industry partners, trainings and other relevant components required for encouraging innovative start-ups. Moreover, AICs would be established in subject specific areas such as manufacturing, transport, energy, health, education, agriculture, water and sanitation etc.\n\nEligibility\n\nEntities such as such as higher educational institutions, R&D institutes, corporate sector, alternative investment funds registered with SEBI, business accelerators, group of individuals, and individuals are eligible to apply.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nAIM will provide a grant-in-aid of upto Rs. 10 crore for a maximum period of 5 years to cover the capital and operational expenditures to establish the AIC.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe applicant would have to provide at least 10,000 sq. ft. of ready-to-use, built-up space, for the exclusive use of the AIC.\n\n\n(3) Atal New India Challenge (ANIC):\n\nOne of Atal Innovation Mission\u2019s primary goals is to incentivize innovation in areas critical to India\u2019s growth. The innovative solutions in the areas like health, housing, hygiene, energy and water can impact directly on livelihood of all sections of society. Researchers have long talked of the \u2018Valleys of Death\u2019 at the early stage and commercialization stage in taking innovations to market. The Atal New India Challenge aims to address the second Commercialization Valley of Death, in which innovators are unable to access resources for piloting, testing, and market creation. Total of 24 challenges are launched in partnership with five different ministries and departments of central government. (http://aim.gov.in/atal-new-india-challenge.php)\n\nThe vision of ANIC is two-fold:\n\nhelp create products from existing technologies relevant for national and social causes (productization);\nhelp new deep-tech products find markets and early customers (commercialization) in the context of India.\nThe scope of the program extends to developing an institutional mechanism and structure to channel potential innovative ideas for products and technologies from Startups and MSMEs on their own or along with R&D organizations, academic institutions and even individual innovators\n\n\n(4) Mentor of Change Program\n\nMentor of Change Program is a strategic nation building initiative to engage leaders who can guide and mentor students in thousands of Atal Tinkering Labs and startups and incubators under the programs of Atal Innovation Mission across India.

On 1 January 2015, a Cabinet resolution was passed to replace the Planning Commission with the newly formed NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India).  Union Government of India announced the formation of NITI Aayog on 1 January 2015. The first meeting of NITI Aayog was chaired by [[Narendra Modi]] on 8 February 2015.\n\nFinance Minister [[Arun Jaitley]] made the following observation on the necessity of creating NITI Aayog, \"The 65-year-old Planning Commission had become a redundant organisation. It was relevant in a command economy structure, but not any longer. India is a diversified country and its states are in various phases of economic development along with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this context, a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to economic planning is obsolete.

Of [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanian Ukrainian]] or [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] roots, he had a ''[[kulak]]'' mother, whom he openly denounced later in life. Salogor's early career was in agricultural institutions of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], where he also advanced politically. Following the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|Soviet advance]] into [[Bessarabia]] in 1940, he joined the leadership of the [[Moldavian SSR]]. Immediately advanced to Junior Secretary of the PCM, he was co-opted on its [[Politburo]] in early 1941, and took part in a workforce recruitment drive, which is described by historian [[Ion Varta]] as connected to the [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|deportation of native Romanians]].\n\nShortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]], Salogor and other PCM leaders withdrew to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], but still sought to exercise command over [[Moldovan resistance during World War II|partisan units organizing in Bessarabia]]. During this interval, Salogor was able to outmaneuver [[Piotr Borodin]], taking up Borodin's position as First Secretary. He finally returned to Soviet Moldavia in March 1944, and joined the provisional government formed in [[Soroca]]. During and after the region's [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|reconquest in August 1944]], he involved himself in reconstructing the party structures and investigating the spread of anti-communist resistance. He also managed responses to the [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|Moldavian famine]], and set up the [[Moldova State University|Moldavian State University]].\n\nCultivating [[national communism]] and posthumously labelled a [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]], Salogor advanced an [[irredentist]] project, hoping to increase the Moldavian SSR by incorporating the whole of [[Western Moldavia|Romanian Moldavia]], as well as the [[Budjak]] and [[Bukovina]]. These proposals threatened the Ukrainian SSR's territorial integrity, and were as such vetoed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Salogor lost his PCM positions shortly after, and sent to work as an agricultural manager in [[Krasnodar Krai]]. He was allowed to return in 1950, when [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian Premier]] [[Gherasim Rudi]] assigned him minor positions in his cabinet. His attempt to undermine PCM leader [[Nicolae Coval]] resulted in another demotion.

Of [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanian Ukrainian]] or [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] roots, he had a ''[[kulak]]'' mother, whom he openly denounced later in life. Salogor's early career was in agricultural institutions of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], where he also advanced politically. Following the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|Soviet advance]] into [[Bessarabia]] in 1940, he joined the leadership of the [[Moldavian SSR]]. Immediately advanced to Junior Secretary of the PCM, he was co-opted on its [[Politburo]] in early 1941, and took part in a workforce recruitment drive, which is described by historian [[Ion Varta]] as connected to the [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|deportation of native Romanians]].\n\nShortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]], Salogor and other PCM leaders withdrew to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], but still sought to exercise command over [[Moldovan resistance during World War II|partisan units organizing in Bessarabia]]. During this interval, Salogor was able to outmaneuver [[Piotr Borodin]], taking up Borodin's position as First Secretary. He finally returned to Soviet Moldavia in March 1944, and joined the provisional government formed in [[Soroca]]. During and after the region's [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|reconquest in August 1944]], he involved himself in reconstructing the party structures and investigating the spread of anti-communist resistance. He also managed responses to the [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|Moldavian famine]], and set up the [[Moldova State University|Moldavian State University]].\n\nCultivating [[national communism]] and posthumously labelled a [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]], Salogor advanced an [[irredentist]] project, hoping to increase the Moldavian SSR by incorporating the whole of [[Western Moldavia|Romanian Moldavia]], as well as the [[Budjak]] and [[Bukovina]]. These proposals threatened the Ukrainian SSR's territorial integrity, and were as such vetoed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Salogor lost his PCM positions shortly after, and sent to work as an agricultural manager in [[Krasnodar Krai]]. He was allowed to return in 1950, when [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian Premier]] [[Gherasim Rudi]] assigned him minor positions in his cabinet.

It has an effect that mimics the multiplication ability of the mythological version. If it is destroyed by another card's effect, you can add another \"Nordic Relic\" card to your hand. The art represents it as an arm brace, with another brace seemingly growing from it, once again mimicking the story.\n\n''DRAUPNIR'' was revealed as the key to a website that [[Neal Caffrey]] and [[Mozzie (White Collar)|Mozzie]] used to view their stolen Nazi U-boat treasure in \"Taking Account\", the seventh episode of the third season of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''.\n\nIt also appeared in episode 11 of ''[[Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold]]'' as a tool to seal Loki's spirit.\n\nThe Draupnir is never called by name but is simply known as Odin's ring in the first three books of the [[Witches of East End]] novels.

It was offered as a gift by [[Freyr]]'s servant [[Sk\u00edrnir]] in the wooing of [[Ger\u00f0r]], which is described in the poem ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nDraupnir is represented as a card in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game]]. It has an effect that mimics the multiplication ability of the mythological version. If it is destroyed by another card's effect, you can add another \"Nordic Relic\" card to your hand. The art represents it as an arm brace, with another brace seemingly growing from it, once again mimicking the story.\n\n''DRAUPNIR'' was revealed as the key to a website that [[Neal Caffrey]] and [[Mozzie (White Collar)|Mozzie]] used to view their stolen Nazi U-boat treasure in \"Taking Account\", the seventh episode of the third season of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''.\n\nIt also appeared in episode 11 of ''[[Saint Seiya: Soul of Gold]]'' as a tool to seal Loki's spirit.\n\nThe Draupnir is never called by name but is simply known as Odin's ring in the first three books of the [[Witches of East End]] novels. This rings allows the wearer to teleport to any place of the nine worlds, and a copy of equal power was once owned by Loki before it was destroyed by Freya.\n\n==Notes==\n{{commons category|Draupnir}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Orchard, Andy (1997).

Counting these along with its two teams in Major League Soccer, the New York metropolitan area is home to a total of 11 organizations competing in the five most prestigious professional sports leagues in the United States, and have been crowned champions of their respective leagues on a combined 53 occasions.  As of 2019, five of the Metropolitan Area's nine \"Big Four\" franchises play their full schedules within the New York City limits.\n\nIn addition, Queens is host of tennis' [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments.

The [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]] have played in New York since 1903.

The [[New York Mets]] have represented New York in the [[National League]] since 1962. The Mets play in [[Citi Field]] in [[Flushing, Queens]] and have won five NL pennants and two World Series, thus making them one of the most decorated expansion teams in Major League Baseball. The \"[[Subway Series]]\" is the name used for all regular season and World Series meetings between the two teams. Before [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997, the only instance these two teams could have played each other would have been in the World Series.

[[Negro league baseball]] teams also were present in New York, including the [[Brooklyn Royal Giants]], [[Newark Stars]], [[Lincoln Giants]], [[Newark Browns]], [[New York Black Yankees]], [[New York Cubans]], and the [[Newark Eagles]].\n\nIn 1858 in [[Corona, Queens]], at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all-stars of [[Brooklyn]], including players from the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], [[Excelsior of Brooklyn]], Putnams and [[Eckford of Brooklyn]], and the All Stars of New York ([[Manhattan]]), including players from the [[New York Knickerbockers]], Gothams (predecessors of the [[San Francisco Giants]]), Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to the first all-star baseball games.<ref>The 1858 Fashion Race Course Baseball Match, Baseball Almanac, http://www.baseball-almanac.com/treasure/autont2006b.shtml Accessed August 5, 2013</ref>\n\nTwo historical clubs, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]], were among the most storied clubs in professional baseball, and were home to such players as [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Willie Mays]].

The NIT has spawned a major early-season tournament known as the [[NIT Season Tip-Off]]; the semifinal and final rounds of that event are also held at the Garden.\n\nAt Madison Square Garden, New Yorkers can watch the [[New York Knicks]] play [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball. Through the 2017 [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] season, the [[New York Liberty]] also played at the Garden, but that team's main home has changed twice since then. First, the team moved to [[Westchester County Center]] in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] in 2018. Then, after the team's 2019 purchase by [[Joseph Tsai|the owner]] of the NBA's [[Brooklyn Nets]], the Liberty will move to the Nets' home of [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] from 2020 forward. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct [[American Basketball Association]] with the NBA during the 1976\u201377 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home arena ([[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two-time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward [[Julius Erving]]. During the first season of the merger (1976\u201377), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012\u201313 NBA season.\n[[File:Barclays Center western side.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Barclays Center]], home of the [[Brooklyn Nets]], [[New York Islanders]], and [[New York Liberty]] in Brooklyn]]\n\nThe Knicks have won two NBA titles (1969\u201370 and 1972\u201373).  The 1970 title was particularly memorable, as there was a question before the pivotal Game 7 in Madison Square Garden as to whether star center [[Willis Reed]] of the Knicks, who had been injured in Game 5 and missed Game 6, would be able to play.  But after both teams had already begun their pre-game shooting practice and warm-ups, Reed suddenly appeared at the court in uniform before an astonished crowd at Madison Square Garden, and when the game began, he started at center and hit the first two baskets for the Knicks, inspiring his team to a 113\u201399 victory. Reed's inspiring appearance in Game 7 is usually considered among the most dramatic sequences in NBA history and ranks third in the [[NBA 60 Greatest Playoff Moments]].   Despite the Knicks' comparative lack of championships, NBA lore has been enriched with the team's many exciting playoff battles through the years with such fierce rivals as the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe [[Long Island Nets]], an [[NBA G League]] team, started playing at the Barclays Center in 2016 before moving to [[Nassau Coliseum]] in 2017. The [[Westchester Knicks]] started in 2014 at the Westchester County Center.\n\n[[Rucker Park]] in [[Harlem]] is a celebrated court where many NBA athletes play in the summer league.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s headquarters are located in New York City, at [[Fifth Avenue]]'s [[Olympic Tower]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerej.com/33634 |title=Seherr-Thoss of FirstService Williams negotiates 153,405 s/f lease; Assisted by Jaccom, Freedman, Plehn and Plakopita |publisher=Nerej.com |accessdate=October 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114155923/http://nerej.com/33634 |archivedate=January 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Liberty]] are one of the original teams of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], which was formed in 1997.  The team's main venue moved from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center after the 2017 season, and then to Barclays Center after the 2019 season. During a massive renovation project at the arena between 2011 and 2013, the Liberty temporarily played their home games at the [[Prudential Center]] in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, the [[Newark Bears (basketball)|Newark Bears]] team played. They changed their name to the Newark Mules.\n\nThere was briefly a [[Long Island Ducks (basketball)|Long Island Ducks basketball]] team at the [[Long Island Arena]] in 1977\u20131978.\n\n[[Long Island PrimeTime]] played at [[Louis Armstrong Gymnasium]] in Flushing from 2006\u20132007. They were part of the [[United States Basketball League]].\n\n===American football===\n[[File:Meadowlands stadium parking lot.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[MetLife Stadium]], home to both the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]]]]\nSince 2010 both the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]] play in [[MetLife Stadium]] in nearby [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] near New York City. In 2014 the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. The Giants and Jets were previously located in New York City (both teams played in the Polo Grounds and Shea Stadium, and the Giants played in Yankee Stadium). Neither team plays in the city itself presently, as both teams are located in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in East Rutherford, New Jersey, playing in [[Giants Stadium]] for many years before moving to MetLife Stadium. The Giants, a keystone [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise, were founded in 1925, and exist today as one of the oldest presently active organizations in the NFL. Due to their long-spanning establishment and richer tradition of on-field success, as compared to the Jets, of the two teams, many consider the Giants to be the more popular. Founded in 1960, the originally named New York Titans, later branded as the Jets in 1963, were a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), joining the NFL as part of the AFL/NFL merger in 1970.\n\nNew York City also had many historical professional teams.  The first professional team in New York was called both the [[New York Brickley Giants|New York Giants and Brooklyn Giants]] (unrelated to the current New York Giants), and played in the predecessor to the NFL, the [[American Professional Football Association]], in 1921. In 1926, the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], [[Newark Bears (AFL)]] and [[Brooklyn Horsemen]] played in the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]], and on the same year, the [[Brooklyn Lions]] played in the [[National Football League]] before the Horsemen and Lions merged in November and folded at season's end. The Lions' NFL franchise rights were given to the Yankees, who competed in the NFL from 1927 to 1928. When the Yankees folded, its rights were given to the existing barnstorming team [[Staten Island Stapletons]], who played in the NFL until 1932 when it stopped league play and later folded as well.\n\nIn 1930, the NFL [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] began play at Ebbets Field. The team lasted until 1944, calling themselves the Brooklyn Tigers that last season but going winless. In 1945, the team was merged with the [[Boston Yanks]] and played one more home game in Brooklyn that season as the Yanks.\n\nAnother team going by the name [[New York Yankees (1936 AFL)|New York Yankees]] played in the second AFL in 1936 and 1937. The league also had a [[Rochester Tigers|Brooklyn Tigers]] club in 1936, but the team never played in Brooklyn and folded after only seven games. A [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|third incarnation of the Yankees]] played in the third AFL in 1940 under the Yankees name, and then in 1941 as the [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)#New York Americans|New York Americans]]. Another version of the New York Yankees was a short-lived member of the [[American Association (football)|American Association]]\n\nIn 1946, the new [[All-America Football Conference]] had yet another set of [[Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] teams. These clubs lasted until 1948, after which they merged with each other.  The renamed Brooklyn-New York Yankees folded after one season when the [[AAFC\u2013NFL merger|AAFC merged with the NFL]].\n\nThe [[New York Yanks|New York Bulldogs]] were founded in 1949, sharing the [[Polo Grounds]] with the New York Giants, and then being renamed as the New York Yanks and playing in the NFL in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. In 1952, the team was relocated to Texas and renamed as the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]].\n\nIn 1974, New York briefly hosted a team known as the [[Charlotte Hornets (WFL)|New York Stars]] for the short-lived [[World Football League]], but in mid-season the team was relocated to Charlotte and became the [[Charlotte Hornets (WFL)|Charlotte Hornets]].\n\nThe short-lived [[United States Football League]] had a team in the New York area. The [[New Jersey Generals]] played at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|The Meadowlands]] from 1983 to 1985. At one point, the team was owned by future [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]]. The team folded with the rest of the league.\n\nIn 1988, the [[New York Knights (arena football)|New York Knights]] played for one season as part of the [[Arena Football League]], and then ceased operations. In 1997, the AFL added two expansion franchises, the [[Toronto Phantoms|New York CityHawks]], who played at Madison Square Garden, and the [[New Jersey Red Dogs]], who played in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. The CityHawks moved to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and were renamed the New England Sea Wolves in 1999, and then relocated to Toronto in 2001, and renamed the Toronto Phantoms. The Red Dogs were renamed the New Jersey Gladiators in 2001, then relocated and became the Las Vegas Gladiators in 2003, before relocating again and being renamed the Cleveland Gladiators. When the Sea Wolves, who were owned by the [[Madison Square Garden Company]] and had their games televised in New York City on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], relocated to Toronto, the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers relocated to Long Island and were renamed the [[New York Dragons]]. The Dragons played in New York until 2008, when the league suspended operations; no team from New York (either the city or the state) played in the league from its 2010 revival until the [[Albany Empire (AFL)|Albany Empire]], based in the state's capital, joined the AFL in 2018.\n\n[[File:Aerial view Shea Stadium with Manhattan in background 1981.jpg|thumb|Shea Stadium and vicinity, with [[Manhattan]] in the background, 1981]]\nThe Jets are sometimes regarded as \"''Long Island's Team''\" supported by the fact that until 2008, the team trained in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]] at [[Hofstra University]], and used to play at [[Shea Stadium]] (former home of the [[New York Mets]] baseball team) which is close to Nassau County.

The Guardians are New York's second XFL team, the short-lived original [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] in 2001 led to the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] playing at [[Giants Stadium]] until the league folded.

Established in 1999 the Sharks are the longest-running and winningest team in women's tackle football having won 3 conference titles (2002, 2003, 2004 IWFL East), 6 division titles (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 IWFL) and one championship title (2002 IWFL). The Sharks play at many fields and have no official home stadium.  The season for women's football is from April to June with playoffs and the championship game occurring from June to July. As of 2011 the Sharks are now with the WFA (Women's Football Alliance [http://wfafootball.com/]) along with the Bay Area Bandits, Boston Militia, Chicago Force, Dallas Diamonds, DC Divas, Kansas City Tribe, Pittsburgh Passion, and the San Diego Surge in an effort to bring together the best franchises of women's football.\n\nThe [[National Football League|NFL]]'s headquarters are located in New York City, at [[345 Park Avenue]] in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schefter|first=Adam |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/10spot-11week3/remembering-hit-drew-bledose-led-emergence-tom-brady |title=Remembering the hit on Drew Bledose that led to the emergence of Tom Brady |publisher=ESPN |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Ice hockey===\n[[File:NVMC 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Nassau Coliseum]] in Uniondale, was home to the [[New York Islanders]] from 1972\u20132015, and the [[New York Nets]] from 1972\u20131976.]]\n[[Ice hockey]] has a storied history and large following in the New York metropolitan area, which is unique in being the only metropolitan area and media market in the United States and Canada to feature three major league professional teams participating in the same sport. New York City is currently the full-time home to the [[New York Rangers]], playing in [[Madison Square Garden]] in Manhattan, and part-time home to the [[New York Islanders]], which currently split their home schedule between [[Barclays Center]] in Brooklyn and [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in the [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] community of [[Uniondale, New York]]. The [[New Jersey Devils]] play in [[Prudential Center]] in nearby [[Newark, New Jersey]]. All three teams are historically division rivals, having all been in the same division since the Devils moved to New Jersey from [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Denver]] in 1982. Currently, they play in the [[Metropolitan Division (NHL)|Metropolitan Division]].\n\nThe Rangers, established in 1926, are one of the [[Original Six]] \u2014 a term given to the six NHL teams in existence before the league [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled its size]] in 1967. The primary fan base for the Rangers is in the City's five boroughs, [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], much of Upstate New York, and parts of Connecticut, however they maintain a sizable following within parts of the market claimed by their two local rivals.\n\nThe Islanders, established in 1972, moved their home games to the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]] and provide their fans with an [[Islanders-Rangers rivalry|intense rivalry with the Rangers]]. The Islanders' primary fan base is in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties on [[Long Island]]. The Islanders are planning to return to Nassau County by way of a [[Belmont Park Arena|new arena]] currently scheduled to open for the 2021\u201322 season near the [[Belmont Park]] horse racing track in [[Elmont, New York]], adjacent to Queens. In the interim, the Islanders will be playing approximately half of their regular season schedule at the newly-renovated Nassau Coliseum in anticipation of the return to their traditional home jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/islanders/schedule/|title=New York Islanders 2018-19 schedule|via=NHL.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Devils, established in 1982, provide area hockey fans with yet another [[Devils-Rangers rivalry|intense rivalry]] involving the Rangers largely stemming from geographic proximity, a manifestation of a long-standing rivalry between the states of New York and New Jersey, and six playoff meetings in which the Rangers have won four. Both teams have achieved famous results for their respective fan bases in these meetings, including the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 Eastern Conference Finals]], ending in a dramatic double-overtime goal by the Rangers' [[St\u00e9phane Matteau]] during the 7th and deciding game. The Devils took a 3\u20132 series lead into Game 6 in New Jersey and jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead in the game. However, [[Mark Messier]]'s famous guarantee and [[hat-trick]] led the Rangers to victory and a seventh game. As time wound down in Game 7, the Rangers were clinging to a 1\u20130 lead when New Jersey's [[Valeri Zelepukin]] tied the game with 7.7 seconds left in regulation to silence the Garden crowd and send the game into overtime, where Matteau won it for the Rangers. Most recently, in the [[2012 Stanley Cup playoffs|2012 Eastern Conference Finals]], the Rangers would be in a very similar scenario, but would ultimately fail to overcome the 3\u20132 series deficit after trailing 2-0 and forcing overtime in Game 6 across the Hudson River at [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] on a series-winning goal only 1:03 into overtime by [[Adam Henrique]]. The Devils' primary fan base resides throughout Northern and Central New Jersey.\n\nThe Islanders and Rangers had a bitter rivalry in the 1970s and the 1980s, as the Islanders won four consecutive [[Stanley Cup]] titles; the Rangers won their most recent NHL championship in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals]], the fourth Cup victory in that team's history. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs, with the Islanders winning five of those matchups. Incidentally, as the Islanders and Devils have had little success simultaneously (the Devils\u2019 Stanley Cup success occurred in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s) throughout their respective histories and have faced off in the playoffs only once in the [[1987-88 NHL Season|1987-88 season]] in a series won by the Devils, this rivalry is perceived as an afterthought in the area particularly when compared to the Rangers\u2019 rivalries with the Islanders and Devils.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Riveters]], established in 2015, are one of the four charter members of the [[National Women's Hockey League (2015\u2013)|National Women's Hockey League]]. They play their homes games in the [[Prudential Center|Barnabas Health Hockey House]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barnabashealthhockeyhouse.com/|title=RWJ Barnabas Health Hockey House|website=barnabashealthhockeyhouse.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref> at the Prudential Center in Newark beginning with the [[2016\u201317 NWHL season]]. In 2017, the Riveters announced they were partnering with the New Jersey Devils becoming the first NWHL team to officially partner with an NHL team. In 2018, the Riveters won their first [[Isobel Cup]] title.\n\nNew York City also had a historical NHL team, the [[New York Americans]] (also known as the Amerks, and in 1941\u201342, the Brooklyn Americans), who played between 1925 and 1942. They were the first hockey team to play in the city, and for most of the life of the franchise shared Madison Square Garden with the Rangers. The franchise was never a big winner, and disbanded during World War II due to financial problems and a depleted roster. The [[World Hockey Association]] team called the [[New York Raiders]] and later the [[New York Golden Blades]] played at Madison Square Garden and [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] from 1972 until 1974 when they moved to San Diego. A few historical minor league hockey teams played in the New York area in the [[Eastern Hockey League]].  The [[New York Rovers]] started as a farm team of the Rangers in 1935 playing at Madison Square Garden. They moved to the [[Long Island Arena]] in 1959 and became the [[Long Island Ducks (ice hockey)]] until 1973. The [[New York Bobcats]] are a USA Hockey-Sanctioned Tier III Junior Ice Hockey Team at Twin Rinks in Eisenhower Park from 2000 to the present. The [[New York Apple Core]] are a Tier III Junior A Ice Hockey Team in Brewster, New York.\n\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s headquarters are also located in New York City, at the [[Exxon Building (New York)|Exxon Building]] in [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/realestate/commercial/27sqft.html|title=A Frosty Headquarters for the N.H.L.|first=Claire|last=Wilson|date=July 27, 2008|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Soccer===\nProfessional soccer, as in the rest of the country, is rapidly growing in popularity in New York. The [[New York Red Bulls]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (originally known as the \"MetroStars\" until the team's purchase by Austrian corporation [[Red Bull GmbH]] in 2006) have played in the metropolitan area since the league's founding in 1996. Since 2010 they have played at [[Red Bull Arena (MLS)|Red Bull Arena]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Harrison, New Jersey]] with a capacity of just over 25,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullarena.us/arena/default.aspx |title=About Red Bull Arena |publisher=Redbullarena.us |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref> The Red Bulls have won the [[Supporters' Shield]], awarded to the MLS regular season champion, on three occasions, most recently in [[2018 Major League Soccer season|2018]].\n\nOn May 21, 2013, MLS announced that the league's 20th team would be [[New York City FC]], jointly owned by the English club [[Manchester City F.C.]] and the baseball team, the [[New York Yankees]].  They began playing in MLS in 2015 at Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. Its eventual home stadium is yet to be determined, although team and city officials have stressed that a location within the five boroughs of New York City will be identified for the construction of a soccer-specific stadium which would be the permanent home stadium for the team.\n\nThe New York City area is also home to the [[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]] of the [[NPSL Members Cup]], whose [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|first iteration]] was arguably the most popular American soccer team ever. Playing in the original [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]], the Cosmos were known for fielding some of the world's greatest players including [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]].

The Mets, who previously played at [[Shea Stadium]], moved into the newly constructed [[Citi Field]] in 2009. Also the current [[Madison Square Garden]], atop [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], is actually the ''fourth'' separate building to use that name; the [[Madison Square Garden (1879)|first]] [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|two]] were near [[Madison Square]], hence the name, and [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|the third]] was at 50th Street and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]].\n\nThe 2000s have seen almost a complete revamping of the area's major sporting venues. This began in 2007, when the Devils moved to [[Newark, New Jersey]], and opened the [[Prudential Center]]. In 2009, both the Mets and Yankees opened new baseball stadiums adjacent to their old homes, with the Mets replacing [[Shea Stadium]] with [[Citi Field]] and the Yankees building a new [[Yankee Stadium]]. In 2010, the Jets and Giants moved to a new shared facility called New Meadowlands Stadium (now [[MetLife Stadium]]) and the Red Bulls opened their own [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Harrison, New Jersey]], called [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]] (the three had previously shared [[Giants Stadium]] in East Rutherford, New Jersey). In 2012, the Nets moved from New Jersey to the [[Barclays Center]] in Brooklyn and became the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The Islanders left Nassau County, and followed the Nets into Brooklyn in 2015.\n\nOther sports-related renovations and construction work is as follows:\n* [[Madison Square Garden]], the home of the Knicks and Rangers, underwent a massive renovation from 2010 to 2013 which finished in time for the 2013\u201314 NHL and NBA seasons.

If you hear about a great lacrosse player, chances are that player has ties to Long Island.  In 2002 more than one-third (4 of 11) of the players on the [[USILA All-American Team|NCAA Division I All-American First Team]] came from Long Island high schools, with 16 Long Islanders honored overall.  In the same year, the NCAA Division II All-American list was virtually all Long Islanders and nearly every NCAA Division I, II and III lacrosse team had at least one player from the area.  In 2002 at the [[2002 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Division I championships]], three of the four men's teams were coached by a Long Islander and all four had a Long Islander as a captain.\n\nBy some accounts, lacrosse was almost as big as baseball in New York City in the first decade of the 20th century. After learning the game in New York City and moving to Long Island, Jason Stranahan started the first high school lacrosse program at [[Manhasset High School]] in 1933; football Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]] played lacrosse at Manhasset and is considered by some as the greatest lacrosse player of all time.   By the 1950s, the sport was embedded across Nassau County but had still failed to reach [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].  [[Huntington High School (New York)|Huntington High School]] fielded that county's first varsity team in 1957.

The race took place on country roads with hundreds of spectators watching cars go by at speeds close to 100 miles per hour. In 1906, several spectators were killed when a car went off the road. Vanderbilt responded quickly by building a 45-mile private highway. Races resumed in 1908, but another accident killed spectators in 1910 making organizers abandon the Long Island course for good. The Vanderbilt Cup returned in 1936 and 1937 at [[Roosevelt Raceway]] in Westbury, Long Island. The 1937 race was one of the greatest races in New York State's history, featuring the only pre-WWII appearance of the German racing team in the United States.

Bird, [[August Belmont]], Benjamin Nicoll, and their associates participated in the first polo match on Long Island. The polo match was played on the infield of the racetrack of the Mineola Fair Grounds.  The Meadowbrook Polo Club, originally located in [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]] and [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]] and currently located in [[Old Westbury, New York|Old Westbury]], was formally incorporated in 1881.   The Meadowbrook Polo Club's first polo field was created in 1884, leading to Long Island's role as \"Polo Capital of the World\" during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBesides Meadowbrook other polo clubs in the area include: Equuleus Polo Club, Shannon Hill Polo Club, [[Greenwich Polo Club]], Princeton University Polo, Fairfield County Hunt Club, North Fork Polo Club.

The main tournament consists of five championships: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, with additional tournaments for junior and wheelchair players.\n\nThe National Tennis Center, open to the public whenever the USTA is not holding an event, features the world's largest stadium built specifically for the sport, the 22,547-seat [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]].\n\nThe [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] began play in [[World TeamTennis]] (WTT) in 2016. Home matches were played at [[Forest Hills Stadium]] in Queens.\n\nOther teams have represented the New York City metropolitan area in WTT in the past. The [[New York Sets]], who changed their name to New York Apples in 1977, were a charter franchise of the league and played from 1974 to 1978. The Sets originally played their home matches at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] before splitting their home schedule between the Coliseum and [[Madison Square Garden]]. By the 1978 season, many home matches were played in the [[Felt Forum]] with those featuring marquee opponents played in the Garden's main arena. The franchise won the league championship in 1976 and 1977, and featured star players [[Billie Jean King]], [[Virginia Wade]], [[Sandy Mayer]] and [[Phil Dent]]. The two title-winning teams were coached by [[Fred Stolle]]. Following the 1978 season, the Apples announced they were folding. Soon afterward, WTT suspended operations, and there were no 1979 or 1980 seasons.\n\nThe [[New Jersey Stars]] joined WTT as an expansion franchise in 1987, playing their home matches in [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey]]. The team went 0\u201314 in its inaugural season but, with a completely remade roster, reached the TeamTennis Final in 1988. Home matches were moved to [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey]] in 1989, when the team was led by [[Tracy Austin]]. The signing of [[Martina Navratilova]] in 1994 produced immediate results on the court as the Stars won the league title in both 1994 and 1995. However, the team was unable to build a fan base and relocated, as two-time defending WTT champions, to become the Delaware Smash for the 1996 season.\n\nThe [[New York Hamptons]] were added as a WTT expansion franchise in 2000, playing their home matches in [[East Quogue, New York]]. They moved to [[Amagansett, New York|Amagansett]] in 2002. In 2003, Sportime NY became the team's majority owner. Home matches were moved to [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and the team's name was changed to the New York Sportimes. Led by [[Martina Hingis]], the Sportimes won the 2005 WTT title. In 2009, the Sportimes moved to New York City, playing their home matches on [[Randall's Island]]. Before the 2011 season, the Sportimes merged with the [[New York Buzz]], which had been based in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]] since 1995. Following the merger, the team played some of its home matches on Randall's Island and others in either [[Albany, New York|Albany]] or [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York. Following the 2013 season, the team was sold, and the new owner relocated it and renamed it the [[San Diego Aviators]]. Ironically, the Aviators won their first league title after relocation in New York City at Forest Hills Stadium, which was selected as the site for the 2016 WTT Final to welcome the expansion [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] to the league.\n\n=== eSports ===\nThe [[New York Excelsior]] (NYXL) is an American professional [[Overwatch (video game)#Professional competition|Overwatch esports]] team based in [[New York City, New York]].

A championship win by any major sports team is considered to be worthy of the highest celebration, including a [[ticker-tape parade]] for the victorious team. In the past, ticker-tape parades have been held for the Yankees, Mets, Giants and Rangers. New Yorkers, however, tend to rally around any of the local teams who win (such as the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994 Stanley Cup champions New York Rangers]], or the [[Super Bowl XLII|2007 New York Giants]]).\n\n==Rivalries==\nDue to their geographic locations, New York has intense sports rivalries with the cities of [[Sports in Boston|Boston]] and [[Sports in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]].\n\n===Boston===\n{{See also|Sports in Boston|Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|Celtics\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nDecades before professional baseball became popular, New York and Boston claimed distinctive versions of [[bat-and-ball games]]. A variant of baseball known as [[The Massachusetts Game]] was played in New England in the 1850s, while New York teams played by the [[Knickerbocker Rules]] set up by [[Alexander Cartwright]]. The New York rules eventually became the basis for the modern sport of baseball.\n\nTeams in Boston and New York offer some of the best rivalries in their respective sports, none are more famous, however, then the longtime feud between the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. The viciousness and fierceness of the rivalry has led to the New York\u2013Boston rivalry being evident between the [[Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|New York Jets and the New England Patriots]] in the [[National Football League]] and the [[National Basketball Association rivalries|New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics]] in the [[National Basketball Association]].<ref name=NewYorkBoston>{{cite news|title=Baseball's Fault Lines Show Stress In Arizona|date=February 2, 2008|first=Dan|last=Steinberg|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=E11|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/01/AR2008020103259_pf.html}}</ref> The [[New York Rangers]] have been longtime rivals with the [[Boston Bruins]] also due to the fact that both teams are members of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Original Six]] franchises, but this has been eclipsed by the [[Metropolitan Division]] rivalries in recent years.\n\nThe rivalry has also spread to other teams not in the same league, The [[1986 World Series]] between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] is considered a classic especially the 6th game and the famous [[Bill Buckner]] error. The [[New York Giants]] and [[New England Patriots]] have played two classic Super Bowls: [[Super Bowl XLII]] which features the [[Helmet Catch]] and [[Super Bowl XLVI]], There is also a rivalry between the [[Boston Celtics]] and the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. While [[Major League Soccer]] has two teams in the New York area and one in the Boston area, the [[Hudson River Derby|rivalry]] between [[New York City FC]] and the [[New York Red Bulls]] overshadows either team's rivalry with the [[New England Revolution]].\n\n===Philadelphia===\n{{See also|Sports in Philadelphia|Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|Devils\u2013Flyers rivalry}}\nIn each of the four sports leagues, as well as Major League Soccer, there is intra-division competition between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as seen in the rivalries between the [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies]] in [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[National Football League]], and the [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers]] in the [[National Hockey League]].<ref name=NewYorkPhiladelphia>{{cite news|title=A City's Hopes Fly High on the Wings of Eagles|date=January 5, 2001|first=Peter|last=Mucha|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=A1|quote=New York teams\u2014the Mets, Rangers, Giants and Knicks\u2014rank among Philadelphia's most loathed rivals.}}</ref> There is also a rivalry between the [[National Basketball Association rivalries|New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], although it is not as intense as the other three rivalries. There is another rivalry between the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. As in the case of Boston, the rivalries between New York City FC and the New York Red Bulls with the [[Philadelphia Union]] have a lower profile than that of the two New York-area teams.\n\nIn the first season of the [[Overwatch League]] the [[Philadelphia Fusion]] was the first team to beat the previously undefeated [[New York Excelsior]] in regular season play. Excelsior was a strong team throughout the season, bringing home two of the four stage titles and entering the post-season playoffs at the highest seed. However, in a surprise upset Philadelphia knocked New York out of the playoffs and went on to come in second place in the finals as both the first and last team to defeat New York in the 2018 season.<ref>http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/24160946/overwatch-league-playoffs-philadelphia-fusion-upsets-new-york-excelsior-join-london-spitfire-overwatch-league-finals</ref>\n\nThe metropolitan area's three NHL teams tend to be primary rivals with one another, although they each have their own rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]]. Unlike baseball and football, the local teams in the New York area are in the same division and are therefore in direct competition with one another.\n\n==Olympic bids==\nNew York and [[Los Angeles]] submitted bids to the [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]] for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. The USOC voted to submit Los Angeles' bid to the [[IOC]], which was the only bid for those games.

[[New York City]] is home to the headquarters of the [[National Football League]], the [[National Hockey League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], [[National Women's Hockey League (2015\u2013)|National Women's Hockey League]], and  [[Major League Soccer]].\n\nThe [[New York metropolitan area]] is one of only two metropolitan areas (along with [[Los Angeles]]) in the United States with [[U.S. cities with teams from four major sports|more than one team]] in each of the country's four most popular major professional sports leagues, with nine such franchises. Counting these along with its two teams in Major League Soccer, the New York metropolitan area is home to a total of 11 organizations competing in the five most prestigious professional sports leagues in the United States, and have been crowned champions of their respective leagues on a combined 53 occasions.  As of 2019, five of the Metropolitan Area's nine \"Big Four\" franchises play their full schedules within the New York City limits.\n\nIn addition, Queens is host of tennis' [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. The [[New York City Marathon]] is the world's largest, and the 2004\u20132006 runnings hold the top three places in the marathons with the largest number of finishers, including 37,866 finishers in 2006.<ref>[http://www.aims-association.org/statistics/World's_Largest_Marathons.html World's Largest Marathons], [[Association of International Marathons and Distance Races]].

New York is one of four metropolitan areas to have two baseball teams (Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco being the others). The city's two current [[Major League Baseball]] teams are the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[New York Mets]]. The city also was once home to the New York Giants (now the [[San Francisco Giants]]) and the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]). There are also two [[minor league baseball]] teams in the city, the [[Staten Island Yankees]] and [[Brooklyn Cyclones]], with numerous independent minor league teams throughout the metro area.\n\n[[American football|Football]] is the city's most followed sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siena.edu/assets/files/news/Sports0316_Crosstabs.pdf|website=https://www.siena.edu/|publisher=Siena College Research Institute|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref> The city is represented in the [[National Football League]] by the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]].

The [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]] have played in New York since 1903. Known for iconic ballplayers such as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Yogi Berra]] and countless others, they play in [[Yankee Stadium]] in [[the Bronx]] and have won the [[World Series]] 27 times. The [[New York Mets]] have represented New York in the [[National League]] since 1962. The Mets play in [[Citi Field]] in [[Flushing, Queens]] and have won five NL pennants and two World Series, thus making them one of the most decorated expansion teams in Major League Baseball. The \"[[Subway Series]]\" is the name used for all regular season and World Series meetings between the two teams. Before [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997, the only instance these two teams could have played each other would have been in the World Series. The Mets and Yankees played for the [[2000 World Series|World Series in 2000]], with the Yankees winning the series 4\u20131.\n\n[[File:Citi Field, June 2 2012.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Citi Field]], home of the [[New York Mets]] in Queens]]\n\nFor many New York baseball fans, the most intense rivalry is between the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]], arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|title=Reversing the Curse|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|isbn=0-618-51748-0|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy|page=[https://archive.org/details/reversingcursein00shau/page/21 21]|title-link=Curse of the Bambino}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Red Sox vs. Yankees: The Great Rivalry|first=Harvey|last=Frommer|first2=Frederic J.|last2=Frommer|publisher=Sports Publishing, LLC|year=2004|isbn=1-58261-767-8|page=78}}</ref><ref name=UltimateRivalry>{{cite news|title=Sport's ultimate rivalry; Yanks-Red Sox epic battles go way back|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-20-yanks-sox-rivalry_x.htm|date=October 21, 2004|accessdate=January 26, 2011|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C}}</ref> When the Mets beat the Red Sox in the [[1986 World Series]], many Yankee fans attended the parade celebrating the Mets' win, saying that \"anyone who beats Boston is worth coming down for.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Ticker tape blizzard grips Gotham|date=October 29, 1986|first=Dan|last=Andrews|agency=United Press International}}</ref> Another fierce rivalry for New York baseball fans is the one between the [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nThere have been 14 Subway Series World Series match-ups between the Yankees and their [[National League]] rivals; the Mets (once), and with the two teams that departed for California in the 1950s \u2014 the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] (7 times) and [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] (6 times).\n\nNew York City is also home to two [[minor league baseball]] teams that play in the short-season Class A [[New York\u2013Penn League]]. The [[Brooklyn Cyclones]] are a Mets affiliate, and the [[Staten Island Yankees]] are affiliated with the Yankees. Two [[independent baseball league]] teams also play in the New York metropolitan area. The [[Long Island Ducks]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] have played in [[Bethpage Ballpark]] in [[Central Islip, New York|Central Islip]] since 2000. In 2011, the [[Rockland Boulders]] of the independent [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]] began play at [[Palisades Credit Union Park]] in [[Pomona, New York|Pomona]].\n\nNew York has historically had many short-lived baseball clubs including the [[New York Mutuals]], [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], [[Brooklyn Enterprise]], [[Excelsior of Brooklyn]] and [[Brooklyn Eckfords]] of the [[National Association of Baseball Players]]; the [[New York Knickerbockers]], one of the first baseball teams; the [[New York Metropolitans]] and [[Brooklyn Gladiators]] of the [[American Association (19th century)]]; the [[New York Giants (PL)]] and [[Brooklyn Ward's Wonders]] of the [[Players' League]]; the [[Brooklyn Tip-Tops]] of the [[Federal League]]; the [[Brooklyn Bushwicks]], Springfield Greys, Barton's Nighthawks, Glendale Farmers, Mount Vernon Scarlets, Union City Reds, Carlton's of the Bronx, and Bay Parkway, Bay Ridge, Cedarhurst, West New York, and Queens Club of The Metropolitan Baseball Association;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luckyshow.org/baseball/MBA.htm|title=Metropolitan Baseball Association|website=www.luckyshow.org}}</ref> and the [[New York Highlanders]] and [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]], precursors to the Yankees and Dodgers. There were also two Newark Bears teams [[Newark Bears]] and [[Newark Bears (International League)]]. [[Negro league baseball]] teams also were present in New York, including the [[Brooklyn Royal Giants]], [[Newark Stars]], [[Lincoln Giants]], [[Newark Browns]], [[New York Black Yankees]], [[New York Cubans]], and the [[Newark Eagles]].\n\nIn 1858 in [[Corona, Queens]], at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all-stars of [[Brooklyn]], including players from the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], [[Excelsior of Brooklyn]], Putnams and [[Eckford of Brooklyn]], and the All Stars of New York ([[Manhattan]]), including players from the [[New York Knickerbockers]], Gothams (predecessors of the [[San Francisco Giants]]), Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to the first all-star baseball games.<ref>The 1858 Fashion Race Course Baseball Match, Baseball Almanac, http://www.baseball-almanac.com/treasure/autont2006b.shtml Accessed August 5, 2013</ref>\n\nTwo historical clubs, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]], were among the most storied clubs in professional baseball, and were home to such players as [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Willie Mays]]. The two teams left for [[California]]\u2014the Dodgers for Los Angeles and the Giants for San Francisco\u2014in 1957. The city currently has two [[Major League Baseball]] teams, the Mets (who were formed in 1962 to replace the Dodgers and, to a lesser extent, the Giants), and the Yankees.\n\nMajor League Baseball's headquarters are located in New York City, at [[245 Park Avenue]] in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/Major_League_Baseball/cftsyi-1.html|title=Major League Baseball New York United States|publisher=Copyright \u00a9 2012, Hoover's Inc., All Rights Reserved|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Basketball===\n[[File:Britney Spears MSG.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Madison Square Garden]], home of the [[New York Knicks]] and [[New York Rangers]] in Manhattan]]\nThe first national [[basketball]] championship for major colleges, the [[National Invitation Tournament]], was held in New York in 1938, and its semifinal and final rounds remain at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The NIT has spawned a major early-season tournament known as the [[NIT Season Tip-Off]]; the semifinal and final rounds of that event are also held at the Garden.\n\nAt Madison Square Garden, New Yorkers can watch the [[New York Knicks]] play [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball. Through the 2017 [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] season, the [[New York Liberty]] also played at the Garden, but that team's main home has changed twice since then. First, the team moved to [[Westchester County Center]] in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] in 2018. Then, after the team's 2019 purchase by [[Joseph Tsai|the owner]] of the NBA's [[Brooklyn Nets]], the Liberty will move to the Nets' home of [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] from 2020 forward. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct [[American Basketball Association]] with the NBA during the 1976\u201377 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home arena ([[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two-time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward [[Julius Erving]]. During the first season of the merger (1976\u201377), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012\u201313 NBA season.\n[[File:Barclays Center western side.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Barclays Center]], home of the [[Brooklyn Nets]], [[New York Islanders]], and [[New York Liberty]] in Brooklyn]]\n\nThe Knicks have won two NBA titles (1969\u201370 and 1972\u201373).  The 1970 title was particularly memorable, as there was a question before the pivotal Game 7 in Madison Square Garden as to whether star center [[Willis Reed]] of the Knicks, who had been injured in Game 5 and missed Game 6, would be able to play.  But after both teams had already begun their pre-game shooting practice and warm-ups, Reed suddenly appeared at the court in uniform before an astonished crowd at Madison Square Garden, and when the game began, he started at center and hit the first two baskets for the Knicks, inspiring his team to a 113\u201399 victory. Reed's inspiring appearance in Game 7 is usually considered among the most dramatic sequences in NBA history and ranks third in the [[NBA 60 Greatest Playoff Moments]].   Despite the Knicks' comparative lack of championships, NBA lore has been enriched with the team's many exciting playoff battles through the years with such fierce rivals as the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe [[Long Island Nets]], an [[NBA G League]] team, started playing at the Barclays Center in 2016 before moving to [[Nassau Coliseum]] in 2017. The [[Westchester Knicks]] started in 2014 at the Westchester County Center.\n\n[[Rucker Park]] in [[Harlem]] is a celebrated court where many NBA athletes play in the summer league.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s headquarters are located in New York City, at [[Fifth Avenue]]'s [[Olympic Tower]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerej.com/33634 |title=Seherr-Thoss of FirstService Williams negotiates 153,405 s/f lease; Assisted by Jaccom, Freedman, Plehn and Plakopita |publisher=Nerej.com |accessdate=October 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114155923/http://nerej.com/33634 |archivedate=January 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Liberty]] are one of the original teams of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], which was formed in 1997.  The team's main venue moved from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center after the 2017 season, and then to Barclays Center after the 2019 season. During a massive renovation project at the arena between 2011 and 2013, the Liberty temporarily played their home games at the [[Prudential Center]] in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, the [[Newark Bears (basketball)|Newark Bears]] team played. They changed their name to the Newark Mules.\n\nThere was briefly a [[Long Island Ducks (basketball)|Long Island Ducks basketball]] team at the [[Long Island Arena]] in 1977\u20131978.\n\n[[Long Island PrimeTime]] played at [[Louis Armstrong Gymnasium]] in Flushing from 2006\u20132007. They were part of the [[United States Basketball League]].\n\n===American football===\n[[File:Meadowlands stadium parking lot.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[MetLife Stadium]], home to both the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]]]]\nSince 2010 both the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]] play in [[MetLife Stadium]] in nearby [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] near New York City. In 2014 the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. The Giants and Jets were previously located in New York City (both teams played in the Polo Grounds and Shea Stadium, and the Giants played in Yankee Stadium). Neither team plays in the city itself presently, as both teams are located in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in East Rutherford, New Jersey, playing in [[Giants Stadium]] for many years before moving to MetLife Stadium. The Giants, a keystone [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise, were founded in 1925, and exist today as one of the oldest presently active organizations in the NFL. Due to their long-spanning establishment and richer tradition of on-field success, as compared to the Jets, of the two teams, many consider the Giants to be the more popular. Founded in 1960, the originally named New York Titans, later branded as the Jets in 1963, were a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), joining the NFL as part of the AFL/NFL merger in 1970.\n\nNew York City also had many historical professional teams.  The first professional team in New York was called both the [[New York Brickley Giants|New York Giants and Brooklyn Giants]] (unrelated to the current New York Giants), and played in the predecessor to the NFL, the [[American Professional Football Association]], in 1921. In 1926, the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], [[Newark Bears (AFL)]] and [[Brooklyn Horsemen]] played in the [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]], and on the same year, the [[Brooklyn Lions]] played in the [[National Football League]] before the Horsemen and Lions merged in November and folded at season's end. The Lions' NFL franchise rights were given to the Yankees, who competed in the NFL from 1927 to 1928. When the Yankees folded, its rights were given to the existing barnstorming team [[Staten Island Stapletons]], who played in the NFL until 1932 when it stopped league play and later folded as well.\n\nIn 1930, the NFL [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] began play at Ebbets Field. The team lasted until 1944, calling themselves the Brooklyn Tigers that last season but going winless. In 1945, the team was merged with the [[Boston Yanks]] and played one more home game in Brooklyn that season as the Yanks.\n\nAnother team going by the name [[New York Yankees (1936 AFL)|New York Yankees]] played in the second AFL in 1936 and 1937. The league also had a [[Rochester Tigers|Brooklyn Tigers]] club in 1936, but the team never played in Brooklyn and folded after only seven games. A [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|third incarnation of the Yankees]] played in the third AFL in 1940 under the Yankees name, and then in 1941 as the [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)#New York Americans|New York Americans]]. Another version of the New York Yankees was a short-lived member of the [[American Association (football)|American Association]]\n\nIn 1946, the new [[All-America Football Conference]] had yet another set of [[Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] teams. These clubs lasted until 1948, after which they merged with each other.  The renamed Brooklyn-New York Yankees folded after one season when the [[AAFC\u2013NFL merger|AAFC merged with the NFL]].\n\nThe [[New York Yanks|New York Bulldogs]] were founded in 1949, sharing the [[Polo Grounds]] with the New York Giants, and then being renamed as the New York Yanks and playing in the NFL in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. In 1952, the team was relocated to Texas and renamed as the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]].\n\nIn 1974, New York briefly hosted a team known as the [[Charlotte Hornets (WFL)|New York Stars]] for the short-lived [[World Football League]], but in mid-season the team was relocated to Charlotte and became the [[Charlotte Hornets (WFL)|Charlotte Hornets]].\n\nThe short-lived [[United States Football League]] had a team in the New York area. The [[New Jersey Generals]] played at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|The Meadowlands]] from 1983 to 1985. At one point, the team was owned by future [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]]. The team folded with the rest of the league.\n\nIn 1988, the [[New York Knights (arena football)|New York Knights]] played for one season as part of the [[Arena Football League]], and then ceased operations. In 1997, the AFL added two expansion franchises, the [[Toronto Phantoms|New York CityHawks]], who played at Madison Square Garden, and the [[New Jersey Red Dogs]], who played in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. The CityHawks moved to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and were renamed the New England Sea Wolves in 1999, and then relocated to Toronto in 2001, and renamed the Toronto Phantoms. The Red Dogs were renamed the New Jersey Gladiators in 2001, then relocated and became the Las Vegas Gladiators in 2003, before relocating again and being renamed the Cleveland Gladiators. When the Sea Wolves, who were owned by the [[Madison Square Garden Company]] and had their games televised in New York City on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], relocated to Toronto, the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers relocated to Long Island and were renamed the [[New York Dragons]]. The Dragons played in New York until 2008, when the league suspended operations; no team from New York (either the city or the state) played in the league from its 2010 revival until the [[Albany Empire (AFL)|Albany Empire]], based in the state's capital, joined the AFL in 2018.\n\n[[File:Aerial view Shea Stadium with Manhattan in background 1981.jpg|thumb|Shea Stadium and vicinity, with [[Manhattan]] in the background, 1981]]\nThe Jets are sometimes regarded as \"''Long Island's Team''\" supported by the fact that until 2008, the team trained in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]] at [[Hofstra University]], and used to play at [[Shea Stadium]] (former home of the [[New York Mets]] baseball team) which is close to Nassau County.

The Guardians are New York's second XFL team, the short-lived original [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] in 2001 led to the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] playing at [[Giants Stadium]] until the league folded. The Guardians began play at MetLife Stadium in February 2020. The New York Sharks are NYC's premier professional women's tackle football team.  Established in 1999 the Sharks are the longest-running and winningest team in women's tackle football having won 3 conference titles (2002, 2003, 2004 IWFL East), 6 division titles (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 IWFL) and one championship title (2002 IWFL). The Sharks play at many fields and have no official home stadium.  The season for women's football is from April to June with playoffs and the championship game occurring from June to July. As of 2011 the Sharks are now with the WFA (Women's Football Alliance [http://wfafootball.com/]) along with the Bay Area Bandits, Boston Militia, Chicago Force, Dallas Diamonds, DC Divas, Kansas City Tribe, Pittsburgh Passion, and the San Diego Surge in an effort to bring together the best franchises of women's football.\n\nThe [[National Football League|NFL]]'s headquarters are located in New York City, at [[345 Park Avenue]] in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schefter|first=Adam |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/10spot-11week3/remembering-hit-drew-bledose-led-emergence-tom-brady |title=Remembering the hit on Drew Bledose that led to the emergence of Tom Brady |publisher=ESPN |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Ice hockey===\n[[File:NVMC 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Nassau Coliseum]] in Uniondale, was home to the [[New York Islanders]] from 1972\u20132015, and the [[New York Nets]] from 1972\u20131976.]]\n[[Ice hockey]] has a storied history and large following in the New York metropolitan area, which is unique in being the only metropolitan area and media market in the United States and Canada to feature three major league professional teams participating in the same sport. New York City is currently the full-time home to the [[New York Rangers]], playing in [[Madison Square Garden]] in Manhattan, and part-time home to the [[New York Islanders]], which currently split their home schedule between [[Barclays Center]] in Brooklyn and [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in the [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] community of [[Uniondale, New York]]. The [[New Jersey Devils]] play in [[Prudential Center]] in nearby [[Newark, New Jersey]]. All three teams are historically division rivals, having all been in the same division since the Devils moved to New Jersey from [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Denver]] in 1982. Currently, they play in the [[Metropolitan Division (NHL)|Metropolitan Division]].\n\nThe Rangers, established in 1926, are one of the [[Original Six]] \u2014 a term given to the six NHL teams in existence before the league [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled its size]] in 1967. The primary fan base for the Rangers is in the City's five boroughs, [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], much of Upstate New York, and parts of Connecticut, however they maintain a sizable following within parts of the market claimed by their two local rivals.\n\nThe Islanders, established in 1972, moved their home games to the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[2015\u201316 NHL season]] and provide their fans with an [[Islanders-Rangers rivalry|intense rivalry with the Rangers]]. The Islanders' primary fan base is in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties on [[Long Island]]. The Islanders are planning to return to Nassau County by way of a [[Belmont Park Arena|new arena]] currently scheduled to open for the 2021\u201322 season near the [[Belmont Park]] horse racing track in [[Elmont, New York]], adjacent to Queens. In the interim, the Islanders will be playing approximately half of their regular season schedule at the newly-renovated Nassau Coliseum in anticipation of the return to their traditional home jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/islanders/schedule/|title=New York Islanders 2018-19 schedule|via=NHL.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Devils, established in 1982, provide area hockey fans with yet another [[Devils-Rangers rivalry|intense rivalry]] involving the Rangers largely stemming from geographic proximity, a manifestation of a long-standing rivalry between the states of New York and New Jersey, and six playoff meetings in which the Rangers have won four. Both teams have achieved famous results for their respective fan bases in these meetings, including the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 Eastern Conference Finals]], ending in a dramatic double-overtime goal by the Rangers' [[St\u00e9phane Matteau]] during the 7th and deciding game. The Devils took a 3\u20132 series lead into Game 6 in New Jersey and jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead in the game. However, [[Mark Messier]]'s famous guarantee and [[hat-trick]] led the Rangers to victory and a seventh game. As time wound down in Game 7, the Rangers were clinging to a 1\u20130 lead when New Jersey's [[Valeri Zelepukin]] tied the game with 7.7 seconds left in regulation to silence the Garden crowd and send the game into overtime, where Matteau won it for the Rangers. Most recently, in the [[2012 Stanley Cup playoffs|2012 Eastern Conference Finals]], the Rangers would be in a very similar scenario, but would ultimately fail to overcome the 3\u20132 series deficit after trailing 2-0 and forcing overtime in Game 6 across the Hudson River at [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] on a series-winning goal only 1:03 into overtime by [[Adam Henrique]]. The Devils' primary fan base resides throughout Northern and Central New Jersey.\n\nThe Islanders and Rangers had a bitter rivalry in the 1970s and the 1980s, as the Islanders won four consecutive [[Stanley Cup]] titles; the Rangers won their most recent NHL championship in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals]], the fourth Cup victory in that team's history. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs, with the Islanders winning five of those matchups. Incidentally, as the Islanders and Devils have had little success simultaneously (the Devils\u2019 Stanley Cup success occurred in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s) throughout their respective histories and have faced off in the playoffs only once in the [[1987-88 NHL Season|1987-88 season]] in a series won by the Devils, this rivalry is perceived as an afterthought in the area particularly when compared to the Rangers\u2019 rivalries with the Islanders and Devils.\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Riveters]], established in 2015, are one of the four charter members of the [[National Women's Hockey League (2015\u2013)|National Women's Hockey League]]. They play their homes games in the [[Prudential Center|Barnabas Health Hockey House]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barnabashealthhockeyhouse.com/|title=RWJ Barnabas Health Hockey House|website=barnabashealthhockeyhouse.com|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref> at the Prudential Center in Newark beginning with the [[2016\u201317 NWHL season]]. In 2017, the Riveters announced they were partnering with the New Jersey Devils becoming the first NWHL team to officially partner with an NHL team. In 2018, the Riveters won their first [[Isobel Cup]] title.\n\nNew York City also had a historical NHL team, the [[New York Americans]] (also known as the Amerks, and in 1941\u201342, the Brooklyn Americans), who played between 1925 and 1942. They were the first hockey team to play in the city, and for most of the life of the franchise shared Madison Square Garden with the Rangers. The franchise was never a big winner, and disbanded during World War II due to financial problems and a depleted roster. The [[World Hockey Association]] team called the [[New York Raiders]] and later the [[New York Golden Blades]] played at Madison Square Garden and [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] from 1972 until 1974 when they moved to San Diego. A few historical minor league hockey teams played in the New York area in the [[Eastern Hockey League]].  The [[New York Rovers]] started as a farm team of the Rangers in 1935 playing at Madison Square Garden. They moved to the [[Long Island Arena]] in 1959 and became the [[Long Island Ducks (ice hockey)]] until 1973. The [[New York Bobcats]] are a USA Hockey-Sanctioned Tier III Junior Ice Hockey Team at Twin Rinks in Eisenhower Park from 2000 to the present. The [[New York Apple Core]] are a Tier III Junior A Ice Hockey Team in Brewster, New York.\n\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s headquarters are also located in New York City, at the [[Exxon Building (New York)|Exxon Building]] in [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/realestate/commercial/27sqft.html|title=A Frosty Headquarters for the N.H.L.|first=Claire|last=Wilson|date=July 27, 2008|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Soccer===\nProfessional soccer, as in the rest of the country, is rapidly growing in popularity in New York. The [[New York Red Bulls]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (originally known as the \"MetroStars\" until the team's purchase by Austrian corporation [[Red Bull GmbH]] in 2006) have played in the metropolitan area since the league's founding in 1996. Since 2010 they have played at [[Red Bull Arena (MLS)|Red Bull Arena]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Harrison, New Jersey]] with a capacity of just over 25,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullarena.us/arena/default.aspx |title=About Red Bull Arena |publisher=Redbullarena.us |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref> The Red Bulls have won the [[Supporters' Shield]], awarded to the MLS regular season champion, on three occasions, most recently in [[2018 Major League Soccer season|2018]].\n\nOn May 21, 2013, MLS announced that the league's 20th team would be [[New York City FC]], jointly owned by the English club [[Manchester City F.C.]] and the baseball team, the [[New York Yankees]].  They began playing in MLS in 2015 at Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx. Its eventual home stadium is yet to be determined, although team and city officials have stressed that a location within the five boroughs of New York City will be identified for the construction of a soccer-specific stadium which would be the permanent home stadium for the team.\n\nThe New York City area is also home to the [[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]] of the [[NPSL Members Cup]], whose [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|first iteration]] was arguably the most popular American soccer team ever. Playing in the original [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]], the Cosmos were known for fielding some of the world's greatest players including [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]].

The Mets, who previously played at [[Shea Stadium]], moved into the newly constructed [[Citi Field]] in 2009. Also the current [[Madison Square Garden]], atop [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], is actually the ''fourth'' separate building to use that name; the [[Madison Square Garden (1879)|first]] [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|two]] were near [[Madison Square]], hence the name, and [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|the third]] was at 50th Street and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]].\n\nThe 2000s have seen almost a complete revamping of the area's major sporting venues. This began in 2007, when the Devils moved to [[Newark, New Jersey]], and opened the [[Prudential Center]]. In 2009, both the Mets and Yankees opened new baseball stadiums adjacent to their old homes, with the Mets replacing [[Shea Stadium]] with [[Citi Field]] and the Yankees building a new [[Yankee Stadium]]. In 2010, the Jets and Giants moved to a new shared facility called New Meadowlands Stadium (now [[MetLife Stadium]]) and the Red Bulls opened their own [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Harrison, New Jersey]], called [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]] (the three had previously shared [[Giants Stadium]] in East Rutherford, New Jersey). In 2012, the Nets moved from New Jersey to the [[Barclays Center]] in Brooklyn and became the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The Islanders left Nassau County, and followed the Nets into Brooklyn in 2015.\n\nOther sports-related renovations and construction work is as follows:\n* [[Madison Square Garden]], the home of the Knicks and Rangers, underwent a massive renovation from 2010 to 2013 which finished in time for the 2013\u201314 NHL and NBA seasons. The $850 million transformation included a rebuilding of the seating bowl and concourses, new luxury suites, new LED scoreboard and ribbon boards, and two new spectator bridges that span {{convert|65|ft|m}} above the arena on each side of the playing surface.\n* On August 15, 2013, the Nassau County government announced that [[Forest City Enterprises|Forest City Ratner]] had won the bid for the renovation of the [[Nassau Coliseum]], which was vacated by the Islanders in 2015, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and the Hempstead town government.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Forest City's New York unit wins contest to redevelop Nassau Coliseum|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20130815/FREE/130819885|work=Crain's Cleveland|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Fornabaio |url=http://www.ctpost.com/sports/article/Despite-relocation-speculation-Sound-Tigers-4736469.php |title=Despite relocation speculation, Sound Tigers remain committed to Bridgeport \u2013 Connecticut Post |publisher=Ctpost.com |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref>  Ratner's proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum's [[seating capacity]] to 13,000 and an aesthetic revamp of the arena's interior and concrete facade designed by [[SHoP Architects]], the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million.

If you hear about a great lacrosse player, chances are that player has ties to Long Island.  In 2002 more than one-third (4 of 11) of the players on the [[USILA All-American Team|NCAA Division I All-American First Team]] came from Long Island high schools, with 16 Long Islanders honored overall.  In the same year, the NCAA Division II All-American list was virtually all Long Islanders and nearly every NCAA Division I, II and III lacrosse team had at least one player from the area.  In 2002 at the [[2002 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Division I championships]], three of the four men's teams were coached by a Long Islander and all four had a Long Islander as a captain.\n\nBy some accounts, lacrosse was almost as big as baseball in New York City in the first decade of the 20th century. After learning the game in New York City and moving to Long Island, Jason Stranahan started the first high school lacrosse program at [[Manhasset High School]] in 1933; football Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]] played lacrosse at Manhasset and is considered by some as the greatest lacrosse player of all time.   By the 1950s, the sport was embedded across Nassau County but had still failed to reach [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].  [[Huntington High School (New York)|Huntington High School]] fielded that county's first varsity team in 1957.

The race took place on country roads with hundreds of spectators watching cars go by at speeds close to 100 miles per hour. In 1906, several spectators were killed when a car went off the road. Vanderbilt responded quickly by building a 45-mile private highway. Races resumed in 1908, but another accident killed spectators in 1910 making organizers abandon the Long Island course for good. The Vanderbilt Cup returned in 1936 and 1937 at [[Roosevelt Raceway]] in Westbury, Long Island. The 1937 race was one of the greatest races in New York State's history, featuring the only pre-WWII appearance of the German racing team in the United States.

He organized the first polo match in the United States at Dickel's Riding Academy at 39th Street and Fifth Avenue.  In the spring of 1876, a group of polo players established the first formal American polo club, the [[Westchester Polo Club]], in New York.  On May 13, 1876, the [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] was the site of the first American outdoor polo match. The Westchester Polo Club alternated their playing seasons between New York and Rhode Island before making Newport their permanent home.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polo; The Sport of Kings |url=http://empresspolo.com/history.html |website=Empress Polo |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Meadowbrook Polo Club]] is among the most historic polo clubs in the United States with its roots dating back to 1877 when [[Thomas Hitchcock Sr.]], Oliver W. Bird, [[August Belmont]], Benjamin Nicoll, and their associates participated in the first polo match on Long Island. The polo match was played on the infield of the racetrack of the Mineola Fair Grounds.  The Meadowbrook Polo Club, originally located in [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]] and [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]] and currently located in [[Old Westbury, New York|Old Westbury]], was formally incorporated in 1881.   The Meadowbrook Polo Club's first polo field was created in 1884, leading to Long Island's role as \"Polo Capital of the World\" during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBesides Meadowbrook other polo clubs in the area include: Equueleus Polo Club, Shannon Hill Polo Club, [[Greenwich Polo Club]], Princeton University Polo, Fairfield County Hunt Club, North Fork Polo Club.

The main tournament consists of five championships: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, with additional tournaments for junior and wheelchair players.\n\nThe National Tennis Center, open to the public whenever the USTA is not holding an event, features the world's largest stadium built specifically for the sport, the 22,547-seat [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]].\n\nThe [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] began play in [[World TeamTennis]] (WTT) in 2016. Home matches were played at [[Forest Hills Stadium]] in Queens.\n\nOther teams have represented the New York City metropolitan area in WTT in the past. The [[New York Sets]], who changed their name to New York Apples in 1977, were a charter franchise of the league and played from 1974 to 1978. The Sets originally played their home matches at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] before splitting their home schedule between the Coliseum and [[Madison Square Garden]]. By the 1978 season, many home matches were played in the [[Felt Forum]] with those featuring marquee opponents played in the Garden's main arena. The franchise won the league championship in 1976 and 1977, and featured star players [[Billie Jean King]], [[Virginia Wade]], [[Sandy Mayer]] and [[Phil Dent]]. The two title-winning teams were coached by [[Fred Stolle]]. Following the 1978 season, the Apples announced they were folding. Soon afterward, WTT suspended operations, and there were no 1979 or 1980 seasons.\n\nThe [[New Jersey Stars]] joined WTT as an expansion franchise in 1987, playing their home matches in [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey]]. The team went 0\u201314 in its inaugural season but, with a completely remade roster, reached the TeamTennis Final in 1988. Home matches were moved to [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey]] in 1989, when the team was led by [[Tracy Austin]]. The signing of [[Martina Navratilova]] in 1994 produced immediate results on the court as the Stars won the league title in both 1994 and 1995. However, the team was unable to build a fan base and relocated, as two-time defending WTT champions, to become the Delaware Smash for the 1996 season.\n\nThe [[New York Hamptons]] were added as a WTT expansion franchise in 2000, playing their home matches in [[East Quogue, New York]]. They moved to [[Amagansett, New York|Amagansett]] in 2002. In 2003, Sportime NY became the team's majority owner. Home matches were moved to [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and the team's name was changed to the New York Sportimes. Led by [[Martina Hingis]], the Sportimes won the 2005 WTT title. In 2009, the Sportimes moved to New York City, playing their home matches on [[Randall's Island]]. Before the 2011 season, the Sportimes merged with the [[New York Buzz]], which had been based in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]] since 1995. Following the merger, the team played some of its home matches on Randall's Island and others in either [[Albany, New York|Albany]] or [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York. Following the 2013 season, the team was sold, and the new owner relocated it and renamed it the [[San Diego Aviators]]. Ironically, the Aviators won their first league title after relocation in New York City at Forest Hills Stadium, which was selected as the site for the 2016 WTT Final to welcome the expansion [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] to the league.\n\n=== eSports ===\nThe [[New York Excelsior]] (NYXL) is an American professional [[Overwatch (video game)#Professional competition|Overwatch esports]] team based in [[New York City, New York]].

The North East Field Hockey Association plays games at Columbia University, Hofstra University, DeWitt Clinton High School and Drew University. Teams from New York also regularly compete in indoor and outdoor tournaments around the country.\n\nNew York is considered to be the \"world capital\" of [[American handball|one-wall handball]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[New York Emperors Stickball League]] has nine stickball teams in New York City.  [[Stickball]], a street version of baseball, was popularized by youths in working-class Italian, German, and Irish neighborhoods in the 1930s.\n\n==College sports==\nAlthough the New York area is home to numerous colleges, many of which have rich athletic histories, college sports is a somewhat less visible part of the regional sports landscape.\n\nThe following [[NCAA Division I]] schools are located in the metropolitan area, as most broadly defined.

A championship win by any major sports team is considered to be worthy of the highest celebration, including a [[ticker-tape parade]] for the victorious team. In the past, ticker-tape parades have been held for the Yankees, Mets, Giants and Rangers. New Yorkers, however, tend to rally around any of the local teams who win (such as the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994 Stanley Cup champions New York Rangers]], or the [[Super Bowl XLII|2007 New York Giants]]).\n\n==Rivalries==\nDue to their geographic locations, New York has intense sports rivalries with the cities of [[Sports in Boston|Boston]] and [[Sports in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]].\n\n===Boston===\n{{See also|Sports in Boston|Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|Celtics\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nDecades before professional baseball became popular, New York and Boston claimed distinctive versions of [[bat-and-ball games]]. A variant of baseball known as [[The Massachusetts Game]] was played in New England in the 1850s, while New York teams played by the [[Knickerbocker Rules]] set up by [[Alexander Cartwright]]. The New York rules eventually became the basis for the modern sport of baseball.\n\nTeams in Boston and New York offer some of the best rivalries in their respective sports, none are more famous, however, then the longtime feud between the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. The viciousness and fierceness of the rivalry has led to the New York\u2013Boston rivalry being evident between the [[Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|New York Jets and the New England Patriots]] in the [[National Football League]] and the [[National Basketball Association rivalries|New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics]] in the [[National Basketball Association]].<ref name=NewYorkBoston>{{cite news|title=Baseball's Fault Lines Show Stress In Arizona|date=February 2, 2008|first=Dan|last=Steinberg|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=E11|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/01/AR2008020103259_pf.html}}</ref> The [[New York Rangers]] have been longtime rivals with the [[Boston Bruins]] also due to the fact that both teams are members of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Original Six]] franchises, but this has been eclipsed by the [[Metropolitan Division]] rivalries in recent years.\n\nThe rivalry has also spread to other teams not in the same league, The [[1986 World Series]] between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] is considered a classic especially the 6th game and the famous [[Bill Buckner]] error. The [[New York Giants]] and [[New England Patriots]] have played two classic Super Bowls: [[Super Bowl XLII]] which features the [[Helmet Catch]] and [[Super Bowl XLVI]], There is also a rivalry between the [[Boston Celtics]] and the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. While [[Major League Soccer]] has two teams in the New York area and one in the Boston area, the [[Hudson River Derby|rivalry]] between [[New York City FC]] and the [[New York Red Bulls]] overshadows either team's rivalry with the [[New England Revolution]].\n\n===Philadelphia===\n{{See also|Sports in Philadelphia|Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|Devils\u2013Flyers rivalry}}\nIn each of the four sports leagues, as well as Major League Soccer, there is intra-division competition between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as seen in the rivalries between the [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies]] in [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[National Football League]], and the [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry|New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers]] in the [[National Hockey League]].<ref name=NewYorkPhiladelphia>{{cite news|title=A City's Hopes Fly High on the Wings of Eagles|date=January 5, 2001|first=Peter|last=Mucha|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=A1|quote=New York teams\u2014the Mets, Rangers, Giants and Knicks\u2014rank among Philadelphia's most loathed rivals.}}</ref> There is also a rivalry between the [[National Basketball Association rivalries|New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], although it is not as intense as the other three rivalries. There is another rivalry between the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. As in the case of Boston, the rivalries between New York City FC and the New York Red Bulls with the [[Philadelphia Union]] have a lower profile than that of the two New York-area teams.\n\nIn the first season of the [[Overwatch League]] the [[Philadelphia Fusion]] was the first team to beat the previously undefeated [[New York Excelsior]] in regular season play. Excelsior was a strong team throughout the season, bringing home two of the four stage titles and entering the post-season playoffs at the highest seed. However, in a surprise upset Philadelphia knocked New York out of the playoffs and went on to come in second place in the finals as both the first and last team to defeat New York in the 2018 season.<ref>http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/24160946/overwatch-league-playoffs-philadelphia-fusion-upsets-new-york-excelsior-join-london-spitfire-overwatch-league-finals</ref>\n\nThe metropolitan area's three NHL teams tend to be primary rivals with one another, although they each have their own rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]]. Unlike baseball and football, the local teams in the New York area are in the same division and are therefore in direct competition with one another.\n\n==Olympic bids==\nNew York and [[Los Angeles]] submitted bids to the [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]] for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. The USOC voted to submit Los Angeles' bid to the [[IOC]], which was the only bid for those games.
