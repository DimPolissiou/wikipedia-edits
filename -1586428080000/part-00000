While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences. The bold new kimono designs were a middle ground that combined aspects from both.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=162}} With the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] in the 1930s, male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, [[bomber]]s and tanks.<ref name=\"Atkins\">{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=Jacqueline M.|title=Omoshirogara Textile Design and Children's Clothing in Japan 1910\u20131930|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings.

These inhabit a spectrum from geometric block patterns to floral patterns, with some having floral motifs repeating within a striped or other pattern. These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s. One fashion trend of the 1930s, represented in the collection, was for black kimono with abstract patterns in red, yellow, cream and white.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nThe semi-formal, colourfully-decorated {{lang|ja-Latn|h\u014dmongi}} style is represented in the collection,{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=170\u2013171}} as is a formal, black style with decoration limited to below the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=173}} The collection also has examples of modernist kimono whose decoration celebrates modern forms of transport including [[ocean liners]].

While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences. The bold new kimono designs were a middle ground that combined aspects from both.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=162}} With the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] in the 1930s, male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, [[bomber]]s and tanks.<ref name=\"Atkins\">{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=Jacqueline M.|title=Omoshirogara Textile Design and Children's Clothing in Japan 1910\u20131930|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings.

These inhabit a spectrum from geometric block patterns to floral patterns, with some having floral motifs repeating within a striped or other pattern. These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s.
