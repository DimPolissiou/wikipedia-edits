Ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of Theropoda by the early Jurassic, however, the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the Late Jurassic. According to the majority of the latest research, Ceratosauria includes the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', and ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', found primarily (though not exclusively) in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic [[Coelophysoidea]] and [[Dilophosauridae]], implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a [[clade|natural group]] with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carrano|first=Matthew T.|last2=Sampson|first2=Scott D.|date=2008-01-01|title=The Phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=183\u2013236|doi=10.1017/S1477201907002246|issn=1477-2019|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97ba4ba82753286ee9a105aeec4d97ec2d5fc585}}</ref>\n\nCeratosauria derives its names from the type species, ''[[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus nasicornis]]'', described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, ''Ceratosaurus nasicornis'', was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" />  Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurs]], whereas more basal species such as ''C. nasicornis'' appear more similar to other basal [[Theropoda|theropods]]. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record, means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\n\n=== Historical Phylogeny ===\nCeratosauria was first described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of ''C. nasicornis'' and those of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. Since ''C. nasicornis'' was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near ''Archaeopteryx'' and its related groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=O. C.|title=On the united metatarsal bones of Ceratosaurus.|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=s3-28|issue=164|pages=161\u2013162|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-28.164.161|year=1884|bibcode=1884AmJS...28..161M|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1450068}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the idea of the Ceratosauria was soon contested by Marsh's rival, [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. Cope argued that the taxon was invalid.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Dinosauria|last=...).|first=Weishampel, David B. (1952-|last2=Peter|first2=Dodson|last3=...).|first3=Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka, (1930-|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520242098|oclc=493366196}}</ref>  The idea of the Ceratosauria would regain some support more than thirty years later when Gilmore argued in its favor in 1920. Despite Gilmore's support, few species were added to the group following World War I, and little emphasis was placed on it. In fact, the scientific communities most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of [[Alfred Romer|Romer]], [[Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent|Lapparent]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lavocat|Lavocat]], [[Edwin H. Colbert|Colbert]], and [[Alan J. Charig|Charig]] amongst others.\n\nCeratosauria's fortune changed in 1986 when [[Jacques Gauthier]], in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or [[Tetanurae]]. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and [[Coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds|url=http://biostor.org/reference/110202|journal=Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=8|issn=0885-4629}}</ref>  Gauthier's paper brought Ceratosauria's use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]] had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids.\n\n=== Current Phylogeny ===\nMost paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior the middle Jurassic, and even in the middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]]. Several recent discoveries of possible ceratosaurs have begun reshaping the phylogeny of Ceratosauria by filling in some of these gaps. Specifically, this has allowed paleontologists to begin altering the sub-groups inside Ceratosauria, in an attempt to find their most basal members.\n\nCurrently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria divides into two sub groups, [[Ceratosauridae]] and [[Abelisaur]]oidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polotomy.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

Recently, Rauhut and Carrano have placed Elaphrosaurinae inside Noasauridae while simultaneously moving the previous noasaurs into Noasaurinae.<ref name=\":2\" />  Into their new Noasauridae, they have uniquely included ''[[Deltadromeus]]'' and ''[[Limusaurus]]''.\n\nThe oldest known ceratosaur currently described is ''[[Berberosaurus|Berberosaurus liassicus]]'' at 185 Ma. Some paleontologists believe that ''Berberosaurus'' ''liassicus'', is the most basal ceratosaur currently discovered as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allain|first=Ronan|last2=Tykoski|first2=Ronald|last3=Aquesbi|first3=Najat|last4=Jalil|first4=Nour-Eddine|last5=Monbaron|first5=Michel|last6=Russell|first6=Dale|last7=Taquet|first7=Philippe|date=2007-09-12|title=An abelisauroid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Jurassic of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and the radiation of ceratosaurs|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=610\u2013624|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[610:AADTFT]2.0.CO;2|issn=0272-4634|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/8145/files/monbaron_adt.pdf}}</ref>  The placement of ''B''.

Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astralagus and calcaneum.<ref name=\":1\" />  For less derived members of the group, such as ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of ''C. nasicornis'' was rather similar to the basal [[Theropoda|theropod]] mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary ''[[Allosaurus]]''. ''C. nasicornis'' had larger teeth than ''Allosaurus'', and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey. Abelisaurids, however, carried many of these defining traits to their extremes. Most abelisaurids had largely shortened forelimbs, with ''Carnotaurus'' having shrunk them further than any large theropod.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=Jos\u00e9|last2=Novas|first2=Fernando|last3=Coria|first3=Rodolfo|date=1990|title=Carnotaurus sastrei Bonaparte, the horned, lightly built carnosaur from the Middle Cretaceous of Patagonia.

Ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of Theropoda by the early Jurassic, however, the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the Late Jurassic. According to the majority of the latest research, Ceratosauria includes the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', and ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', found primarily (though not exclusively) in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic [[Coelophysoidea]] and [[Dilophosauridae]], implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a [[clade|natural group]] with other ceratosaurs, and are excluded from this group.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Carrano|first=Matthew T.|last2=Sampson|first2=Scott D.|date=2008-01-01|title=The Phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda)|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=183\u2013236|doi=10.1017/S1477201907002246|issn=1477-2019|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97ba4ba82753286ee9a105aeec4d97ec2d5fc585}}</ref>\n\nCeratosauria derives its names from the type species, ''[[Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus nasicornis]]'', described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in 1884. A moderately large predator from the Late Jurassic, ''Ceratosaurus nasicornis'', was the first ceratosaur to be discovered. Ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size, with some exceptions like the larger ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and the significantly smaller noasaurs. The major defining characteristics of Ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" />  Both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group, such as the [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurs]], whereas more basal species such as ''C. nasicornis'' appear more similar to other basal [[Theropoda|theropods]]. The highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record, means that the characteristics, relationships, and early history of Ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated.\n\n== Phylogeny ==\n\n=== Historical Phylogeny ===\nCeratosauria was first described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' in 1884. Writing about the newly discovered ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', he noted the similarities between the firmly united metatarsals of ''C. nasicornis'' and those of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. Since ''C. nasicornis'' was the only other dinosaur discovered at the time to share this trait, Marsh concluded that Ceratosauria must be placed very near ''Archaeopteryx'' and its related groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=O. C.|title=On the united metatarsal bones of Ceratosaurus.|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=s3-28|issue=164|pages=161\u2013162|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-28.164.161|year=1884|bibcode=1884AmJS...28..161M|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1450068}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the idea of the Ceratosauria was soon contested by Marsh's rival, [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. Cope argued that the taxon was invalid.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Dinosauria|last=...).|first=Weishampel, David B. (1952-|last2=Peter|first2=Dodson|last3=...).|first3=Osm\u00f3lska, Halszka, (1930-|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520242098|oclc=493366196}}</ref>  The idea of the Ceratosauria would regain some support more than thirty years later when Gilmore argued in its favor in 1920. Despite Gilmore's support, few species were added to the group following World War I, and little emphasis was placed on it. In fact, the scientific communities most common interaction with Ceratosauria throughout much of the 20th century was the disputation of its existence, performed by the likes of [[Alfred Romer|Romer]], [[Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent|Lapparent]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lavocat|Lavocat]], [[Edwin H. Colbert|Colbert]], and [[Alan J. Charig|Charig]] amongst others.\n\nCeratosauria's fortune changed in 1986 when [[Jacques Gauthier]], in an attempt to clarify the evolution of birds, grouped the majority of theropods into either Ceratosauria or [[Tetanurae]]. In Ceratosauria, he placed the ceratosaurs and [[Coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds|url=http://biostor.org/reference/110202|journal=Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=8|issn=0885-4629}}</ref>  Gauthier's paper brought Ceratosauria's use back in vogue, and by the early 1990s, [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]] had also been included under Ceratosauria. The triumvirate model of ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and abelisaurids would go unchallenged until the early 2000s. Beginning at the turn of the millennium, a large number of paleontologists began excluding coelophysoids from Ceratosauria. This view is now widely held thanks to several similarities between Ceratosauria and Tetanurae not found in coelophysoids.\n\n=== Current Phylogeny ===\nMost paleontologists have postulated that Ceratosauria split off from other theropods in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. Despite this, no ceratosaurs have been discovered prior the middle Jurassic, and even in the middle Jurassic, species are sparse. Many scientists, such as Carrano and Sampson, have postulated the lack of specimens is due to a poor fossil record, rather than an indictment on the abundance of ceratosaurs at the time. A similarly large gap of specimens exist in the lower Cretaceous, particularly for [[Abelisauridae|Abelisaridae]]. Several recent discoveries of possible ceratosaurs have begun reshaping the phylogeny of Ceratosauria by filling in some of these gaps. Specifically, this has allowed paleontologists to begin altering the sub-groups inside Ceratosauria, in an attempt to find their most basal members.\n\nCurrently, most paleontologists agree that Ceratosauria divides into two sub groups, [[Ceratosauridae]] and [[Abelisaur]]oidea, with some variance as to which taxa are placed into basal polotomy.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=Oliver W.

Recently, Rauhut and Carrano have placed Elaphrosaurinae inside Noasauridae while simultaneously moving the previous noasaurs into Noasaurinae.<ref name=\":2\" />  Into their new Noasauridae, they have uniquely included ''[[Deltadromeus]]'' and ''[[Limusaurus]]''.\n\nThe oldest known ceratosaur currently described is ''[[Berberosaurus|Berberosaurus liassicus]]'' at 185 Ma. Some paleontologists believe that ''Berberosaurus'' ''liassicus'', is the most basal ceratosaur currently discovered as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allain|first=Ronan|last2=Tykoski|first2=Ronald|last3=Aquesbi|first3=Najat|last4=Jalil|first4=Nour-Eddine|last5=Monbaron|first5=Michel|last6=Russell|first6=Dale|last7=Taquet|first7=Philippe|date=2007-09-12|title=An abelisauroid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Jurassic of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and the radiation of ceratosaurs|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=610\u2013624|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[610:AADTFT]2.0.CO;2|issn=0272-4634|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/8145/files/monbaron_adt.pdf}}</ref>  The placement of ''B''.

Likewise, ceratosaurs fused their ilium, ischium, and pubis together, as well as the astralagus and calcaneum.<ref name=\":1\" />  For less derived members of the group, such as ''[[Ceratosaurus|C. nasicornis]]'', traits such as raising of the skull and shortening of the forelimbs were not as noticeable. The skull of ''C. nasicornis'' was rather similar to the basal [[Theropoda|theropod]] mold, with a distinguishing nasal crest to go along with lacrimal crests similar to the contemporary ''[[Allosaurus]]''. ''C. nasicornis'' had larger teeth than ''Allosaurus'', and some paleontologists postulate that it would have had a difficult time attacking larger prey. Abelisaurids, however, carried many of these defining traits to their extremes. Most abelisaurids had largely shortened forelimbs, with ''Carnotaurus'' having shrunk them further than any large theropod.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=Jos\u00e9|last2=Novas|first2=Fernando|last3=Coria|first3=Rodolfo|date=1990|title=Carnotaurus sastrei Bonaparte, the horned, lightly built carnosaur from the Middle Cretaceous of Patagonia.

Some joint variation has also been observed in Ceratosauria, and it has been postulated that they may have had better shoulder mobility than other large theropods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Geography ===\nCeratosaurs appeared to have had a global population that diverged by the early Jurassic. However, they appear to have largely disappeared from [[Laurasia]] in the [[Cretaceous]], with those few specimens that have been discovered having been possibly reintroduced from [[Gondwana]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tortosa|first=Thierry|last2=Buffetaut|first2=Eric|last3=Vialle|first3=Nicolas|last4=Dutour|first4=Yves|last5=Turini|first5=Eric|last6=Cheylan|first6=Gilles|title=A new abelisaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of southern France: Palaeobiogeographical implications|journal=Annales de Pal\u00e9ontologie|volume=100|issue=1|pages=63\u201386|doi=10.1016/j.annpal.2013.10.003|year=2014}}</ref> No confirmed specimens of ceratosaurs in North America during the Cretaceous have been found.\n\n[[Abelisauridae|Abelisaurids]] in particular had great success in [[Gondwana]], particularly in the Cretaceous. Some Gondwana specimens have recently been found and dated to Late Jurassic, and possibly even the Middle Jurassic, greatly extending the Abelisaurid timeline. Some paleontologists have postulated that a large desert may have kept abelisaurids locked in southern Gondwana until the late Jurassic.<ref name=\"Eoabelisaurus\" />   Whether correlation or causation, it has been largely observed that late Cretaceous ceratosaurs were found less in areas dominated by basal [[Tetanurae|tetanurans]] (Africa) or [[Coelurosauria|coelosaurs]] (North America and Asia).

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire and worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The gaps created in the obstacles permitted the assault to hit the beach.  With the invasion force waiting, Seabees placed pontoon causeways over which the assault could access the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion was back in England concluding Atlantic operations.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.

During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.

Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .

After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire and worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The gaps created in the obstacles permitted the assault to hit the beach.  With the invasion force waiting, Seabees placed pontoon causeways over which the assault could access the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.

By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942.

Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job.

During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.

The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.

Travertine often has a fibrous or [[concentric]] appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and even rusty varieties. It is formed by a process of rapid precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]], often at the mouth of a hot spring or in a limestone cave. In the latter, it can form [[stalactites]], [[stalagmite]]s, and other [[speleothems]].

It is sometimes known as travertine limestone or travertine marble; these are the same stone, although travertine is classified properly as a type of limestone, not [[marble]]. The stone is characterised by pitted holes and troughs in its surface.  Although these troughs occur naturally, they suggest signs of considerable wear and tear over time. It can also be polished to a smooth, shiny finish, and comes in a variety of colors from grey to coral-red. Travertine is most commonly available in [[tile]] sizes for floor installations.\n\n[https://stone-pavers.com.au/travertine-tiles/ Travertine] is one of the most frequently used stones in [[modern architecture]].

It is sometimes known as travertine limestone or travertine marble; these are the same stone, although travertine is classified properly as a type of limestone, not [[marble]]. The stone is characterised by pitted holes and troughs in its surface.  Although these troughs occur naturally, they suggest signs of considerable wear and tear over time. It can also be polished to a smooth, shiny finish, and comes in a variety of colors from grey to coral-red. Travertine is most commonly available in [[tile]] sizes for floor installations.\n\nTravertine is one of the most frequently used stones in [[modern architecture]]. It is commonly used for fa\u00e7ades, wall [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], and flooring. The lobby walls of the [[modernist]] [[Willis Tower]] (1970) (formerly Sears Tower) in [[Chicago]] are made of travertine.<ref>[http://www.willistower.com/interior_exterior.html \"The Willis Tower\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126133657/http://www.willistower.com/interior_exterior.html |date=2009-11-26 }}, Official Website</ref>  Architect [[Welton Becket]] frequently incorporated travertine into many of his projects. The first floor of the Becket-designed [[UCLA Medical Center]] has thick travertine walls.

It first aired in France on September 4, 1996 during a block called ''La Plan\u00e8te de Donkey Kong'' translated as ''The Planet of Donkey Kong'', and aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada in 1997. In the United States, it was one of the first series to be shown on [[Television networks preceding Freeform|Fox Family]], in which the series was broadcast in its entirety from August 15, 1998 (the same day Fox Family was launched) until 2000. It was also seen on [[Fox Kids]] from 1998-1999 for a very short time airing two episodes as specials on December 19 of 1998 and aired a few more episodes during the summer of 1999 before being taken off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kidsblockblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/fox-kids-saturday-morning-lineups-1998-1999/ |title=Fox Kids Saturday Morning Lineups (1998-1999) The Kids Block Blog |publisher=wordpress.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, ''Donkey Kong Country'' took over the [[TV Tokyo]] 6:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot from ''[[Gokudo the Adventurer|Gokudo]]'' airing on October 1, 1999, and was later replaced with ''[[Hamtaro]]'' after ending on June 30, 2000.\n\n''Donkey Kong Country'' was one of the earliest television series' to be entirely animated with [[motion capture]] technology. Several elements of the series, such as the Crystal Coconut, appeared in later ''Donkey Kong'' video games like ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', which was released a year after the show began airing on Fox.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] is an ape who happens to find a magic coconut called the Crystal Coconut, which grants wishes and is capable of answering questions asked of it. Donkey Kong is the protector of the Crystal Coconut, which is housed in [[Cranky Kong]]'s Cabin. [[King K. Rool]] and his minions want to steal the Crystal Coconut from Donkey Kong and company in order to rule Kongo Bongo Island, the setting of the show. Try as they may, King K. Rool and his minions never succeed in stealing the Crystal Coconut. Each episode features two songs performed by the show's characters, and the series spanned a total of 40 episodes in two seasons.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main from the games===\nThese characters all came from ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (mostly the former). However, some of them went through some design changes.\n\n* '''[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]''' - The show's titular character, and the future ruler of Kongo Bongo Island, voiced by [[Richard Yearwood]]. His catchphrase is \"Banana slamma!\" His singing voice was provided by [[Sterling Jarvis]].\n* '''[[Diddy Kong]]''' - DK's sidekick and buddy, voiced by [[Andrew Sabiston]], who had earlier voiced [[Yoshi]] in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|''Super Mario World'']].\n* '''[[Cranky Kong]]''' - DK and Diddy's mentor, who often mixes potions. He is able to use the Crystal Coconut to show up as a hologram whenever he needs to alert DK. The show makes no mention of how he and DK are related or of his days in the arcade games, which he frequently mentions in the game series as a form of [[meta-reference]]. He is voiced by [[Aron Tager]].\n* '''[[Funky Kong]]''' - The resident airport manager. He looks as he did in the first game but has tan fur instead of brown. He is voiced by [[Damon D'Oliveira]].\n* '''[[Candy Kong]]''' - DK's girlfriend. She is much less passive than in the games, and even has a different design to match. Part of her design for the show was mixed with her old game design for ''Donkey Kong 64''. She is voiced by [[Joy Tanner]].\n* '''[[Dixie Kong]]''' - Diddy's girlfriend, and the only character on the show who originated in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2]]''. Like Candy, her design differs a bit (but not as much), and she also has been given tan fur like Funky. Ironically, while Candy is less passive than in the games, Dixie isn't quite as dynamic, as she is not given much attention. She also has a habit of losing her pets. She is voiced by [[Louise Vallance]].\n* '''[[King K. Rool]]''' - The main villain of the series, always attempting to steal the Crystal Coconut and take over the island. His only noticeable changes in physical appearance is that his cape is much shorter, and his left eye is not bloodshot, although it does enlarge often. He is voiced by [[Benedict Campbell]] and in the pilot episode by [[Len Carlson]], who had earlier voiced [[Ganon]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Krusha]]''' - K. Rool's bodyguard. He is very childish and enjoys watching the ''Sing Along with Uncle Swampy Show''. He is voiced by [[Len Carlson]].\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Klump]]''' - K. Rool's general. He often carries out his boss's plans, but without success. He was voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Kritters]]''' - K. Rool's standard foot soldiers. They look as they did in the first game but are also armed with Klap-Blasters.\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Klaptraps]]''' - Small crocodiles who like to eat wooden surfaces in the manner of [[termites]]. They are fired out of Klap-Blasters by the Kritters and usually give comments on whatever they're eating.\n\n===Exclusives to the show===\nThese characters appeared only in the show and have not appeared in any games to date.\n\n* '''Bluster Kong''' - The boss of the Bluster Barrelworks factory, where barrels are produced. He has a huge ego and constantly hits on Candy, his lone employee, unsuccessfully. He is voiced by Donald Burda.\n* '''Kaptain Skurvy''' - A secondary, pirate-themed villain for the series. His design is identical that of [[Kremling Krew|Kannon]] from the second ''Country'' game, and it has even been revealed that he is Klump's long lost twin brother. He persists in chasing the Crystal Coconut, claiming it to be the birthright of one of his ancestors. He is voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n* '''[[List of Donkey Kong characters#Klaptrap|Junior the Klaptrap]]''' - As his name suggests, he is an abnormally large Klaptrap (about Diddy's size). He is voiced by Ron Rubin.\n* '''Kutlass & Green Kroc''' - Skurvy's minions, the former of whom shares a name with [[Kremling Krew|one of the enemies]] from the second game.\n* '''Polly Roger the Parrot''' - The pet parrot of Kaptain Skurvy, Polly Roger later works for K. Rool. He and Klump do not get along well.\n* '''Baby Kong''' - First appeared on the show as DK after having drunk a youth potion. Confusingly, he appeared again as a separate character from DK in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', similar to how [[Baby Mario]] showed up as a different character from [[Mario]] in his sports games.\n* '''Robot Candy Clone''' - A robot look-alike of Candy created by K. Rool to lure DK into certain traps.\n* '''Kong Fu''' - A martial arts \"Kung Fu Master\" who is hired by K. Rool to defeat Donkey Kong in the Annual Donkey Kong Challenge. He only appears in one episode with the same name. His name was later used in the French version of [[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]] for the boss Karate Kong.\n* '''Eddie the Mean Old Yeti''' - A white-furred [[yeti]] who lives alone in the White Mountains. He doesn't seem to like it when other characters intrude on his territory.\n* '''Inka Dinka Doo''' - The temple god from where the Crystal Coconut came. It was he who selected DK to be the future ruler. He appears as a stone column on which expressions are featured. This stone block turns around to show the expression that matches his current mood.\n* '''Metal Head''' - Donkey Kong after exchanging minds with Bluster's robot.\n\n==Voice cast==\nSeason 1 of the French version was done in Quebec, with the exception of Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong<ref>http://www.rsdoublage.com/comedien-512-Herve-Grull.html</ref> and Funky Kong's voice actors who are from France. Season 2 was not given a French version until later when it got released on DVD years afterwards, which had a new voice cast and it was done in France, with DK and Funky's voice actors reprising their character roles. Herv\u00e9 Grull did not return as Diddy Kong as he had long since hit puberty and was replaced by an adult woman as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planete-jeunesse.com/fiche-1679-donkey-kong.html |title= Plan\u00e8te Jeunesse - Donkey Kong |publisher=planete-jeunesse.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character Role\n!{{flagicon|Quebec}} French (Season 1)\n!{{flagicon|France}} French (Season 2)\n!{{flagicon|Canada}} English\n!{{flagicon|Japan}} Japanese\n|-\n|Donkey Kong \n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|Franck Capillery\n|[[Richard Yearwood]]\n|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]\n|-\n|Diddy Kong\n|Herv\u00e9 Grull\n|Lucile Boulanger\n|[[Andrew Sabiston]]\n|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n|-\n|Cranky Kong\n|Yves Massicotte\n|Yves Barsacq\n|[[Aron Tager|Aaron Tager]]\n|[[Ryusei Nakao]]\n|-\n|Funky Kong\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|Emmanuel Curtil\n|[[Damon D'Oliveira]]\n|Banana Ice\n|-\n|Candy Kong\n|Camille Cyr-Desmarais\n|Odile Schmitt\n|[[Joy Tanner]]\n|[[Mika Kanai]]\n|-\n|Dixie Kong\n|Unknown\n|Annie Barclay\n|[[Louise Vallance]]\n|[[Becky (television personality)|Becky]]\n|-\n|Bluster Kong\n|Daniel Lesourd\n|Patrice Dozier\n|Donald Burda\n|[[Daiki Nakamura]]\n|-\n|King K.

However, these episodes are not in chronological order, as a flashback shown in the third episode actually occurs in the fourth episode of the tape. It was released in Canada around 1997 with distribution handled by [[Seville Pictures]] and [[Nelvana]] themselves as the secondary distributor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhscollector.com/movie/donkey-kong-country-legend-crystal-coconut |title=Donkey Kong Country: The Legend Of The Crystal Coconut - Your VHS Collector |publisher=vhscollector.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-12}}</ref> The United States version of the tape was distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Video]] and was released in the nation on November 9, 1999, marking this the only time that the U.S. had a VHS release of this series.\n\nIn Japan, the TV series was very popular and proven to be successful, since the videogames that the series is based on, was also a hit. It was also because the Japanese [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] version of the series was produced with a very high budget thus investing to having a big-name well known voice cast. The Japanese dubbed version of the entire series has been released on home video through Rental VHS tapes in 2000. [[Shogakukan|Shogakukan Video]] has released all the episodes of the series spreading through 13 volumes and they were sold by [[Nippon Columbia]], a record label company. Each tape contains three episodes each and in consistent order of its Japanese broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]], with the exception of its series finale, ''Message in a Bottle Show'' was not included due to mostly being a clip episode. However, that episode was later introduced as part of another TV Tokyo program which is a quiz show known as ''Ohashi.''\n\nIn the PAL regions, ''Donkey Kong Country Vol.1'' (released in Australia) and ''Donkey Kong Country - Bad Hair Day'' (released in the United Kingdom) were released on DVD. The other two DVDs, ''Donkey Kong Country: Hooray for Holly Kongo Bongo'' and ''Donkey Kong Country: The Kongo Bongo Festival of Lights'' (both released in Australia) only held one episode. After over three years of no new English DVD, ''I Spy With My Hairy Eye'' was released in the UK in 2008.\n\nFinally in 2013, [[Phase 4 Films]], a small Canadian low-budget film company, officially purchased the rights to license and distribute the series for a DVD release in Region 1 alongside with [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]  and began releasing episodes starting off with the ''He Came, He Saw, He Kong-quered'' DVD that was released on August 20, 2013.

It first aired in France on September 4, 1996 during a block called ''La Plan\u00e8te de Donkey Kong'' translated as ''The Planet of Donkey Kong'', and aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada in 1997. In the United States, it was one of the first series to be shown on [[Television networks preceding Freeform|Fox Family]], in which the series was broadcast in its entirety from August 15, 1998 (the same day Fox Family was launched) until 2000. It was also seen on [[Fox Kids]] from 1998-1999 for a very short time airing two episodes as specials on December 19 of 1998 and aired a few more episodes during the summer of 1999 before being taken off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kidsblockblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/fox-kids-saturday-morning-lineups-1998-1999/ |title=Fox Kids Saturday Morning Lineups (1998-1999) The Kids Block Blog |publisher=wordpress.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, ''Donkey Kong Country'' took over the [[TV Tokyo]] 6:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot from ''[[Gokudo the Adventurer|Gokudo]]'' airing on October 1, 1999, and was later replaced with ''[[Hamtaro]]'' after ending on June 30, 2000.\n\n''Donkey Kong Country'' was one of the earliest television series' to be entirely animated with [[motion capture]] technology. Several elements of the series, such as the Crystal Coconut, appeared in later ''Donkey Kong'' video games like ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', which was released a year after the show began airing on Fox.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] is an ape who happens to find a magic coconut called the Crystal Coconut, which grants wishes and is capable of answering questions asked of it. Donkey Kong is the protector of the Crystal Coconut, which is housed in [[Cranky Kong]]'s Cabin. [[King K. Rool]] and his minions want to steal the Crystal Coconut from Donkey Kong and company in order to rule Kongo Bongo Island, the setting of the show. Try as they may, King K. Rool and his minions never succeed in stealing the Crystal Coconut. Each episode features two songs performed by the show's characters, and the series spanned a total of 40 episodes in two seasons.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main from the games===\nThese characters all came from ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (mostly the former). However, some of them went through some design changes.\n\n* '''[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]]''' - The show's titular character, and the future ruler of Kongo Bongo Island, voiced by [[Richard Yearwood]]. His catchphrase is \"Banana slamma!\" His singing voice was provided by [[Sterling Jarvis]].\n* '''[[Diddy Kong]]''' - DK's sidekick and buddy, voiced by [[Andrew Sabiston]], who had earlier voiced [[Yoshi]] in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|''Super Mario World'']].\n* '''[[Cranky Kong]]''' - DK and Diddy's mentor, who often mixes potions. He is able to use the Crystal Coconut to show up as a hologram whenever he needs to alert DK. The show makes no mention of how he and DK are related or of his days in the arcade games, which he frequently mentions in the game series as a form of [[meta-reference]]. He is voiced by [[Aron Tager]].\n* '''[[Funky Kong]]''' - The resident airport manager. He looks as he did in the first game but has tan fur instead of brown. He is voiced by [[Damon D'Oliveira]].\n* '''[[Candy Kong]]''' - DK's girlfriend. She is much less passive than in the games, and even has a different design to match. Part of her design for the show was mixed with her old game design for ''Donkey Kong 64''. She is voiced by [[Joy Tanner]].\n* '''[[Dixie Kong]]''' - Diddy's girlfriend, and the only character on the show who originated in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2]]''. Like Candy, her design differs a bit (but not as much), and she also has been given tan fur like Funky. Ironically, while Candy is less passive than in the games, Dixie isn't quite as dynamic, as she is not given much attention. She also has a habit of losing her pets. She is voiced by [[Louise Vallance]].\n* '''[[King K. Rool]]''' - The main villain of the series, always attempting to steal the Crystal Coconut and take over the island. His only noticeable changes in physical appearance is that his cape is much shorter, and his left eye is not bloodshot, although it does enlarge often. He is voiced by [[Benedict Campbell]] and in the pilot episode by [[Len Carlson]], who had earlier voiced [[Ganon]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Krusha]]''' - K. Rool's bodyguard. He is very childish and enjoys watching the ''Sing Along with Uncle Swampy Show''. He is voiced by [[Len Carlson]].\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Klump]]''' - K. Rool's general. He often carries out his boss's plans, but without success. He was voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Kritters]]''' - K. Rool's standard foot soldiers. They look as they did in the first game but are also armed with Klap-Blasters.\n* '''[[Kremling Krew|Klaptraps]]''' - Small crocodiles who like to eat wooden surfaces in the manner of [[termites]]. They are fired out of Klap-Blasters by the Kritters and usually give comments on whatever they're eating.\n\n===Exclusives to the show===\nThese characters appeared only in the show and have not appeared in any games to date.\n\n* '''Bluster Kong''' - The boss of the Bluster Barrelworks factory, where barrels are produced. He has a huge ego and constantly hits on Candy, his lone employee, unsuccessfully. He is voiced by Donald Burda.\n* '''Kaptain Skurvy''' - A secondary, pirate-themed villain for the series. His design is identical that of [[Kremling Krew|Kannon]] from the second ''Country'' game, and it has even been revealed that he is Klump's long lost twin brother. He persists in chasing the Crystal Coconut, claiming it to be the birthright of one of his ancestors. He is voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n* '''[[List of Donkey Kong characters#Klaptrap|Junior the Klaptrap]]''' - As his name suggests, he is an abnormally large Klaptrap (about Diddy's size). He is voiced by Ron Rubin.\n* '''Kutlass & Green Kroc''' - Skurvy's minions, the former of whom shares a name with [[Kremling Krew|one of the enemies]] from the second game.\n* '''Polly Roger the Parrot''' - The pet parrot of Kaptain Skurvy, Polly Roger later works for K. Rool. He and Klump do not get along well.\n* '''Baby Kong''' - First appeared on the show as DK after having drunk a youth potion. Confusingly, he appeared again as a separate character from DK in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', similar to how [[Baby Mario]] showed up as a different character from [[Mario]] in his sports games.\n* '''Robot Candy Clone''' - A robot look-alike of Candy created by K. Rool to lure DK into certain traps.\n* '''Kong Fu''' - A martial arts \"Kung Fu Master\" who is hired by K. Rool to defeat Donkey Kong in the Annual Donkey Kong Challenge. He only appears in one episode with the same name. His name was later used in the French version of [[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]] for the boss Karate Kong.\n* '''Eddie the Mean Old Yeti''' - A white-furred [[yeti]] who lives alone in the White Mountains. He doesn't seem to like it when other characters intrude on his territory.\n* '''Inka Dinka Doo''' - The temple god from where the Crystal Coconut came. It was he who selected DK to be the future ruler. He appears as a stone column on which expressions are featured. This stone block turns around to show the expression that matches his current mood.\n* '''Metal Head''' - Donkey Kong after exchanging minds with Bluster's robot.\n\n==Voice cast==\nSeason 1 of the French version was done in Quebec, with the exception of Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong<ref>http://www.rsdoublage.com/comedien-512-Herve-Grull.html</ref> and Funky Kong's voice actors who are from France. Season 2 was not given a French version until later when it got released on DVD years afterwards, which had a new voice cast and it was done in France, with DK and Funky's voice actors reprising their character roles. Herv\u00e9 Grull did not return as Diddy Kong as he had long since hit puberty and was replaced by an adult woman as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planete-jeunesse.com/fiche-1679-donkey-kong.html |title= Plan\u00e8te Jeunesse - Donkey Kong |publisher=planete-jeunesse.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character Role\n!{{flagicon|Quebec}} French (Season 1)\n!{{flagicon|France}} French (Season 2)\n!{{flagicon|Canada}} English\n!{{flagicon|Japan}} Japanese\n|-\n|Donkey Kong \n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|Franck Capillery\n|[[Richard Yearwood]]\n|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]\n|-\n|Diddy Kong\n|Herv\u00e9 Grull\n|Lucile Boulanger\n|[[Andrew Sabiston]]\n|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n|-\n|Cranky Kong\n|Yves Massicotte\n|Yves Barsacq\n|[[Aron Tager|Aaron Tager]]\n|[[Ryusei Nakao]]\n|-\n|Funky Kong\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|Emmanuel Curtil\n|[[Damon D'Oliveira]]\n|Banana Ice\n|-\n|Candy Kong\n|Camille Cyr-Desmarais\n|Odile Schmitt\n|[[Joy Tanner]]\n|[[Mika Kanai]]\n|-\n|Dixie Kong\n|Unknown\n|Annie Barclay\n|[[Louise Vallance]]\n|[[Becky (television personality)|Becky]]\n|-\n|Bluster Kong\n|Daniel Lesourd\n|Patrice Dozier\n|Donald Burda\n|[[Daiki Nakamura]]\n|-\n|King K.

However, these episodes are not in chronological order, as a flashback shown in the third episode actually occurs in the fourth episode of the tape. It was released in Canada around 1997 with distribution handled by [[Seville Pictures]] and [[Nelvana]] themselves as the secondary distributor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhscollector.com/movie/donkey-kong-country-legend-crystal-coconut |title=Donkey Kong Country: The Legend Of The Crystal Coconut - Your VHS Collector |publisher=vhscollector.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-12}}</ref> The United States version of the tape was distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Video]] and was released in the nation on November 9, 1999, marking this the only time that the U.S. had a VHS release of this series.\n\nIn Japan, the TV series was very popular and proven to be successful, since the videogames that the series is based on, was also a hit. It was also because the Japanese [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] version of the series was produced with a very high budget thus investing to having a big-name well known voice cast. The Japanese dubbed version of the entire series has been released on home video through Rental VHS tapes in 2000. [[Shogakukan|Shogakukan Video]] has released all the episodes of the series spreading through 13 volumes and they were sold by [[Nippon Columbia]], a record label company. Each tape contains three episodes each and in consistent order of its Japanese broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]], with the exception of its series finale, ''Message in a Bottle Show'' was not included due to mostly being a clip episode. However, that episode was later introduced as part of another TV Tokyo program which is a quiz show known as ''Ohashi.''\n\nIn the PAL regions, ''Donkey Kong Country Vol.1'' (released in Australia) and ''Donkey Kong Country - Bad Hair Day'' (released in the United Kingdom) were released on DVD. The other two DVDs, ''Donkey Kong Country: Hooray for Holly Kongo Bongo'' and ''Donkey Kong Country: The Kongo Bongo Festival of Lights'' (both released in Australia) only held one episode. After over three years of no new English DVD, ''I Spy With My Hairy Eye'' was released in the UK in 2008.\n\nFinally in 2013, [[Phase 4 Films]], a small Canadian low-budget film company, officially purchased the rights to license and distribute the series for a DVD release in Region 1 alongside with [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]  and began releasing episodes starting off with the ''He Came, He Saw, He Kong-quered'' DVD that was released on August 20, 2013. The Complete First Season was then released on DVD in Region 1 on May 12, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-Country-Came-Kong-quered/dp/B00CPKZLDY |title=Amazon.com Donkey Kong Country: He Came, He Saw, He Kong-quered  |publisher=amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-Country-Season-1/dp/B00TJ57SWA |title= Amazon.com: Donkey Kong Country: Season 1 |publisher=amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, [[Pidax Film]] has gotten the distribution rights in Germany to release all fourteen episodes of Season 2 on DVD with English and German dubbing audio included. Germany still has yet to get a release of the first season.\n\nThe episodes of the show are all available on iTunes.\n\n39/40 episodes are available on Retro Rerun's YouTube channel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Release Date!!Episodes!!Region!!Additional Information\n|-\n|''The Legend of the Crystal Coconut''||1997 (Canada) <br/> November 9, 1999 (USA and Canada)|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VHS||Includes ''Legend of the Crystal Coconut'', ''Bug a Boogie'', ''Ape-Nesia'', and ''Booty and the Beast'' edited together in a feature-length format.\n|-\n|''\u30c9\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30b0 Vol. 1 (Donkey Kong Vol. 1)''||rowspan=\"3\" |June 21, 2000|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VHS||Includes Japanese dubbed versions of Episodes 1-3 (''Bad Hair Day'', ''Ape Foo Young'' and ''Booty and the Beast'').\n|-\n|''\u30c9\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30b0 Vol. 2 (Donkey Kong Vol. 2)''|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VHS||Includes Japanese dubbed versions of Episodes 4-6 (''Barrel, Barrel...
