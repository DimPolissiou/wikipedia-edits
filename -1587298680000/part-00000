Only another pillar fragment, the [[Pataliputra capital]], is possibly from a slightly earlier date. It is thought that before the 3rd century BC, wood rather than stone was used as the main material for Indian architectural constructions, and that stone may have been adopted following interaction with the [[Persians]] and the [[Greeks]].<ref>''India: The Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Subcontinent from c. 7000 BCE to CE 1200'', Burjor Avari, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XziTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT149 p.149]</ref>  A graphic representation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] from the column there was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] in 1950.<ref>[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem], Know India india.gov.in</ref>\n\nAll the pillars of Ashoka were built at Buddhist monasteries, many important sites from the life of the [[Buddha]] and places of pilgrimage.  Some of the columns carry inscriptions addressed to the monks and nuns.<ref>Companion, 430</ref>  Some were erected to commemorate visits by Ashoka.\n\nMajor Pillars are present in Indian [[States and union territories of India|State]] of [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh|Uttar]] [[Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh|Madhya]] [[Pradesh]] and some parts of [[Haryana]]\n\nKuwait is the best country\n\n==Construction==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n|direction=horizontal\n | total_width =365\n|title=Possible sources of inspiration\n | image1 = Naxos_Sphinx_with_humans_for_size.jpg\n | width1 = 250\n | caption1 = [[Sphinx of Naxos|Sphinx of the Naxians]], [[Delphi]], c. 6th BCE.<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n | image2 =Achaemenid_capital_Persepolis.jpg\n | width2=115\n | caption2 = Highly polished [[Persian columns|Achaemenid load-bearing column]] with lotus capital and animals, [[Persepolis]], c. 5th-4th BCE.\n}}\n{{see also|Mauryan polish}}\nThe traditional idea that all were originally quarried at [[Chunar]], just south of [[Varanasi]] and taken to their sites, before or after carving, \"can no longer be confidently asserted\",<ref>Harle, 22</ref> and instead it seems that the columns were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white [[sandstone]] from the region of Mathura, the others of buff-colored fine grained [[Chunar stone|hard sandstone]] usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem that stone was transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found, and there was cut and carved by craftsmen.<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryan'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.267-70</ref>\n\nThe pillars have four component parts in two pieces: the three sections of the capitals are made in a single piece, often of a different stone to that of the [[monolith]]ic shaft to which they are attached by a large metal [[dowel]]. The shafts are always plain and smooth, circular in cross-section, slightly tapering upwards and always chiselled out of a single piece of stone. There is no distinct base at the bottom of the shaft.  The lower parts of the capitals have the shape and appearance of a gently arched bell formed of lotus petals.

The earliest one seems to be the [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] pillar, with its stout and short column, the rigid lion and the undecorated square abacus. Next would follow the [[Sankissa]] elephant and the [[Rampurva]] bull, also not yet benefiting from [[Mauryan polish]], and using a Hellenistic abacus of lotus and [[palmette]]s for decoration. The abacus would then adopt the [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] goose as an animal decorative symbol, in [[Lauria Nandangarh]] and the [[Rampurva]] lion. [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]] would mark the culmination with four animals back-to-back instead of just one, and a new and sophisticated animal and symbolic abacus (the elephant, the bull, the lion, the horse alternating with the [[Dharma wheel]]) for the Sarnath lion.<ref>Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.42</ref>\n\nOther chronological orders have also been proposed, for example based on the style of the Ashokan inscriptions on the pillars, since the stylistically most sophisticated pillars actually have the engravings of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] of the  worst quality (namely, very poorly engraved [[Commons:Category:Schism Edict of Ashoka|Schism Edicts]] on the [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]] pillars, their only inscriptions). This approach offers an almost reverse chronological order to the preceding one.<ref name=Irwin1983>The True Chronology of A\u015bokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 247-265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]</ref> According to Irwin, the [[Sankissa]] elephant and [[Rampurva]] bull pillars with their Hellenistic abacus are pre-Ashokan. Ashoka would then have commissioned the Sarnath pillar with its famous [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] to be built under the tutelage of crafstmen from the former [[Achaemenid Empire]], trained in Perso-Hellenistic statuary, whereas the Brahmi engraving on the very same pillar (and on pillars of the same period such as [[Sanchi]] and Kosambi-Allahabad) was made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India.<ref name=Irwin1983/> After Ashoka sent back the foreign artists, style degraded over a short period of time, down to the time when the [[Major Pillar Edicts]] were engraved at the end of Ashoka's reign, which now displayed very good inscriptional craftsmanship but a much more solemn and less elegant style for the associated lion capitals, as for the [[Lauria Nandangarh]] lion and the [[Rampurva]] lion.<ref name=Irwin1983/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=1 cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%; width: 100%;\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Known capitals of the pillars of Ashoka'''<br/><small>Ordered chronologically based on stylistic and technical analysis.<ref>Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.42</ref></small>\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India 2007-01-29.jpg|[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] lion\nFile:Elephant capital Sankasya.jpg|[[Sankissa]] elephant.\nFile:Rampurva bull in Presidential Palace high closeup.jpg|[[Rampurva]] [[zebu]] bull original (now in [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], [[New Delhi]]).\nFile:Lauria Nandangarh lion.jpg|[[Lauria Nandangarh]] lion.\nFile:Lion Capital - Chunar Sandstone - Circa 3rd Century BCE - Rampurva - ACCN 6298-6299 - Indian Museum - Kolkata 2014-04-04 4432.JPG|[[Rampurva]] lion.\nFile:Sanchi capital right side view.jpg|Four lions, once possibly crowned by a wheel, from [[Sanchi]].\nFile:Sarnath capital.jpg|The \"[[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]\", from [[Sarnath]].\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nOf the [[Allahabad pillar]], only the abacus remains, the bottom bulb and the crowning animal having been lost.

The inscriptions on the columns join other, more numerous, Ashokan inscriptions on natural rock faces to form the body of texts known as the Edicts of Ashoka. These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]] and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail [[Ashoka's policy of Dhamma]], an earnest attempt to solve some of problems that a complex society faced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-ashokan-rock-edicts-are-a-marvel-of-history/20170808.htm?sc_cid=twshare|title=The Ashokan rock edicts are a marvel of history}}</ref>  In these inscriptions, Ashoka refers to himself as \"Beloved servant of the Gods\" (''Devanampiyadasi'').  The inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread Buddhism, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and [[animal welfare]] program.  The edicts were based on Ashoka's ideas on administration and behaviour of people towards one another and religion.\n\n[[Alexander Cunningham]], one of the first to study the inscriptions on the pillars, remarks that they are written in eastern, middle and western [[Prakrit]]s which he calls \"the Punjabi or north-western dialect, the Ujjeni or middle dialect, and the Magadhi or eastern dialect.\"<ref>''Inscriptions of Ashoka'' by Alexander Cunningham, Eugen Hultzsch.

Four lions are seated back to back. At present the Column remains in the same place whereas the Lion Capital is at the Sarnath Museum. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]] and the wheel \"Ashoka Chakra\" from its base was placed onto the centre of the [[flag of India]].\n\nThe lions probably originally supported a [[Dharma Chakra]] wheel with 24 spokes, such as is preserved in the 13th century replica erected at [[Wat Umong]] near [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]] by Thai king [[Mangrai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=286 |title=Wat Umong Chiang Mai |website=Thailand's World |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Adoration of the pillar of Ashoka Sanchi Stupa 3 South Gateway Right pillar top panel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of the four lions capital surmounted by a [[Wheel of Law]] at Sanchi, [[Satavahana]] period, South gateway of [[stupa]] 3.]]\n \nThe pillar at Sanchi also has a similar but damaged four-lion capital. There are two pillars at Rampurva, one with a bull and the other with a lion as crowning animals. [[Sankissa]] has only a damaged elephant capital, which is mainly unpolished, though the abacus is at least partly so.  No pillar shaft has been found, and perhaps this was never erected at the site.<ref>Companion, 428-429</ref>\n\nThe [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] pillar has a single lion capital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Destinations :: Vaishali|url=http://bstdc.bih.nic.in/Vaishali.htm}}</ref>  The location of this pillar is contiguous to the site where a Buddhist monastery and a sacred coronation tank stood. Excavations are still underway and several stupas suggesting a far flung campus for the monastery have been discovered.  The lion faces north, the direction Buddha took on his last voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bstdc.bih.nic.in/Vaishali.htm|title=Destinations :: Vaishali ::Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation|website=bstdc.bih.nic.in|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> Identification of the site for excavation in 1969 was aided by the fact that this pillar still jutted out of the soil. More such pillars exist in this greater area but they are all devoid of the capital.\n\n===Pillar at Allahabad===\n{{main article|Allahabad pillar|Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudra Gupta}}\nIn [[Allahabad]] there is a pillar with inscriptions from [[Ashoka]] and later inscriptions attributed to [[Samudragupta]] and [[Jehangir]]. It is clear from the inscription that the pillar was first erected at [[Kosambi|Kaushambi]], an ancient town some 30 kilometres west of Allahabad that was the capital of the [[Koshala]] kingdom, and moved to Allahabad, presumably under Muslim rule.<ref>Krishnaswamy, 697-700</ref>  \n\nThe pillar is now located inside the [[Allahabad Fort]], also the royal palace, built during the 16th century by [[Akbar]] at the confluence of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers. As the fort is occupied by the [[Indian Army]] it is essentially closed to the public and special permission is required to see the pillar.  The Ashokan inscription is in [[Brahmi]] and is dated around 232 BC. A later inscription attributed to the second king of the [[Gupta empire]], [[Samudragupta]], is in the more refined [[Gupta script]], a later version of Brahmi, and is dated to around 375 AD. This inscription lists the extent of the empire that Samudragupta built during his long reign. He had already been king for forty years at that time and would rule for another five. A still later inscription in [[Persian language|Persian]] is from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Jahangir]]. The Akbar Fort also houses the [[Akshay Vat]], an [[Sacred fig|Indian fig tree]] of great antiquity. The [[Ramayana]] refers to this tree under which Lord [[Rama]] is supposed to have prayed while on exile.\n\n===Pillars at Lauriya-Areraj and Lauriya-Nandangarh===\nThe column at [[Lauriya-Nandangarh]], 23&nbsp;km from [[Bettiah]] in [[West Champaran district]], [[Bihar]] has single lion capital. The hump and the hind legs of the lion project beyond the abacus.<ref name=\"mahajan\"/> The pillar at Lauriya-Areraj in [[East Champaran district]], [[Bihar]] is presently devoid of any capital.\n\n===Erecting the Pillars===\nThe Pillars of Ashoka may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient [[obelisk]]s. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html|title=NOVA Online - Mysteries of the Nile - August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57</ref>\n\n==Rediscoveries==\n[[File:Buddha in Sarnath.jpg|thumb|Rediscovery of the Ashoka pillar in [[Sarnath]], 1905.]]\nA number of the pillars were thrown down by either natural causes or iconoclasts, and gradually rediscovered. One was noticed in the 16th century by the English traveller [[Thomas Coryat]] in the ruins of [[Old Delhi]]. Initially he assumed that from the way it glowed that it was made of brass, but on closer examination he realized it was made of highly polished sandstone with upright script that resembled a form of Greek. In the 1830s [[James Prinsep]] began to decipher them with the help of Captain Edward Smith and [[George Turnour]]. They determined that the script referred to King Piyadasi which was also the epithet of an Indian ruler known as Ashoka who came to the throne 218 years after Buddha's enlightenment. Scholars have since found 150 of Ashoka's inscriptions, carved into the face of rocks or on stone pillars marking out a domain that stretched across northern India and south below the central plateau of the Deccan. These pillars were placed in strategic sites near border cities and trade routes.\n\nThe [[Sanchi]] pillar was found in 1851 in excavations led by Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], first head of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].  There were no surviving traces above ground of the Sarnath pillar, mentioned in the accounts of medieval Chinese pilgrims, when the Indian Civil Service engineer [[F.O. Oertel]], with no real experience in archaeology, was allowed to excavate there in the winter of 1904\u201305.  He first uncovered the remains of a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] shrine west of the main [[stupa]], overlying an Ashokan structure.  To the west of that he found the lowest section of the pillar, upright but broken off near ground level. Most of the rest of the pillar was found in three sections nearby, and then, since the Sanchi capital had been excavated in 1851, the search for an equivalent was continued, and the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], the most famous of the group, was found close by.  It was both finer in execution and in much better condition than that at Sanchi.  The pillar appeared to have been deliberately destroyed at some point.  The finds were recognised as so important that the first onsite museum in India (and one of the few then in the world) was set up to house them.<ref>Allen, Chapter 15</ref>\n\n==Other Ashokan structures==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n|direction=horizontal\n | total_width =500\n|title=The Buddha's Diamond Throne and the Pillars of Ashoka\n | image1 = Diamond_throne_discovery.jpg\n | width1 = 325\n | caption1 = Discovery of Ashoka's [[Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya|Diamond throne]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], near the spot of the Buddha's illumination and the [[Boddhi tree]].\n | image2 =Decorative bands of the Diamond Throne (top) and the Sanchi pillar capital (bottom).jpg\n | width2=150\n | caption2 = Side decorative bands of the Diamond Throne (top) and the [[Sanchi]] pillar capital (bottom), both featuring geese and [[flame palmette]]s.\n | image3=Decorative friezes of the Diamond Throne (top) and the Sankissal pillar capital (bottom).jpg\n | width3=150\n | caption3=Front decorative friezes of the Diamond Throne (top) and the [[Sankissa]] pillar capital (bottom), both alternating flame palmettes, [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s and lotuses.\n}}\n;Stupas\nLegend has it that Ashoka built 84,000 [[stupa]]s commemorating the events and relics of Buddha's life.

Ashoka was reputedly a tyrant at the outset of his reign. Eight years after his accession he [[Kalinga War|campaigned in Kalinga]] where in his own words, \"a hundred and fifty thousand people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and as many as that perished...\" As he explains in his edicts, after this event Ashoka converted to Buddhism in remorse for the loss of life. Buddhism did not become a state religion but with Ashoka's support it spread rapidly. The inscriptions on the pillars set out edicts about morality based on Buddhist tenets.<ref>Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ancient India: Land Of Mystery (1994) p. 84-85,94-97</ref><ref>Oliphant, Margaret \"The Atlas Of The Ancient World\" 1992 p. 156-7</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n|direction=horizontal\n | total_width =365\n|title=Possible sources of inspiration\n | image1 = Naxos_Sphinx_with_humans_for_size.jpg\n | width1 = 250\n | caption1 = [[Sphinx of Naxos|Sphinx of the Naxians]], [[Delphi]], c. 6th BCE.<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n | image2 =Achaemenid_capital_Persepolis.jpg\n | width2=115\n | caption2 = Highly polished [[Persian columns|Achaemenid load-bearing column]] with lotus capital and animals, [[Persepolis]], c. 5th-4th BCE.\n}}\n{{see also|Mauryan polish}}\nThe traditional idea that all were originally quarried at [[Chunar]], just south of [[Varanasi]] and taken to their sites, before or after carving, \"can no longer be confidently asserted\",<ref>Harle, 22</ref> and instead it seems that the columns were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white [[sandstone]] from the region of Mathura, the others of buff-colored fine grained [[Chunar stone|hard sandstone]] usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem that stone was transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found, and there was cut and carved by craftsmen.<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001).

The shafts are always plain and smooth, circular in cross-section, slightly tapering upwards and always chiselled out of a single piece of stone. There is no distinct base at the bottom of the shaft.  The lower parts of the capitals have the shape and appearance of a gently arched bell formed of lotus petals. The abaci are of two types: square and plain and circular and decorated and these are of different proportions. The crowning animals are masterpieces of [[Mauryan art]], shown either seated or standing, always in the round and chiselled as a single piece with the abaci.<ref name=\"mahajan\"/><ref>Companion,</ref>  Presumably all or most of the other columns that now lack them once had capitals and animals.

[[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]] would mark the culmination with four animals back-to-back instead of just one, and a new and sophisticated animal and symbolic abacus (the elephant, the bull, the lion, the horse alternating with the [[Dharma wheel]]) for the Sarnath lion.<ref>Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.42</ref>\n\nOther chronological orders have also been proposed, for example based on the style of the Ashokan inscriptions on the pillars, since the stylistically most sophisticated pillars actually have the engravings of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] of the  worst quality (namely, very poorly engraved [[Commons:Category:Schism Edict of Ashoka|Schism Edicts]] on the [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]] pillars, their only inscriptions). This approach offers an almost reverse chronological order to the preceding one.<ref name=Irwin1983>The True Chronology of A\u015bokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 247-265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]</ref> According to Irwin, the [[Sankissa]] elephant and [[Rampurva]] bull pillars with their Hellenistic abacus are pre-Ashokan. Ashoka would then have commissioned the Sarnath pillar with its famous [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] to be built under the tutelage of crafstmen from the former [[Achaemenid Empire]], trained in Perso-Hellenistic statuary, whereas the Brahmi engraving on the very same pillar (and on pillars of the same period such as [[Sanchi]] and Kosambi-Allahabad) was made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India.<ref name=Irwin1983/> After Ashoka sent back the foreign artists, style degraded over a short period of time, down to the time when the [[Major Pillar Edicts]] were engraved at the end of Ashoka's reign, which now displayed very good inscriptional craftsmanship but a much more solemn and less elegant style for the associated lion capitals, as for the [[Lauria Nandangarh]] lion and the [[Rampurva]] lion.<ref name=Irwin1983/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=1 cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%; width: 100%;\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Known capitals of the pillars of Ashoka'''<br/><small>Ordered chronologically based on stylistic and technical analysis.<ref>Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.42</ref></small>\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India 2007-01-29.jpg|[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] lion\nFile:Elephant capital Sankasya.jpg|[[Sankissa]] elephant.\nFile:Rampurva bull in Presidential Palace high closeup.jpg|[[Rampurva]] [[zebu]] bull original (now in [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], [[New Delhi]]).\nFile:Lauria Nandangarh lion.jpg|[[Lauria Nandangarh]] lion.\nFile:Lion Capital - Chunar Sandstone - Circa 3rd Century BCE - Rampurva - ACCN 6298-6299 - Indian Museum - Kolkata 2014-04-04 4432.JPG|[[Rampurva]] lion.\nFile:Sanchi capital right side view.jpg|Four lions, once possibly crowned by a wheel, from [[Sanchi]].\nFile:Sarnath capital.jpg|The \"[[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]\", from [[Sarnath]].\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nOf the [[Allahabad pillar]], only the abacus remains, the bottom bulb and the crowning animal having been lost.

The inscriptions on the columns join other, more numerous, Ashokan inscriptions on natural rock faces to form the body of texts known as the Edicts of Ashoka. These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]] and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism.

The inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread Buddhism, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and [[animal welfare]] program.  The edicts were based on Ashoka's ideas on administration and behaviour of people towards one another and religion.\n\n[[Alexander Cunningham]], one of the first to study the inscriptions on the pillars, remarks that they are written in eastern, middle and western [[Prakrit]]s which he calls \"the Punjabi or north-western dialect, the Ujjeni or middle dialect, and the Magadhi or eastern dialect.\"<ref>''Inscriptions of Ashoka'' by Alexander Cunningham, Eugen Hultzsch.

Four lions are seated back to back. At present the Column remains in the same place whereas the Lion Capital is at the Sarnath Museum. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]] and the wheel \"Ashoka Chakra\" from its base was placed onto the centre of the [[flag of India]].\n\nThe lions probably originally supported a [[Dharma Chakra]] wheel with 24 spokes, such as is preserved in the 13th century replica erected at [[Wat Umong]] near [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]] by Thai king [[Mangrai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=286 |title=Wat Umong Chiang Mai |website=Thailand's World |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Adoration of the pillar of Ashoka Sanchi Stupa 3 South Gateway Right pillar top panel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of the four lions capital surmounted by a [[Wheel of Law]] at Sanchi, [[Satavahana]] period, South gateway of [[stupa]] 3.]]\n \nThe pillar at Sanchi also has a similar but damaged four-lion capital. There are two pillars at Rampurva, one with a bull and the other with a lion as crowning animals. [[Sankissa]] has only a damaged elephant capital, which is mainly unpolished, though the abacus is at least partly so.  No pillar shaft has been found, and perhaps this was never erected at the site.<ref>Companion, 428-429</ref>\n\nThe [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] pillar has a single lion capital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Destinations :: Vaishali|url=http://bstdc.bih.nic.in/Vaishali.htm}}</ref>  The location of this pillar is contiguous to the site where a Buddhist monastery and a sacred coronation tank stood. Excavations are still underway and several stupas suggesting a far flung campus for the monastery have been discovered.  The lion faces north, the direction Buddha took on his last voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bstdc.bih.nic.in/Vaishali.htm|title=Destinations :: Vaishali ::Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation|website=bstdc.bih.nic.in|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> Identification of the site for excavation in 1969 was aided by the fact that this pillar still jutted out of the soil. More such pillars exist in this greater area but they are all devoid of the capital.\n\n===Pillar at Allahabad===\n{{main article|Allahabad pillar|Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudra Gupta}}\nIn [[Allahabad]] there is a pillar with inscriptions from [[Ashoka]] and later inscriptions attributed to [[Samudragupta]] and [[Jehangir]]. It is clear from the inscription that the pillar was first erected at [[Kosambi|Kaushambi]], an ancient town some 30 kilometres west of Allahabad that was the capital of the [[Koshala]] kingdom, and moved to Allahabad, presumably under Muslim rule.<ref>Krishnaswamy, 697-700</ref>  \n\nThe pillar is now located inside the [[Allahabad Fort]], also the royal palace, built during the 16th century by [[Akbar]] at the confluence of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers. As the fort is occupied by the [[Indian Army]] it is essentially closed to the public and special permission is required to see the pillar.  The Ashokan inscription is in [[Brahmi]] and is dated around 232 BC. A later inscription attributed to the second king of the [[Gupta empire]], [[Samudragupta]], is in the more refined [[Gupta script]], a later version of Brahmi, and is dated to around 375 AD. This inscription lists the extent of the empire that Samudragupta built during his long reign. He had already been king for forty years at that time and would rule for another five. A still later inscription in [[Persian language|Persian]] is from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Jahangir]]. The Akbar Fort also houses the [[Akshay Vat]], an [[Sacred fig|Indian fig tree]] of great antiquity. The [[Ramayana]] refers to this tree under which Lord [[Rama]] is supposed to have prayed while on exile.\n\n===Pillars at Lauriya-Areraj and Lauriya-Nandangarh===\nThe column at [[Lauriya-Nandangarh]], 23&nbsp;km from [[Bettiah]] in [[West Champaran district]], [[Bihar]] has single lion capital.

Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html|title=NOVA Online - Mysteries of the Nile - August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57</ref>\n\n==Rediscoveries==\n[[File:Buddha in Sarnath.jpg|thumb|Rediscovery of the Ashoka pillar in [[Sarnath]], 1905.]]\nA number of the pillars were thrown down by either natural causes or iconoclasts, and gradually rediscovered. One was noticed in the 16th century by the English traveller [[Thomas Coryat]] in the ruins of [[Old Delhi]]. Initially he assumed that from the way it glowed that it was made of brass, but on closer examination he realized it was made of highly polished sandstone with upright script that resembled a form of Greek. In the 1830s [[James Prinsep]] began to decipher them with the help of Captain Edward Smith and [[George Turnour]]. They determined that the script referred to King Piyadasi which was also the epithet of an Indian ruler known as Ashoka who came to the throne 218 years after Buddha's enlightenment. Scholars have since found 150 of Ashoka's inscriptions, carved into the face of rocks or on stone pillars marking out a domain that stretched across northern India and south below the central plateau of the Deccan. These pillars were placed in strategic sites near border cities and trade routes.\n\nThe [[Sanchi]] pillar was found in 1851 in excavations led by Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], first head of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].  There were no surviving traces above ground of the Sarnath pillar, mentioned in the accounts of medieval Chinese pilgrims, when the Indian Civil Service engineer [[F.O. Oertel]], with no real experience in archaeology, was allowed to excavate there in the winter of 1904\u201305.  He first uncovered the remains of a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] shrine west of the main [[stupa]], overlying an Ashokan structure.  To the west of that he found the lowest section of the pillar, upright but broken off near ground level. Most of the rest of the pillar was found in three sections nearby, and then, since the Sanchi capital had been excavated in 1851, the search for an equivalent was continued, and the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], the most famous of the group, was found close by.  It was both finer in execution and in much better condition than that at Sanchi.  The pillar appeared to have been deliberately destroyed at some point.  The finds were recognised as so important that the first onsite museum in India (and one of the few then in the world) was set up to house them.<ref>Allen, Chapter 15</ref>\n\n==Other Ashokan structures==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n|direction=horizontal\n | total_width =500\n|title=The Buddha's Diamond Throne and the Pillars of Ashoka\n | image1 = Diamond_throne_discovery.jpg\n | width1 = 325\n | caption1 = Discovery of Ashoka's [[Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya|Diamond throne]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], near the spot of the Buddha's illumination and the [[Boddhi tree]].\n | image2 =Decorative bands of the Diamond Throne (top) and the Sanchi pillar capital (bottom).jpg\n | width2=150\n | caption2 = Side decorative bands of the Diamond Throne (top) and the [[Sanchi]] pillar capital (bottom), both featuring geese and [[flame palmette]]s.\n | image3=Decorative friezes of the Diamond Throne (top) and the Sankissal pillar capital (bottom).jpg\n | width3=150\n | caption3=Front decorative friezes of the Diamond Throne (top) and the [[Sankissa]] pillar capital (bottom), both alternating flame palmettes, [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s and lotuses.\n}}\n;Stupas\nLegend has it that Ashoka built 84,000 [[stupa]]s commemorating the events and relics of Buddha's life.

During the [[Winter War]] from November 1939 to March 1940, the regiment flew 3,412 [[sorties]] while operating from Gorelovo in the north-western borders of the [[Soviet Union]], earning the award the [[Order of the Red Banner]]. In March 1951, Gorelovo became home to the 29th Guards Fighter Aviation Volkhov Regiment returning from the [[Korean War]], and was established as part of the [[air defense system]] for Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). In 1952, the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was also based at Gorelovo until June 21, 1965, when the regiment was disbanded. \n\nIn May 1969, the 29th Guards Fighter Aviation Volkhov Regiment was disbanded, and the airfield was transferred to the 419th Aircraft Repair Plant, and part of the regiment's premises was occupied by the Leningrad Higher Military-Political School of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].<ref>http://www.ww2.dk/new/air%20force/division/schools/lvvpu.htm</ref> Until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Gorelovo was primarily used by military [[transport plane]]s such as the [[Antonov An-8]] and [[An-12]] heading to airfields in the [[Baltic Military District]].
