{"title_page": "TENET 210", "text_new": "The '''TENET 210''' was a [[mainframe computer]] designed for [[timesharing]] services. The machine was designed for high [[throughput]] and expandability, including 20 [[direct memory access]] (DMA) channels and eight slots for [[core memory]], allowing up to 128k [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] words of RAM. The sales materials boasted that it guaranteed user responses within one second.\n\nThe 210 was the only product of Tenent Inc, formed by several former members of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] during its heyday in the late 1960s. The company sold only a single 210 before going out of business.\n\n==History==\nThe TENET 210 ultimately traces its history to a project within [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]'s [[research and development]] center in [[Palo Alto, California]] run by [[Gordon Moore]]. A new group organized by Rex Rice was developing a machine specifically for the [[timesharing]] market. Known as the Symbol IIR, the design concept was a machine that ran a [[PL/1]]-like language as its native [[assembler language]], and would be implemented entirely in hardware - no [[microcode]] or [[firmware]] was allowed.{{sfn|Runge|2008|p=78}}\n\nIn 1966, Chuck Runge was working for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], writing programs on a machine at [[Iowa State University]]. Rice visited the campus on a recruiting drive and Runge interviewed with Moore that March. Runge joined the company in June, but quickly became disillusioned with the no-software decree, and was convinced the project would never ship. Along with Dave Masters, who knew Fairchild president [[Bob Noyce]], they approached Noyce with the idea of developing a new computer design.{{sfn|Runge|2008|p=78}}\n\nThe system was initially pitched as a controller for Fairchild Instrumentation's new Sentry product, a software-controlled semiconductor testing system. This produced the [[24-bit computing|24-bit]] Fairchild FST-1, as well as the FACTOR programming language it used to program the test suites. Although it was by most measures a general-purpose [[minicomputer]], Fairchild was uninterested in marketing it as such.{{sfn|Runge|2008}}\n\nAt the time, the [[timesharing]] market was developing rapidly, and had split into two solution classes; the minicomputer end was aimed at smaller users who would buy a complete system for in-house use, like the [[HP 2100]], while at the other end were large mainframes that sold services on a per-minute basis to users on remote [[computer terminal]]s. In 1968, Runge and Masters left Fairchild to form TENEX with the intent of building a mid-range system with the price of the mini offerings but the power of the mainframes.{{sfn|Runge|2008|p=78}}\n\nTo fund development, Runge took a contract with Fairchild to develop the specification for FACTOR. When this was complete, they managed to arrange a 1969 meeting with Fred Adler, a NY trial attorney who had helped fund [[Data General]]. Adler put together a $2 million package to fund the development of two prototypes. Development of the first machine was completed within two years. To introduce the design, in January 1971 they held an open house in which a concert pianist used the prototype as a [[music synthesizer]]. However, the company had the bad fortune of launching sales directly into the leading edge of the [[1973\u20131975 recession]], and further funding was not available.{{sfn|Runge|2008}}\n\n[[Tymshare]] examined the machine as a replacement for the [[SDS 940]]s, and [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a replacement for their initial failed effort for what became the [[HP 3000]], but neither effort was successful. The company's one and only sale was a bid in response to a [[State of California]] [[request for proposal]] for a machine to support their [[civil engineering]] teams designing roads and bridges. They won the bid although by this time the company was already in [[Chapter 11]] protection, maintaining the machine through a separate contract that later included the purchase of the original prototype to use as a [[parts machine]]. This machine was only retired in the 1980s.{{sfn|Runge|2008}}\n\n==Design==\nThe basic concept arranged the machine around a high-performance memory bus they referred to as the \"data exchange\". In the 200-series design, the only one to be built, there were two independent 32-bit busses. Each could perform a read and a write at the same time, as long as they were to different locations in memory. In total, the bus could provide 20&nbsp;MB/sec bandwidth. Core memory was connected on one side of the bus, with up to eight modules of 8 to 16k words each. Fully expanded, a system could have 8 x 16 = 128 kWords, or 512&nbsp;kB.{{sfn|Brochure|1970|p=2}}\n\nThe 210 was a single-processor design, but in theory up to four 3210 CPUs could be connected to the bus. In the 210, the CPU had two connections to the bus, allowing it to perform a total of four memory operations per cycle.{{sfn|Brochure|1970|p=3}} There were twenty ports in total to the bus, so in the 210 there were eighteen free ports on the data bus. Expansion systems included a disk controller which could run one to four 25&nbsp;MB [[hard drive]]s, a communications card for up to 16 terminals each, card readers, printer outputs and tape drives.{{sfn|Brochure|1970|pp=1,5}}\n\nA significant aspect of the design was its [[paging|memory paging]] system, which used conventional hard drives rather than the custom [[memory drum]]s or specialized hard disks with multiple [[read/write head]]s (a random-access disk, or RAD). Making this work with reasonable performance required significant efforts to tune the [[input/output]] routines to avoid unnecessary reads and writes, which was handled in the system's hardware [[memory management unit]]. Time-to-market and overall cost was also reduced through the use of off-the-shelf [[TTL]] [[small scale integration]] circuits.{{sfn|Runge|2008}}\n\nThe CPU was designed to minimize the length of code as a further effort to reduce memory swapping. It included eight general-purpose registers and a separate set of eight control registers.{{sfn|Brochure|1970|p=3}} Its [[instruction set]] included a variety of \"rich\" instructions for packing and unpacking bytes into words, gathering and scattering data in memory, test-and-set, pre- and post-indexing and pattern matching against memory. The Programmed Instructions, or PINS, were designed to improve the density of [[subroutine]] calls; a single 32-bit word called a routine and passed a single parameter. There were sixteen global PINS, hard-wired to key [[operating system]] routines. A further 48 PINS were available for user programs.{{sfn|Brochure|1970|p=4}}\n\nThe system was primarily intended to be used by end-user programmers.

It is the first installment in the ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' series, created by [[Oji Hiroi]]. Originally released for the [[Sega Saturn]], it was later ported to other systems including the [[Dreamcast]] and remade for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Defined by Sega as a \"dramatic adventure\" game, ''Sakura Wars'' combines overlapping [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]], and [[visual novel]] gameplay elements.\n\nSet in a fictionalized version of 1923 in the [[Taish\u014d]] era, the game follows the exploits of the Imperial Combat Revue, a military unit dedicated to fighting supernatural threats against Tokyo while maintaining their cover as a theater troupe. [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Ensign Ichiro Ogami is assigned leader of its all-female Flower Division, a group of women with magical abilities that defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Koubus. He becomes embroiled in both the group's latest conflict with the Hive of Darkness and the personal lives of its members.\n\nHiroi created the concept for what would become ''Sakura Wars'' in 1990. In 1993, his small team in the Planning Department of Red Company began elaborating on his concept, with full development beginning the following year after being approved by Sega. Several prominent figures were brought on board the project including writer [[Satoru Akahori]], composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]], and character designer [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]]. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players have been able to play ''Sakura Wars'' due to an unofficial [[fan translation]] released in 2019. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest-selling titles for the Saturn, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the ''Sakura Wars'' series. A direct sequel, ''[[Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die]]'', was released in 1998.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| footer    = The two main gameplay modes of ''Sakura Wars'' are social interaction with characters using LIPS, and turn-based strategic battles directly influenced by LIPS interactions.\n\n| image1    = Sakura Wars 1 screenshot A.png\n| width1    = 100\n| alt1      =\n\n| image2    = Sakura Wars 1 screenshot B.png\n| width2    = 100\n| alt2      =\n}}\n''Sakura Wars'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which the player controls Ichiro Ogami and the all-female Flower Division of the Imperial Combat Revue, who must save Tokyo from the Hive of Darkness. Dubbed a \"dramatic adventure\" game and taking place across 10 episodes, the gameplay segments incorporate [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]], and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura1Overview\"/> It has two gameplay modes: an adventure mode and a battle mode. The adventure mode is divided between periods where Ogami navigates the Grand Imperial Theater and interacts with various characters, while the battle mode is governed by a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted grid-based battlefield.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=12}}{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=20}} Progress is saved at the end of each episode, and the player may also save the game during an [[Bumper (broadcasting)|eyecatch]].{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=8\u20139}}\n\nIn the adventure mode, Ogami navigates the theater during limited time sequences between battles. This game introduces the Live & Interactive Picture System (LIPS). When Ogami is faced with critical choices during conversations with both members of the Flower Division and supporting characters within the combat revue, dialogue trees are displayed with a time limit for the player to input. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting their relationship with Ogami and future interactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the cursor over parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=12\u201317}} Each main heroine has different personality quirks that must be taken into consideration while talking with them, with correct responses raising their \"Trust\".<ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=19}}\n\nIn the battle mode, the Flower Division fights demons using machines called Koubus. Each unit has its own turn, with each turn allowing two actions. These actions include \"Attack\", \"Defend\", \"Move\", \"Deathblow\" (a critical strike that can kill a normal enemy in one hit), Charge (store energy for a more powerful action during the next turn), and Heal (which restores [[Health (game terminology)|health points (HP)]] to a chosen unit). Different units specialize in different skills such as support actions, melee attacks, or ranged attacks. Units have varying movement abilities based on available space and unit [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], as well as a separate attack range based on their weapon type.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=20\u201331}} Actions taken during LIPS sequences with members of the Flower Division directly impact battles; raised trust during LIPS segments grant statistic increases and subsequently improve combat ability.{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=19}} The game ends when certain conditions, such as winning a battle, are not met or if the HP on Ogami's Koubu reaches zero, although the player can continue by selecting \"Rematch\".{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=20}} The game also contains animated [[cutscene]]s<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/> and musical numbers.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Sakura Wars characters}}\nIn 1923, [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Ensign Ichiro Ogami is transferred to the Imperial Combat Revue, a secret combat unit based in Tokyo. Meanwhile, swordswoman Sakura Shinguji arrives from [[Sendai]] as the Assault Force's latest recruit and meets Ogami at [[Ueno Park]]. Traveling to the Grand Imperial Theater together, Ogami meets the team's main actresses: Sumire Kanzaki, Maria Tachibana, Iris Chateaubriand, Kanna Kirishima, and Kohran Ri. The theater's manager Ikki Yoneda tells Ogami he has been assigned as an usher. Initially bemused and hurt by his assignment, it turns out to be a bluff to decide his worth. The Imperial Combat Revue also functions as a theater troupe called the Imperial Revue. Central to the unit is the Flower Division, the Imperial Revue's main actresses, who use their spirit powers to defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Koubu.\n\nThe current wave of attacks is being controlled by the Hive of Darkness, a group of black magicians led by [[Tenkai]] and his powerful subordinates the Lords of Death. Tenkai's goal is to restore the shogunate and banish the growing Western influences from Japan, with the Hive of Darkness destroying magical seals around Tokyo that keep a powerful demonic horde at bay. As the Flower Division battles the Hive of Darkness, each member must confront their personal problems to function as an effective combat unit. Ogami also becomes involved in the running of the theater and is witness to on-stage incidents including Sakura bringing down the stage during one performance through her clumsiness, and Kanna and Sumire clashing on stage during another.\n\nThe Flower Division are unsuccessful in preventing the Hive of Darkness from destroying the seals, allowing Tenkai to summon a magical fortress from which he intends to conquer Japan. The Flower Division storm the fortress and destroy Tenkai and the fortress. During these events, Ogami becomes close to each member and can pursue a romantic relationship. The city recovers as the group relaxes, but a surviving Hive of Darkness member Kuroki Satan launches a fresh attack, renaming himself \"Aoi Satan\". He is actually Shinnosuke Yamazaki, a former comrade of Yoneda who was presumed killed with Sakura's father Kazuma when creating the original seals. Yamazaki survived and was possessed by the true [[Satan]], being responsible for controlling the demons and resurrecting Tenkai.\n\nYoneda's deputy, Ayame Fujieda, is turned into a demon using her suppressed feelings for Ogami. Satan summons a great fortress called the Seima Castle from the sea near Tokyo, intent on releasing the population of Hell to overrun humanity. Using the airship ''Mikasa'', the Imperial Combat Revue launch a concentrated attack on the castle. They successfully unite their spiritual power to banish Satan back to Hell. Ayame's demon form is destroyed at the cost of her life, and after bidding farewell she ascends to Heaven as an angel named Michael. After Aoi Satan's defeat, the final scene varies depending on whether Ogami romanced a member of the Flower Division and which member he chose.\n\n==Production==\n===Concept and development===\n[[Oji Hiroi]] created the concept for what would become ''Sakura Wars'' in 1990. He saw a Japanese stage production of the play ''Shanghai Rhapsody'' and was impressed by the spectacle of the acting troop he saw on stage.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/> In 1993, Hiroi and anime composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] worked together on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) adaptation of the video game ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''.<ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/> Hiroi was highly impressed by Tanaka's music, to the point where he wanted him to create a musical set to it. This concept evolved into his wish for Tanaka to score a video game focused on the theater.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Later in 1993, a small team in the Planning Department of Red Company (now [[Red Entertainment]]) led by Hiroi began promoting his concept and planning the game's basic concepts. At this stage, the project was titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}} to connect it with Japan. It was described as an \"example plan\" rather than a practical project. While distinct from the final ''Sakura Wars'' the proposal shared an alternate historical setting with [[steampunk]] technology, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> In addition to Hiroi, the team included Ryoma Kaneko and Naoki Morita, who would later work on ''Sakura Wars'' proper.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} While developing the \"''Sakura''\" proposal, Hiroi and his team created two [[tabletop role-playing game]]s dubbed \"''Sakura 1''\" and \"''Sakura 2''\". This resulted in the strategy elements almost overriding the game's other aspects.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/> Inspired by the combination of tactical combat and the story used in the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, Hiroi steered the project more in that direction. Influences from contemporary anime were also added to bring depth to the story and characters. With the basic elements defined, the team continued refining the project for between half a year and a year. Convinced of the project's potential to become a video game, Hiroi presented \"''Sakura''\" to multiple game companies, but none of them had confidence in the project. Despite his determination to see the project realized, Hiroi put the project aside with no expectation that it would be produced.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=123}}\n\nIn 1994, following Hiroi's decision to put ''Sakura'' aside, [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]]\u2014then vice president of [[Sega]]\u2014contacted him about the possibility of developing a game with a popular mascot character for Sega's in-development [[Sega Saturn]] [[home console]]. Irimajiri wanted a unique video game property for the system and had heard positive feedback about Hiroi's work. Hiroi was initially reluctant but eventually accepted Irimajiri's offer, inviting him and other potential contributors to spend a fortnight's holiday in [[Saipan]].{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> Hiroi later said the decision to work on a game for the Saturn was a hard one, as he had previously worked on games for rival unspecified home console systems. It was Sega's favorable response to his pitch that persuaded him to develop ''Sakura Wars'' on the Saturn.<ref name=\"SakuraDorimanga\"/> Hiroi pitched his old concept for ''Sakura'' to Irimajiri during their stay on Saipan. While Hiroi harbored doubts as to whether such an ambitious and unusual project would be accepted, Irimajiri was convinced. On their return to Japan, Sega and Red Company began development on Hiroi's project.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/>{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=64, 74}} That October, it was given the title ''Sakura Wars'' as there were problems trademarking the ''kanji'' version of ''Sakura'' because it is the native name for [[cherry blossom]]. The word \"''Sakura''\" was written in [[katakana]] instead.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTrademark\"/>\n\nThe inclusion of adventure segments alongside the strategic simulation elements was contentious early on, with some fearing ''Sakura Wars'' would turn into a [[bish\u014djo game]].{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}} The strategic segments were designed to feel like interactive anime battles, with everyone getting a chance to attack as in many anime fight sequences of the time. The wish for an anime style also came through in the adventure segments with LIPS, turning conversations into a kind of confrontation to be won.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}} LIPS was born out of staff frustration with the adventure game tradition of time freezing while the player decided which response to select in a tense situation. By implementing a time limit, the team made ''Sakura Wars'' more interactive and removed this frustration. The \"LIPS\" name was chosen for its distinct sound rather than any special meaning.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} Full development of LIPS began after running a test using a scene where Ogami could choose whether to look inside a shower cubicle.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The battle sequences were inspired by similar scenes found in the ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' and ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' television shows. The two shows' violence was actively referenced during the last battle with the combined final attack of the entire Flower Division. Each battle sequence was hand-crafted by one member of staff to simplify production.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=114}} The game's \"Trust\" system was a means of incorporating simulation elements without utilizing role-playing elements such as experience points. The decision to remove experience points entirely proved controversial within the team.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=341}} According to director Tomoyuki Ito, the process of creating \"Trust\" and associated systems was based on trial and error, mainly around how best to express it.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}}\n\nDevelopment of ''Sakura Wars'' lasted for approximately three years\u2014double the original estimate.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} Hiroi acted as the general producer,<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> while Ito acted as a director.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}} Buildup Entertainment and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]] developed the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) segments,<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/> and the anime cinematics were directed by Shunji Oga and produced by Sega-owned studio Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (later [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> Sega initially outsourced programming to an unnamed external company. By 1995 it had already developed one or two chapters of the game's combat-based content before Hiroi objected to the direction the game was taking. It was becoming a generic simulation game that deviated from his vision. Red Company refused to continue development of the prototype, and it was removed from development. Sega's [[Sega AM1#Overworks|CS Research & Development No. 2]] (CS2 R&D) division desired the game's completion, so they co-developed it with Red Company.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The conflicting gameplay elements needed to be divided between different teams within CS2 R&D, only bringing the two parts together at the end of development.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=114}} Because of this development technique, none of the elements could be effectively tested until the game was close to completion.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128}} As a result of these difficulties, the Sega team found production difficult.<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Sega stated that ''Sakura Wars'' was their most expensive video game production to date, although no exact budget was given.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/>\n\n===Art design===\n[[File:Teikoku Kagekidan Team.jpg|thumb|right|The main cast of ''Sakura Wars'' as portrayed in later [[original video animation]] adaptations. Each character was designed around a particular theme, with battle outfits modelled on [[tuxedo]]s.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102\u2013103}}<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>]]\nManga artist [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]], who at the time was working on the long-running manga series ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]'', designed the main cast.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} His editors resisted letting him do the designs due to his heavy workload, including his commitment to ''Oh My Goddess!''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' was the first time Fujishima had worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property. He was skeptical of the project because of the state it was in when he was first approached. It was in a very early stage of development and neither the story nor gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place at a time when it was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant he would be the character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project in late 1994. His first design was for Sakura.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=89-90}} The first sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right designer.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=89-90}}{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=342}} The positive reception to Fujishima's work, together with his understanding of the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>\n\nFujishima was responsible for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} [[Hidenori Matsubara]] designed the supporting cast and helped with general animation.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} Fujishima found it easy to design the characters as their concepts had been firmly established before he created the first drafts and moved on to the final designs. The designs were meant to communicate the characters' inner thoughts and had to be understandable for players. Due to the game's Taish\u014d period setting, he needed to stop himself adding anachronistic elements like [[fastener]]s.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/> Hiroi made detailed character sheets for Fujishima to use when designing the cast. An example was Sumire, whose personality was communicated through her clothes.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/>{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=4}} Each character had distinct traits, such as a ponytail and [[hakama]] kimono for Sakura. Fujishima combined these elements with his own design ideas for the final artwork.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=319}} The Taish\u014d period meant he could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=4}} His design for each main protagonist\u2014from Ogami to the Flower Division members\u2014directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=14\u201325}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=132}} The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after the [[tuxedo]], and Fujishima compared them with the costumes of the [[Takarazuka Revue]].<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=79}}\n\nFutoshi Nagata created the Koubu mecha designs, along with the game's CGI sequences.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}<ref name=\"SSMinterviewKoubu\"/> His initial design outline from Hiroi was the basic concept of using steampunk technology within the Taish\u014d period.<ref name=\"SakuraRomanticGraph\"/> When designing the Koubu, Nagata was guided by Morita, who showed him photographs of both steam-powered trains and early deep-sea [[diving suit]]s\u2014specifically those made of spherical segments. Nagata did extensive research on the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and consciously avoided the trope of anachronistic near-future technology while creating the designs.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}<ref name=\"Sakura2info\"/> The concept of a diving suit was integrated into the concept for the Koubu being reinforced armor rather than robots. Its front was designed after the steam trains that ran on the Aji Express Line.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewKoubu\"/> For each Flower Division member's Koubu armor, Nagata designed them to mirror their traits and beauty so they would be unique. Since the Koubu were meant to be armor, they were not given faces.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}} Because Nagata was brought on early in the game's production, he had considerable freedom when submitting and adjusting his designs.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=123\u2013124}} When the designs were finalized, Nagata began working full-time on CGI, finishing the first Koubu model in five days.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}\n\n===Scenario and characters===\nWhen Hiroi was creating the original concept for ''Sakura Wars'', he had trouble picking the exact era in which the story would take place. He initially considered using the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], with a focus on the post-war [[black market]].<ref name=\"SakuraGemaga\"/> He also considered setting it shortly before and during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Mainichi\"/> Hiroi eventually abandoned this idea as there was too much documentation about the Sh\u014dwa period making its use as a fantasy setting complicated.<ref name=\"SakuraGemaga\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> He next considered using the [[Meiji period]], which was a time of turbulence after the fall of the isolationist Tokugawa Shogunate that saw Western Culture introduced into Japan. Hiroi also abandoned this idea as Meiji-era Japan could not allow for the \"modern\" feeling he wanted.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> With this in mind, Hiroi settled on using the Taish\u014d period as the setting for ''Sakura Wars''. The Taish\u014d period involved Japan integrating Western culture into its own, allowing for political changes and the emancipation of women after a prolonged feudal period.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/><ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanime\"/> In the original draft, the story was much darker, with a key event being the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] and the resultant breakdown of the Taish\u014d period. This version was almost entirely discarded.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=28}}\n\nHiroi wanted to create a version of the Taish\u014d period where the social advances and freedoms the Japanese began exploring continued without being brought to an end by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake and the subsequent shift to militarism before World War II.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview4\"/> Another reason for using the Taish\u014d period was the lack of documentation about it and Tokyo's development because the Great Kant\u014d earthquake destroyed much of it.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSetting\"/> Originally Hiroi wanted to distinguish the ''Sakura Wars'' Taish\u014d from the historical Taish\u014d by modifying the kanji slightly. He did not do this because his staff wanted a world that blended real and fictional events.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=209}} To further distinguish it, Hiroi made use of steampunk technology in the game's world.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/> Despite it being a fantastic version of the Taish\u014d period, Hiroi did his best to incorporate realistic elements.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> The world's general setting, while conceived by Hiroi, was further developed and fleshed out by Kaneko and Morita.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}}\n\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Satoru Akahori]] wrote the main script and branching storylines.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}} Hiroi felt the script would lose entertainment value if he wrote it himself as the setting was based on family stories.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/> He had previously worked with Akahori on other projects. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi he was highly skeptical, but Hiroi convinced him to come on board.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} When he was first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and [[mecha]].<ref name=\"SakuraCartoon\"/> Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game. Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television series.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still unfinished. The only points that had been finalized were its setting, the overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=129}} Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself and needed to consult frequently with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102}} Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, and worked on script editing and debugging.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}}\n\nCreating strong representative characters was part of Sega's request for a new mascot character for their Saturn system.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> A major element of the cast was taking advantage of the game's setting. It could allow for characters from countries outside Japan\u2014like Russia and France\u2014to be part of the Imperial Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/> During early planning, Hiroi produced character concepts for the Flower Division, imitating [[Glossary of anime and manga#Character traits|character archetypes]] commonly found in high school manga. Using this inspiration, he created a gentle yet strong-willed woman (Sakura), a rival character with a negative first impression (Sumire), a cold leader figure (Maria), a small cute character who would be jealous of the other members (Iris), a woman who would be good at athletics (Kanna) and an oddball character who wore glasses (Kohran).{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102\u2013103}} The role of the male protagonist was given initially to a young man named Kusaku Kanuma, a member of the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] who inherits a blade forged by the Japanese swordsmith [[Muramasa]] and must work with Sakura to pilot a two-person [[Mecha|mech]]. As with most of the draft scenario, the male character underwent major alterations.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=28\u201331}} Most of the protagonist's development into Ichiro Ogami happened after Akahori joined the team. He created Ogami's role as an avatar for the player who could be friends with every member of the Flower Division. The Japanese word for \"wolf\" {{Nihongo|\"''Okami''\"|\u72fc|}}, referring to his energetic personality traits, inspired his name.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=135}}\n\n===Audio===\n====Casting====\nWhen casting actors to voice the game's characters, Hiroi needed people who could both act and sing the musical numbers.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> To this end, he required potential voice actors to have experience with live stage performance and be able to sing.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=125}} Hiroi personally approached each of the voice actresses who played members of the Imperial Combat Revue based on their acting and singing abilities before they were pitched the concept of ''Sakura Wars''. Staff members recommended several actresses to Hiroi.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Bringing together the voice cast for a video game at such an early stage was unheard of at the time. Because of this, the cast recorded their lines and songs as the game was developed.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=15}}\n\n*[[Chisa Yokoyama]] voiced Sakura. Hiroi chose Yokoyama, who had appeared in notable anime series including ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', based on his wish to create a compelling final deathblow line.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> She was originally cast in the role of Iris but was recast in the role of Sakura after Iris' final voice actress was cast.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=126}} Yokoyama was used to recording strong characters, so portraying Sakura as a \"normal\" girl made the role difficult for her to perform.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=116}}\n*[[Urara Takano]] voiced Maria. Hiroi offered her the role because of her positive working experiences with Yokoyama.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=165}} Takano was performing in a concert when Hiroi first approached her. Although the project was in the early stages of development, she was intrigued by Maria's character and agreed to take the role.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=352}}\n*[[Michie Tomizawa]] voiced Sumire. Hiroi first approached her in late 1994 during a Christmas concert on the recommendation of a mutual friend. Hiroi pitched his concept for Sumire, and after seeing Tomizawa's performance offered her the role.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=350}}\n*[[Mayumi Tanaka]] voiced Kanna. Hiroi selected her for the role based on her experience performing the comedic \"handsome man\" archetype in [[kabuki]] stage performances.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=376}} Tanaka was instructed to play Kanna as a tomboyish character unconcerned by her true gender.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=359}}\n*[[Yuriko Fuchizaki]] voiced Kohran. Fujishima recommended her to Hiroi. She was approached in mid-1995 when recording was being planned for the opening and ending themes, and questions were still being asked by the cast about how to portray the characters.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=356}}\n*[[Kumiko Nishihara]] voiced Iris. After hearing Nishihara's performance as Sakura, Yokoyama, who was originally given the role of Iris, suggested they switch roles and Nishihara became Iris' voice actress.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=126}}\n*[[Ai Orikasa]] voiced Ayame. She was planning a fan club concert when Hiroi approached her about ''Sakura Wars'' on Yokoyama's recommendation. After seeing Ayame's performance, Hiroi offered her the role.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=193}} While recording her part, Orikasa encountered difficulties portraying the three different versions of Ayame's character.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=40\u201341}}\n*[[Akio Suyama]] voiced Ogami. At the time, Suyama had little to no voice acting experience and was working part-time at Red Company while training as a voice actor.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=205}} Hiroi was still looking for a voice actor for Ogami but had a limited budget. On hearing of Hiroi's situation, Suyama offered to take on the role, despite there being only a few notable lines. Faced with his budget and time limitations, Hiroi accepted his offer.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> Ogami was the last main character to be cast.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>\n\nOnce selected, Hiroi and Tanaka gathered the cast and told them about the project. They were given pictures of their respective characters.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=14}} The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato. He followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=65\u201366}} Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and told they were just one-third of the script.<ref name=\"Sakura2setting\"/> Sato told the cast voices would be the characters' main emotive force, as the faces of character portraits would be mostly static.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=205}} Sakura was the last character to be recorded so Sato could focus on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=46}}\n\n====Music====\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Sakura Wars Soundtrack: Steam Gramophone\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          =\n| released     = May 2, 1997\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       = 21:25 (disc one)<br/>74:30 (disc two)\n| label        = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Japan]]/Lipop Record\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nThe score for ''Sakura Wars'' was [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]]'s first successful video game music composition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> He was among the first people to offer support for Hiroi's vision, as few people believed the project would come to fruition.<ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> Tanaka was also among the first brought on board for production and served as a teacher figure to the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> In a later interview, he stated that he felt like his composing career was at risk while supporting the game.<ref name=\"SilInfoTanaka\"/> When he began composing the score in 1995, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> While thinking about how he could construct the music, Tanaka looked at popular music from the game's time period and worked to re-create its melodies and structure using the popular music styles of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Sakura2Song\"/> Because of the setting and Tanaka's goals, he was able to incorporate multiple music genres including jazz, rumba, and samba alongside more traditional Japanese musical styles.<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/>\n\nTanaka initially planned 50 songs, but this was too many to record and fit into the game within the allotted time and budget. The number was reduced to 24, then to seven. Hiroi was upset by the proposed cuts, so Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage and was told that one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=133}} Hiroi wrote the lyrics for all the songs, despite repeatedly protesting that he was not a professional lyricist.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> Because of his self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him.<ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter [[Y\u016b Aku]], and bought old records of vintage songs. It took between one and two months before Hiroi felt competent enough at writing song lyrics.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> ''Sakura Wars''{{'}} songs all began with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=126\u2013127}}\n\nTanaka composed the main theme, {{nihongo foot|\"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\"|\u6fc0!\u5e1d\u56fd\u83ef\u6483\u56e3|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}, based on Hiroi's instruction to combine the music of a ''[[Super Sentai]]'' opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film ''[[Aoi sanmyaku]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> The main theme was composed and approved in a very short time{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=138}} and Yokoyama sang it. Because of the structure of the song, and the variations in style and vocal strength it required, the recording sessions was a strenuous experience for her and required several takes.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=29\u201332}} One of Tanaka's favorite pieces to compose was the ending theme {{nihongo foot|\"Blooming Maidens\"|\u82b1\u54b2\u304f\u4e59\u5973|Hanasaku Otome|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}, which represented the strong will of the Imperial Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Yokoyama was the main vocalist, with backing and chorus work from the rest of the main female cast. The recording took an hour and proved to be an emotional experience for both singers and staff.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=20\u201326}} As the songs were completed very early in the game's development, the rest of the development staff were able to work with them and use them as references when creating other parts of the game and storyline.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=104\u2013105}}\n\nThe 1997 soundtrack album ''Sakura Wars Soundtrack: Steam Gramophone'' contains 51 tracks of music from ''Sakura Wars''.

New CGI segments were created and the anime cinematics were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/> The subtitle was taken from a [[tanka]] featured in ''[[Midaregami]]'', a collection of tanka by the famous Japanese writer and poet, [[Akiko Yosano]]. Hiroi enjoyed her work, so he featured quotes from her poems as subtitles for ''Sakura Wars'' titles several times after the first game's release.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/>\n\nThe number of graphics and artwork pieces was increased greatly, more recent and new LIPS functions were incorporated, and the Active and Real-time Machine System (ARMS) battle system introduced in later ''Sakura Wars'' titles was incorporated with new improvements including special attacks with accompanying short movies. Two additional story episodes were added. One expanded the story of one of the supporting characters, while the other connected to the next entry in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/> New voice acting was recorded for the characters, with the original actresses returning; these included Tomizawa, who had previously announced her retirement from the role in the early 2000s.

One contemporary review was in 2000 with ''[[GameFan]]'', which covered import games, and rated the Dreamcast port of the game highly.<ref name=\"GFreview\"/> Jake Alley of ''RPGamer'' was positive about the story and art design and its replay value but found the gameplay and aspects of its menu design lacking.<ref name=\"RPGamerReview\"/> ''RPGFan'' was highly positive about all aspects of the title, citing the artwork and voice acting as the main draw for players.<ref name=\"RPGFssReview\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Peter Bartholow, reviewing the Dreamcast port, also praised the game's visuals and story, while noting a lack of real gameplay and the low degree of difficulty.<ref name=\"GSsakura\"/>\n\n''Famitsu'' praised ''In Hot Blood'',  with reviewers noting that it was more like an entirely new game than a standard remake.<ref name=\"FamRemakeReview\"/> Chris Winkler of ''RPGFan'' praised the visual upgrade from earlier versions and the continued quality of the music and voice acting. He also positively noted the theme of the clash between Japan's Edo-era cultural isolation and the cosmopolitan attitude after the Meiji Restoration. He concluded the game \"can only be wholeheartedly recommended\" for both series veterans and newcomers.<ref name=\"RPGFps2Review\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nSeveral staff members were highly sceptical the game would be a commercial success, but Hiroi promised Sega that the game would sell at least 200,000 units.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} ''Sakura Wars'' sold out in many stores within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> According to ''Famitsu'' sales data, ''Sakura Wars'' sold an estimated 205,270 units in its first week, reaching the top of the sales charts<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and selling through just over 57% of its stocks.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/> It was recorded as having the most sales of a Sega original title to that point.<ref name=\"SakuraAbout\"/> As of 2007, ''Sakura Wars'' for the Saturn has sold 359,485 units, becoming the 13th best-selling console title in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/> The Dreamcast port debuted with 71,123 units, selling through nearly 65% of its shipment.

It spawned three direct sequels; ''[[Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die]]'' for the Saturn, and ''[[Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?]]'' and ''[[Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens]]'' for the Dreamcast.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVersions\"/><ref name=\"SakuraAbout\"/> A fourth sequel was developed for the [[PlayStation 2]]; known as ''Sakura Wars V: Farewell My Lovely'' in Japan, it was published overseas as  ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', becoming the first entry to release outside Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVersions\"/> Numerous spin-off titles covering multiple genres related to each entry have also been developed for multiple platforms.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSeriesIndex\"/>\n\n''Sakura Wars'' has remained popular in Japan since its release. It was rated as the 13th best game of all time in a 2006 ''Famitsu'' pole, with all the main entries then released also appearing in the list.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> Sakura herself was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/> In a poll published by ''Famitsu'', ''Sakura Wars'' and its first sequel were both ranked among the ten most memorable games for the Saturn, while the Dreamcast port of ''Sakura Wars'' was also ranked among the most memorable for that platform.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> Characters from ''Sakura Wars'', ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' were included as playable characters in the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] crossover title ''[[Project X Zone]]'' and its [[Project X Zone 2|2015 sequel]].<ref name=\"SakuraPXZa\"/><ref name=\"SakuraPXZb\"/>\n\n===Media adaptations===\nAn OVA series dubbed ''[[Sakura Wars: The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms]]'' was produced and released between 1997 and 1998. Created by [[Animate]] and [[Radix Ace Entertainment]], it told a series of stories around events mentioned in ''Sakura Wars'' as well as origin stories for the Flower Division members.<ref name=\"SakuraOVA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraOVAadv\"/> An [[Sakura Wars (TV series)|anime series of the same name]] was broadcast in 2000 over a six-month period.<ref name=\"SakuraWhats\"/> Co-produced by Red Company, [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and Studio Matrix, Ryutaro Nakamura directed the anime series. While following the basic plot of ''Sakura Wars'' and preserving Hiroi's original vision, several elements such as depictions of the main antagonist's past, Sakura's childhood memories and scenes within the Flower Division before Ogami's arrival were added. A major issue was being faithful to both the video game and OVAs while keeping within the restrictions of a television format.<ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanimeB\"/>\n\nA manga adaptation written by Hiroi and illustrated by Ikku Masa, with cover illustrations by Fujishima, began serialization in 2002. The first series ended in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second ongoing series the following year.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaB\"/> The first manga was originally serialized in ''[[Monthly Magazine Z]]'' until it closed down in 2008, shifting to other publications.

It is the first installment in the ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' series, created by [[Oji Hiroi]]. Originally released for the [[Sega Saturn]], it was later ported to other systems including the [[Dreamcast]] and remade for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Defined by Sega as a \"dramatic adventure\" game, ''Sakura Wars'' combines overlapping [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]], and [[visual novel]] gameplay elements.\n\nSet in a fictionalized version of 1923 in the [[Taish\u014d]] era, the game follows the exploits of the Imperial Combat Revue, a military unit dedicated to fighting supernatural threats against Tokyo while maintaining their cover as a theater troupe. [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Ensign Ichiro Ogami is assigned leader of its all-female Flower Division, a group of women with magical abilities that defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Koubus. He becomes embroiled in both the group's latest conflict with the Hive of Darkness and the personal lives of its members.\n\nHiroi created the concept for what would become ''Sakura Wars'' in 1990. In 1993, his small team in the Planning Department of Red Company began elaborating on his concept, with full development beginning the following year after being approved by Sega. Several prominent figures were brought on board the project including writer [[Satoru Akahori]], composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]], and character designer [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]]. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players have been able to play ''Sakura Wars'' due to an unofficial [[fan translation]] released in 2019. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest-selling titles for the Saturn, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the ''Sakura Wars'' series. A direct sequel, ''[[Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die]]'', was released in 1998.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| footer    = The two main gameplay modes of ''Sakura Wars'' are social interaction with characters using LIPS, and turn-based strategic battles directly influenced by LIPS interactions.\n\n| image1    = Sakura Wars 1 screenshot A.png\n| width1    = 100\n| alt1      =\n\n| image2    = Sakura Wars 1 screenshot B.png\n| width2    = 100\n| alt2      =\n}}\n''Sakura Wars'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which the player controls Ichiro Ogami and the all-female Flower Division of the Imperial Combat Revue, who must save Tokyo from the Hive of Darkness. Dubbed a \"dramatic adventure\" game and taking place across 10 episodes, the gameplay segments incorporate [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]], and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura1Overview\"/> It has two gameplay modes: an adventure mode and a battle mode. The adventure mode is divided between periods where Ogami navigates the Grand Imperial Theater and interacts with various characters, while the battle mode is governed by a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted grid-based battlefield.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=12}}{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=20}} Progress is saved at the end of each episode, and the player may also save the game during an [[Bumper (broadcasting)|eyecatch]].{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=8\u20139}}\n\nIn the adventure mode, Ogami navigates the theater during limited time sequences between battles. This game introduces the Live & Interactive Picture System (LIPS). When Ogami is faced with critical choices during conversations with both members of the Flower Division and supporting characters within the combat revue, dialogue trees are displayed with a time limit for the player to input. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting their relationship with Ogami and future interactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the cursor over parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=12\u201317}} Each main heroine has different personality quirks that must be taken into consideration while talking with them, with correct responses raising their \"Trust\".<ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/>{{sfn|Sega|1996|p=19}}\n\nIn the battle mode, the Flower Division fights demons using machines called Koubus. Each unit has its own turn, with each turn allowing two actions. These actions include \"Attack\", \"Defend\", \"Move\", \"Deathblow\" (a critical strike that can kill a normal enemy in one hit), Charge (store energy for a more powerful action during the next turn), and Heal (which restores [[Health (game terminology)|health points (HP)]] to a chosen unit). Different units specialize in different skills such as support actions, melee attacks, or ranged attacks.

Meanwhile, swordswoman Sakura Shinguji arrives from [[Sendai]] as the Assault Force's latest recruit and meets Ogami at [[Ueno Park]]. Traveling to the Grand Imperial Theater together, Ogami meets the team's main actresses: Sumire Kanzaki, Maria Tachibana, Iris Chateaubriand, Kanna Kirishima, and Kohran Ri. The theater's manager Ikki Yoneda tells Ogami he has been assigned as an usher. Initially bemused and hurt by his assignment, it turns out to be a bluff to decide his worth. The Imperial Combat Revue also functions as a theater troupe called the Imperial Revue. Central to the unit is the Flower Division, the Imperial Revue's main actresses, who use their spirit powers to defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Koubu.\n\nThe current wave of attacks is being controlled by the Hive of Darkness, a group of black magicians led by [[Tenkai]] and his powerful subordinates the Lords of Death. Tenkai's goal is to restore the shogunate and banish the growing Western influences from Japan, with the Hive of Darkness destroying magical seals around Tokyo that keep a powerful demonic horde at bay. As the Flower Division battles the Hive of Darkness, each member must confront their personal problems to function as an effective combat unit. Ogami also becomes involved in the running of the theater and is witness to on-stage incidents including Sakura bringing down the stage during one performance through her clumsiness, and Kanna and Sumire clashing on stage during another.\n\nThe Flower Division are unsuccessful in preventing the Hive of Darkness from destroying the seals, allowing Tenkai to summon a magical fortress from which he intends to conquer Japan. The Flower Division storm the fortress and destroy Tenkai and the fortress. During these events, Ogami becomes close to each member and can pursue a romantic relationship. The city recovers as the group relaxes, but a surviving Hive of Darkness member Kuroki Satan launches a fresh attack, renaming himself \"Aoi Satan\". He is actually Shinnosuke Yamazaki, a former comrade of Yoneda who was presumed killed with Sakura's father Kazuma when creating the original seals. Yamazaki survived and was possessed by the true [[Satan]], being responsible for controlling the demons and resurrecting Tenkai.\n\nYoneda's deputy, Ayame Fujieda, is turned into a demon using her suppressed feelings for Ogami. Satan summons a great fortress called the Seima Castle from the sea near Tokyo, intent on releasing the population of Hell to overrun humanity. Using the airship ''Mikasa'', the Imperial Combat Revue launch a concentrated attack on the castle. They successfully unite their spiritual power to banish Satan back to Hell. Ayame's demon form is destroyed at the cost of her life, and after bidding farewell she ascends to Heaven as an angel named Michael. After Aoi Satan's defeat, the final scene varies depending on whether Ogami romanced a member of the Flower Division and which member he chose.\n\n==Production==\n===Concept and development===\n[[Oji Hiroi]] created the concept for what would become ''Sakura Wars'' in 1990. He saw a Japanese stage production of the play ''Shanghai Rhapsody'' and was impressed by the spectacle of the acting troop he saw on stage.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/> In 1993, Hiroi and anime composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] worked together on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) adaptation of the video game ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''.<ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/> Hiroi was highly impressed by Tanaka's music, to the point where he wanted him to create a musical set to it. This concept evolved into his wish for Tanaka to score a video game focused on the theater.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Later in 1993, a small team in the Planning Department of Red Company (now [[Red Entertainment]]) led by Hiroi began promoting his concept and planning the game's basic concepts. At this stage, the project was titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}} to connect it with Japan. It was described as an \"example plan\" rather than a practical project. While distinct from the final ''Sakura Wars'' the proposal shared an alternate historical setting with [[steampunk]] technology, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> In addition to Hiroi, the team included Ryoma Kaneko and Naoki Morita, who would later work on ''Sakura Wars'' proper.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} While developing the \"''Sakura''\" proposal, Hiroi and his team created two [[tabletop role-playing game]]s dubbed \"''Sakura 1''\" and \"''Sakura 2''\". This resulted in the strategy elements almost overriding the game's other aspects.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/> Inspired by the combination of tactical combat and the story used in the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, Hiroi steered the project more in that direction. Influences from contemporary anime were also added to bring depth to the story and characters. With the basic elements defined, the team continued refining the project for between half a year and a year. Convinced of the project's potential to become a video game, Hiroi presented \"''Sakura''\" to multiple game companies, but none of them had confidence in the project. Despite his determination to see the project realized, Hiroi put the project aside with no expectation that it would be produced.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=123}}\n\nIn 1994, following Hiroi's decision to put ''Sakura'' aside, [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]]\u2014then vice president of [[Sega]]\u2014contacted him about the possibility of developing a game with a popular mascot character for Sega's in-development [[Sega Saturn]] [[home console]]. Irimajiri wanted a unique video game property for the system and had heard positive feedback about Hiroi's work. Hiroi was initially reluctant but eventually accepted Irimajiri's offer, inviting him and other potential contributors to spend a fortnight's holiday in [[Saipan]].{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> Hiroi later said the decision to work on a game for the Saturn was a hard one, as he had previously worked on games for rival unspecified home console systems. It was Sega's favorable response to his pitch that persuaded him to develop ''Sakura Wars'' on the Saturn.<ref name=\"SakuraDorimanga\"/> Hiroi pitched his old concept for ''Sakura'' to Irimajiri during their stay on Saipan. While Hiroi harbored doubts as to whether such an ambitious and unusual project would be accepted, Irimajiri was convinced. On their return to Japan, Sega and Red Company began development on Hiroi's project.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/>{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=64, 74}} That October, it was given the title ''Sakura Wars'' as there were problems trademarking the ''kanji'' version of ''Sakura'' because it is the native name for [[cherry blossom]]. The word \"''Sakura''\" was written in [[katakana]] instead.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTrademark\"/>\n\nThe inclusion of adventure segments alongside the strategic simulation elements was contentious early on, with some fearing ''Sakura Wars'' would turn into a [[bish\u014djo game]].{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}} The strategic segments were designed to feel like interactive anime battles, with everyone getting a chance to attack as in many anime fight sequences of the time. The wish for an anime style also came through in the adventure segments with LIPS, turning conversations into a kind of confrontation to be won.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}} LIPS was born out of staff frustration with the adventure game tradition of time freezing while the player decided which response to select in a tense situation. By implementing a time limit, the team made ''Sakura Wars'' more interactive and removed this frustration. The \"LIPS\" name was chosen for its distinct sound rather than any special meaning.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} Full development of LIPS began after running a test using a scene where Ogami could choose whether to look inside a shower cubicle.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The battle sequences were inspired by similar scenes found in the ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' and ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' television shows. The two shows' violence was actively referenced during the last battle with the combined final attack of the entire Flower Division. Each battle sequence was hand-crafted by one member of staff to simplify production.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=114}} The game's \"Trust\" system was a means of incorporating simulation elements without utilizing role-playing elements such as experience points. The decision to remove experience points entirely proved controversial within the team.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=341}} According to director Tomoyuki Ito, the process of creating \"Trust\" and associated systems was based on trial and error, mainly around how best to express it.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}}\n\nDevelopment of ''Sakura Wars'' lasted for approximately three years\u2014double the original estimate.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} Hiroi acted as the general producer,<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> while Ito acted as a director.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}} Buildup Entertainment and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]] developed the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) segments,<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/> and the anime cinematics were directed by Shunji Oga and produced by Sega-owned studio Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (later [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> Sega initially outsourced programming to an unnamed external company. By 1995 it had already developed one or two chapters of the game's combat-based content before Hiroi objected to the direction the game was taking. It was becoming a generic simulation game that deviated from his vision. Red Company refused to continue development of the prototype, and it was removed from development. Sega's [[Sega AM1#Overworks|CS Research & Development No. 2]] (CS2 R&D) division desired the game's completion, so they co-developed it with Red Company.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The conflicting gameplay elements needed to be divided between different teams within CS2 R&D, only bringing the two parts together at the end of development.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=114}} Because of this development technique, none of the elements could be effectively tested until the game was close to completion.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=334}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128}} As a result of these difficulties, the Sega team found production difficult.<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Sega stated that ''Sakura Wars'' was their most expensive video game production to date, although no exact budget was given.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/>\n\n===Art design===\n[[File:Teikoku Kagekidan Team.jpg|thumb|right|The main cast of ''Sakura Wars'' as portrayed in later [[original video animation]] adaptations. Each character was designed around a particular theme, with battle outfits modelled on [[tuxedo]]s.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102\u2013103}}<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>]]\nManga artist [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]], who at the time was working on the long-running manga series ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]'', designed the main cast.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} His editors resisted letting him do the designs due to his heavy workload, including his commitment to ''Oh My Goddess!''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' was the first time Fujishima had worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property. He was skeptical of the project because of the state it was in when he was first approached. It was in a very early stage of development and neither the story nor gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place at a time when it was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant he would be the character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project in late 1994. His first design was for Sakura.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=89-90}} The first sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right designer.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=89-90}}{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=342}} The positive reception to Fujishima's work, together with his understanding of the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>\n\nFujishima was responsible for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} [[Hidenori Matsubara]] designed the supporting cast and helped with general animation.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=128\u2013131}} Fujishima found it easy to design the characters as their concepts had been firmly established before he created the first drafts and moved on to the final designs. The designs were meant to communicate the characters' inner thoughts and had to be understandable for players. Due to the game's Taish\u014d period setting, he needed to stop himself adding anachronistic elements like [[fastener]]s.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/> Hiroi made detailed character sheets for Fujishima to use when designing the cast. An example was Sumire, whose personality was communicated through her clothes.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/>{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=4}} Each character had distinct traits, such as a ponytail and [[hakama]] kimono for Sakura. Fujishima combined these elements with his own design ideas for the final artwork.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=319}} The Taish\u014d period meant he could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=4}} His design for each main protagonist\u2014from Ogami to the Flower Division members\u2014directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them.{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=14\u201325}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=132}} The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after the [[tuxedo]], and Fujishima compared them with the costumes of the [[Takarazuka Revue]].<ref name=\"SSMbattlesuits\"/>{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=79}}\n\nFutoshi Nagata created the Koubu mecha designs, along with the game's CGI sequences.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}<ref name=\"SSMinterviewKoubu\"/> His initial design outline from Hiroi was the basic concept of using steampunk technology within the Taish\u014d period.<ref name=\"SakuraRomanticGraph\"/> When designing the Koubu, Nagata was guided by Morita, who showed him photographs of both steam-powered trains and early deep-sea [[diving suit]]s\u2014specifically those made of spherical segments. Nagata did extensive research on the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and consciously avoided the trope of anachronistic near-future technology while creating the designs.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}<ref name=\"Sakura2info\"/> The concept of a diving suit was integrated into the concept for the Koubu being reinforced armor rather than robots. Its front was designed after the steam trains that ran on the Aji Express Line.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewKoubu\"/> For each Flower Division member's Koubu armor, Nagata designed them to mirror their traits and beauty so they would be unique. Since the Koubu were meant to be armor, they were not given faces.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}} Because Nagata was brought on early in the game's production, he had considerable freedom when submitting and adjusting his designs.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=123\u2013124}} When the designs were finalized, Nagata began working full-time on CGI, finishing the first Koubu model in five days.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=108}}\n\n===Scenario and characters===\nWhen Hiroi was creating the original concept for ''Sakura Wars'', he had trouble picking the exact era in which the story would take place. He initially considered using the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], with a focus on the post-war [[black market]].<ref name=\"SakuraGemaga\"/> He also considered setting it shortly before and during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Mainichi\"/> Hiroi eventually abandoned this idea as there was too much documentation about the Sh\u014dwa period making its use as a fantasy setting complicated.<ref name=\"SakuraGemaga\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> He next considered using the [[Meiji period]], which was a time of turbulence after the fall of the isolationist Tokugawa Shogunate that saw Western Culture introduced into Japan. Hiroi also abandoned this idea as Meiji-era Japan could not allow for the \"modern\" feeling he wanted.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> With this in mind, Hiroi settled on using the Taish\u014d period as the setting for ''Sakura Wars''. The Taish\u014d period involved Japan integrating Western culture into its own, allowing for political changes and the emancipation of women after a prolonged feudal period.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/><ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanime\"/> In the original draft, the story was much darker, with a key event being the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] and the resultant breakdown of the Taish\u014d period. This version was almost entirely discarded.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=28}}\n\nHiroi wanted to create a version of the Taish\u014d period where the social advances and freedoms the Japanese began exploring continued without being brought to an end by the Great Kant\u014d earthquake and the subsequent shift to militarism before World War II.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview4\"/> Another reason for using the Taish\u014d period was the lack of documentation about it and Tokyo's development because the Great Kant\u014d earthquake destroyed much of it.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSetting\"/> Originally Hiroi wanted to distinguish the ''Sakura Wars'' Taish\u014d from the historical Taish\u014d by modifying the kanji slightly. He did not do this because his staff wanted a world that blended real and fictional events.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=209}} To further distinguish it, Hiroi made use of steampunk technology in the game's world.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/> Despite it being a fantastic version of the Taish\u014d period, Hiroi did his best to incorporate realistic elements.<ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> The world's general setting, while conceived by Hiroi, was further developed and fleshed out by Kaneko and Morita.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}}\n\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Satoru Akahori]] wrote the main script and branching storylines.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}} Hiroi felt the script would lose entertainment value if he wrote it himself as the setting was based on family stories.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/> He had previously worked with Akahori on other projects. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi he was highly skeptical, but Hiroi convinced him to come on board.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} When he was first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and [[mecha]].<ref name=\"SakuraCartoon\"/> Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game. Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television series.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still unfinished. The only points that had been finalized were its setting, the overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft.<ref name=\"NewtypeAkahori\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=129}} Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself and needed to consult frequently with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=68\u201369}} Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102}} Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, and worked on script editing and debugging.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=112\u2013113}}\n\nCreating strong representative characters was part of Sega's request for a new mascot character for their Saturn system.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=316}}{{sfn|Ikusha|2006|p=88}}<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> A major element of the cast was taking advantage of the game's setting. It could allow for characters from countries outside Japan\u2014like Russia and France\u2014to be part of the Imperial Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/> During early planning, Hiroi produced character concepts for the Flower Division, imitating [[Glossary of anime and manga#Character traits|character archetypes]] commonly found in high school manga. Using this inspiration, he created a gentle yet strong-willed woman (Sakura), a rival character with a negative first impression (Sumire), a cold leader figure (Maria), a small cute character who would be jealous of the other members (Iris), a woman who would be good at athletics (Kanna) and an oddball character who wore glasses (Kohran).{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102\u2013103}} The role of the male protagonist was given initially to a young man named Kusaku Kanuma, a member of the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] who inherits a blade forged by the Japanese swordsmith [[Muramasa]] and must work with Sakura to pilot a two-person [[Mecha|mech]]. As with most of the draft scenario, the male character underwent major alterations.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=28\u201331}} Most of the protagonist's development into Ichiro Ogami happened after Akahori joined the team. He created Ogami's role as an avatar for the player who could be friends with every member of the Flower Division. The Japanese word for \"wolf\" {{Nihongo|\"''Okami''\"|\u72fc|}}, referring to his energetic personality traits, inspired his name.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=102}}{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=135}}\n\n===Audio===\n====Casting====\nWhen casting actors to voice the game's characters, Hiroi needed people who could both act and sing the musical numbers.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> To this end, he required potential voice actors to have experience with live stage performance and be able to sing.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=125}} Hiroi personally approached each of the voice actresses who played members of the Imperial Combat Revue based on their acting and singing abilities before they were pitched the concept of ''Sakura Wars''. Staff members recommended several actresses to Hiroi.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> Bringing together the voice cast for a video game at such an early stage was unheard of at the time. Because of this, the cast recorded their lines and songs as the game was developed.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=15}}\n\n*[[Chisa Yokoyama]] voiced Sakura. Hiroi chose Yokoyama, who had appeared in notable anime series including ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', based on his wish to create a compelling final deathblow line.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> She was originally cast in the role of Iris but was recast in the role of Sakura after Iris' final voice actress was cast.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=126}} Yokoyama was used to recording strong characters, so portraying Sakura as a \"normal\" girl made the role difficult for her to perform.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=116}}\n*[[Urara Takano]] voiced Maria. Hiroi offered her the role because of her positive working experiences with Yokoyama.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=165}} Takano was performing in a concert when Hiroi first approached her. Although the project was in the early stages of development, she was intrigued by Maria's character and agreed to take the role.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=352}}\n*[[Michie Tomizawa]] voiced Sumire. Hiroi first approached her in late 1994 during a Christmas concert on the recommendation of a mutual friend. Hiroi pitched his concept for Sumire, and after seeing Tomizawa's performance offered her the role.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=350}}\n*[[Mayumi Tanaka]] voiced Kanna. Hiroi selected her for the role based on her experience performing the comedic \"handsome man\" archetype in [[kabuki]] stage performances.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=376}} Tanaka was instructed to play Kanna as a tomboyish character unconcerned by her true gender.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=359}}\n*[[Yuriko Fuchizaki]] voiced Kohran. Fujishima recommended her to Hiroi. She was approached in mid-1995 when recording was being planned for the opening and ending themes, and questions were still being asked by the cast about how to portray the characters.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=356}}\n*[[Kumiko Nishihara]] voiced Iris. After hearing Nishihara's performance as Sakura, Yokoyama, who was originally given the role of Iris, suggested they switch roles and Nishihara became Iris' voice actress.{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=126}}\n*[[Ai Orikasa]] voiced Ayame. She was planning a fan club concert when Hiroi approached her about ''Sakura Wars'' on Yokoyama's recommendation. After seeing Ayame's performance, Hiroi offered her the role.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=193}} While recording her part, Orikasa encountered difficulties portraying the three different versions of Ayame's character.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=40\u201341}}\n*[[Akio Suyama]] voiced Ogami. At the time, Suyama had little to no voice acting experience and was working part-time at Red Company while training as a voice actor.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=205}} Hiroi was still looking for a voice actor for Ogami but had a limited budget. On hearing of Hiroi's situation, Suyama offered to take on the role, despite there being only a few notable lines. Faced with his budget and time limitations, Hiroi accepted his offer.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> Ogami was the last main character to be cast.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>\n\nOnce selected, Hiroi and Tanaka gathered the cast and told them about the project. They were given pictures of their respective characters.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=14}} The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato. He followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/>{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=65\u201366}} Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and told they were just one-third of the script.<ref name=\"Sakura2setting\"/> Sato told the cast voices would be the characters' main emotive force, as the faces of character portraits would be mostly static.{{sfn|SoftBank|2002|p=205}} Sakura was the last character to be recorded so Sato could focus on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=46}}\n\n====Music====\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Sakura Wars Soundtrack: Steam Gramophone\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          =\n| released     = May 2, 1997\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       = 21:25 (disc one)<br/>74:30 (disc two)\n| label        = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Japan]]/Lipop Record\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nThe score for ''Sakura Wars'' was [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]]'s first successful video game music composition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> He was among the first people to offer support for Hiroi's vision, as few people believed the project would come to fruition.<ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> Tanaka was also among the first brought on board for production and served as a teacher figure to the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> In a later interview, he stated that he felt like his composing career was at risk while supporting the game.<ref name=\"SilInfoTanaka\"/> When he began composing the score in 1995, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> While thinking about how he could construct the music, Tanaka looked at popular music from the game's time period and worked to re-create its melodies and structure using the popular music styles of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Sakura2Song\"/> Because of the setting and Tanaka's goals, he was able to incorporate multiple music genres including jazz, rumba, and samba alongside more traditional Japanese musical styles.<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/>\n\nTanaka initially planned 50 songs, but this was too many to record and fit into the game within the allotted time and budget. The number was reduced to 24, then to seven. Hiroi was upset by the proposed cuts, so Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage and was told that one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/>{{sfn|Enterbrain|2011|p=133}} Hiroi wrote the lyrics for all the songs, despite repeatedly protesting that he was not a professional lyricist.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/> Because of his self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him.<ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter [[Y\u016b Aku]], and bought old records of vintage songs. It took between one and two months before Hiroi felt competent enough at writing song lyrics.<ref name=\"Sakura2Pachinko\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> ''Sakura Wars''{{'}} songs all began with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=126\u2013127}}\n\nTanaka composed the main theme, {{nihongo foot|\"Geki!

Because of the structure of the song, and the variations in style and vocal strength it required, the recording sessions was a strenuous experience for her and required several takes.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=29\u201332}} One of Tanaka's favorite pieces to compose was the ending theme {{nihongo foot|\"Blooming Maidens\"|\u82b1\u54b2\u304f\u4e59\u5973|Hanasaku Otome|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}, which represented the strong will of the Imperial Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Yokoyama was the main vocalist, with backing and chorus work from the rest of the main female cast. The recording took an hour and proved to be an emotional experience for both singers and staff.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=20\u201326}} As the songs were completed very early in the game's development, the rest of the development staff were able to work with them and use them as references when creating other parts of the game and storyline.{{sfn|SoftBank|1996|p=104\u2013105}}\n\nThe 1997 soundtrack album ''Sakura Wars Soundtrack: Steam Gramophone'' contains 51 tracks of music from ''Sakura Wars''. It was published by BMG Japan.<ref name=\"RPGFOSTReview\"/> In addition to the original soundtrack album, a vocal collection was published by BMG Japan in 1996.<ref name=\"RPGFSongReview\"/> Music for the 2003 remake was also composed by Tanaka. The soundtrack for the 2003 remake was released by Avex Mode as an album, titled ''Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood Teigeki Complete Music Collection'', shortly after the game's release in February 2003.<ref name=\"VGMOInHotBlood\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Sakura Wars'' was first announced at a special Sega presentation in 1995 for release in April 1996.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/> The game's unique blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labelled as a new genre dubbed \"dramatic adventure\" in its marketing.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> Because of the greatly increased amount of content\u2014particularly the amount of voice acting Hiroi wanted to include\u2014the release date was delayed several months at his insistence, and the game was expanded from a single disc to a two-disc release.{{sfn|SoftBank|1999|p=60}} In order to meet the new release date, the developers worked long hours and sometimes through the night.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> Several pieces of finished content needed to be cut to make the release date.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' was released on September 27, 1996.

New CGI segments were created and the anime cinematics were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/> The subtitle was taken from a [[tanka]] featured in ''[[Midaregami]]'', a collection of tanka by the famous Japanese writer and poet, [[Akiko Yosano]]. Hiroi enjoyed her work, so he featured quotes from her poems as subtitles for ''Sakura Wars'' titles several times after the first game's release.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/>\n\nThe number of graphics and artwork pieces was increased greatly, more recent and new LIPS functions were incorporated, and the Active and Real-time Machine System (ARMS) battle system introduced in later ''Sakura Wars'' titles was incorporated with new improvements including special attacks with accompanying short movies. Two additional story episodes were added. One expanded the story of one of the supporting characters, while the other connected to the next entry in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/> New voice acting was recorded for the characters, with the original actresses returning; these included Tomizawa, who had previously announced her retirement from the role in the early 2000s.

He also positively noted the theme of the clash between Japan's Edo-era cultural isolation and the cosmopolitan attitude after the Meiji Restoration. He concluded the game \"can only be wholeheartedly recommended\" for both series veterans and newcomers.<ref name=\"RPGFps2Review\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nSeveral staff members were highly sceptical the game would be a commercial success, but Hiroi promised Sega that the game would sell at least 200,000 units.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} ''Sakura Wars'' sold out in many stores within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> According to ''Famitsu'' sales data, ''Sakura Wars'' sold an estimated 205,270 units in its first week, reaching the top of the sales charts<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and selling through just over 57% of its stocks.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/> It was recorded as having the most sales of a Sega original title to that point.<ref name=\"SakuraAbout\"/> As of 2007, ''Sakura Wars'' for the Saturn has sold 359,485 units, becoming the 13th best-selling console title in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/> The Dreamcast port debuted with 71,123 units, selling through nearly 65% of its shipment.

It spawned three direct sequels; ''[[Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die]]'' for the Saturn, and ''[[Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?]]'' and ''[[Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens]]'' for the Dreamcast.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVersions\"/><ref name=\"SakuraAbout\"/> A fourth sequel was developed for the [[PlayStation 2]]; known as ''Sakura Wars V: Farewell My Lovely'' in Japan, it was published overseas as  ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', becoming the first entry to release outside Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVersions\"/> Numerous spin-off titles covering multiple genres related to each entry have also been developed for multiple platforms.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSeriesIndex\"/>\n\n''Sakura Wars'' has remained popular in Japan since its release. It was rated as the 13th best game of all time in a 2006 ''Famitsu'' pole, with all the main entries then released also appearing in the list.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> Sakura herself was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/> In a poll published by ''Famitsu'', ''Sakura Wars'' and its first sequel were both ranked among the ten most memorable games for the Saturn, while the Dreamcast port of ''Sakura Wars'' was also ranked among the most memorable for that platform.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> Characters from ''Sakura Wars'', ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' were included as playable characters in the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] crossover title ''[[Project X Zone]]'' and its [[Project X Zone 2|2015 sequel]].<ref name=\"SakuraPXZa\"/><ref name=\"SakuraPXZb\"/>\n\n===Media adaptations===\nAn OVA series dubbed ''[[Sakura Wars: The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms]]'' was produced and released between 1997 and 1998.

While following the basic plot of ''Sakura Wars'' and preserving Hiroi's original vision, several elements such as depictions of the main antagonist's past, Sakura's childhood memories and scenes within the Flower Division before Ogami's arrival were added. A major issue was being faithful to both the video game and OVAs while keeping within the restrictions of a television format.<ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanimeB\"/>\n\nA manga adaptation written by Hiroi and illustrated by Ikku Masa, with cover illustrations by Fujishima, began serialization in 2002. The first series ended in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second ongoing series the following year.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaB\"/> The first manga was originally serialized in ''[[Monthly Magazine Z]]'' until it closed down in 2008, shifting to other publications.

Thigmotropism is typically found in [[Vines|twining plants]] and tendrils, however plant biologists have also found thigmotropic responses in flowering plants and fungi. This behavior occurs due to unilateral growth inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mordecai|first=Jaffe|date=March 2002|title=Thigmo Responses in Plants and Fungi|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/066a3a8fdbbedc9789b3d5aaffa1cd9dac07fce6|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|issue=3|pages=375\u2013382|doi=10.3732/ajb.89.3.375|pmid=21665632}}</ref> That is, the growth rate on the side of the stem which is being touched is slower than on the side opposite the touch. The resultant growth pattern is to attach and sometimes curl around the object which is touching the plant. However, flowering plants have also been observed to move or grow their sex organs toward a pollinator that lands on the flower, as in ''[[Portulaca grandiflora]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scorza|first=Livia Camilla Trevisan|last2=Dornelas|first2=Marcelo Carnier|date=2011-12-01|title=Plants on the move|journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior|volume=6|issue=12|pages=1979\u20131986|doi=10.4161/psb.6.12.18192|issn=1559-2316|pmc=3337191|pmid=22231201}}</ref>\n\n== Physiological factors ==\nSince growth is a complex developmental procedure, there are indeed many requirements (both biotic and abiotic) that are needed for both touch perception and a thigmotropic response to occur. One of these is calcium. In a series of experiments in 1995 using the tendril ''[[Bryonia dioica]]'', touch-sensing [[calcium channels]] were blocked using various antagonists. Responses to touch in treatment plants which received calcium channel inhibitors were diminished compared to control plants, indicating that calcium may be required for thigmotropism. Later in 2001, a membrane depolarization pathway was proposed in which calcium was involved: when a touch occurs, calcium channels open and calcium flows into the cell, shifting the electrochemical potential across the membrane. This triggers voltage-gated chloride and potassium channels to open and leads to an action potential that signals the perception of touch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fasano|first=Jeremiah M.|last2=Massa|first2=Gioia D.|last3=Gilroy|first3=Simon|date=2002-06-01|title=Ionic Signaling in Plant Responses to Gravity and Touch|journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=71\u201388|doi=10.1007/s003440010049|pmid=12016507|issn=0721-7595}}</ref>\n\nThe plant growth hormone [[auxin]] has also been observed to be involved in thigmotropic behavior in plants, but its role is not well understood. Instead of asymmetric auxin distribution influencing other tropisms, it has been shown that a unidirectional thigmotropic response can occur even with a symmetric distribution of auxin. It has been proposed that the action potential arising from a touch stimulus leads to an increase of auxin in the cell, which causes the production of an contractile protein on the side of the touch that allows the plant to grip onto an object.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=Leonora|date=1967-11-10|title=Induction of Coiling in Tendrils by Auxin and Carbon Dioxide|journal=Science|language=en|volume=158|issue=3802|pages=791\u2013793|doi=10.1126/science.158.3802.791|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6048120}}</ref> Further, it has been shown that when auxin (typically leading to growth ''away'' from the side of its localization) and a touch stimulus (causing a tropic response ''toward'' its localization) were applied on the same side of a cucumber hypocotyl, the stem will curve towards the touch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hideyuki|last2=Jaffe|first2=Mordecai J.|date=1990-12-01|title=Thigmotropism and the modulation of tropistic curvature by mechanical perturbation in cucumber hypocotyls|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=561\u2013567|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05679.x|issn=1399-3054}}</ref>\n\n[[Ethylene]], another plant hormone, has also been shown to be an important regulator to the thigmotropic response in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' roots. Under normal circumstances, high ethylene concentrations in the roots promote straight growth. When the root encounters a rigid object, the thigmotropic response is activated and ethylene production is down-regulated, leading to the root to bend while growing rather than growing straight.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Chigusa|last2=Sakata|first2=Yoichi|last3=Taji|first3=Teruaki|last4=Baba|first4=Tadashi|last5=Tanaka|first5=Shigeo|date=2008-07-18|title=Unique ethylene-regulated touch responses of Arabidopsis thaliana roots to physical hardness|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10265-008-0178-4|journal=Journal of Plant Research|language=en|volume=121|issue=5|pages=509|doi=10.1007/s10265-008-0178-4|issn=1618-0860}}</ref>\n\nLike phototropism, a thigmotropic response in stems requires light. Plant biologist Mark Jaffe performed a simple preliminary experiment using pea plants that led to this conclusion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses|last=Chamovitz|first=Daniel|publisher=Scientific American|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=114}}</ref> He found that when he snipped a tendril off of a pea plant and placed it in the light, then repeatedly touched one side of it, the tendril would begin to curl. However, when performing this same experiment in the dark, the tendril would not curl.\n\n== In roots ==\n[[Root]]s also rely on touch to navigate their way through the soil. Generally, roots have a negative touch response, meaning when they feel an object, they would grow away from the object. This allows the roots to go through the soil with minimum resistance. Because of this behavior, roots are said to be negatively thigmotropic. Thigmotropism seems to be able to override the strong [[gravitropic]] response of even primary roots. [[Charles Darwin]] performed experiments where he found that in a vertical bean root, a contact stimulus could divert the root away from the vertical.\n\n==Misconception==\n''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' is well known for its [[rapid plant movement]]. The leaves close up and droop when touched. However, this is not a form of [[tropism]], but a [[nastic movement]], a similar phenomenon.

This behavior occurs due to unilateral growth inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mordecai|first=Jaffe|date=March 2002|title=Thigmo Responses in Plants and Fungi|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/066a3a8fdbbedc9789b3d5aaffa1cd9dac07fce6|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|issue=3|pages=375\u2013382|doi=10.3732/ajb.89.3.375|pmid=21665632}}</ref> That is, the growth rate on the side of the stem which is being touched is slower than on the side opposite the touch. The resultant growth pattern is to attach and sometimes curl around the object which is touching the plant. However, flowering plants have also been observed to move or grow their sex organs toward a pollinator that lands on the flower, as in ''[[Portulaca grandiflora]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scorza|first=Livia Camilla Trevisan|last2=Dornelas|first2=Marcelo Carnier|date=2011-12-01|title=Plants on the move|journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior|volume=6|issue=12|pages=1979\u20131986|doi=10.4161/psb.6.12.18192|issn=1559-2316|pmc=3337191|pmid=22231201}}</ref>\n\n== Physiological factors ==\nSince growth is a complex developmental procedure, there are indeed many requirements (both biotic and abiotic) that are needed for both touch perception and a thigmotropic response to occur. One of these is calcium. In a series of experiments in 1995 using the tendril ''[[Bryonia dioica]]'', touch-sensing [[calcium channels]] were blocked using various antagonists. Responses to touch in treatment plants which received calcium channel inhibitors were diminished compared to control plants, indicating that calcium may be required for thigmotropism. Later in 2001, a membrane depolarization pathway was proposed in which calcium was involved: when a touch occurs, calcium channels open and calcium flows into the cell, shifting the electrochemical potential across the membrane. This triggers voltage-gated chloride and potassium channels to open and leads to an action potential that signals the perception of touch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fasano|first=Jeremiah M.|last2=Massa|first2=Gioia D.|last3=Gilroy|first3=Simon|date=2002-06-01|title=Ionic Signaling in Plant Responses to Gravity and Touch|journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=71\u201388|doi=10.1007/s003440010049|pmid=12016507|issn=0721-7595}}</ref>\n\nThe plant growth hormone [[auxin]] has also been observed to be involved in thigmotropic behavior in plants, but its role is not well understood. Instead of asymmetric auxin distribution influencing other tropisms, it has been shown that a unidirectional thigmotropic response can occur even with a symmetric distribution of auxin. It has been proposed that the action potential arising from a touch stimulus leads to an increase of auxin in the cell, which causes the production of an contractile protein on the side of the touch that allows the plant to grip onto an object.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=Leonora|date=1967-11-10|title=Induction of Coiling in Tendrils by Auxin and Carbon Dioxide|journal=Science|language=en|volume=158|issue=3802|pages=791\u2013793|doi=10.1126/science.158.3802.791|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6048120}}</ref> Further, it has been shown that when auxin (typically leading to growth ''away'' from the side of its localization) and a touch stimulus (causing a tropic response ''toward'' its localization) were applied on the same side of a cucumber hypocotyl, the stem will curve towards the touch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hideyuki|last2=Jaffe|first2=Mordecai J.|date=1990-12-01|title=Thigmotropism and the modulation of tropistic curvature by mechanical perturbation in cucumber hypocotyls|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=561\u2013567|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05679.x|issn=1399-3054}}</ref>\n\nLike phototropism, a thigmotropic response in stems requires light. Plant biologist Mark Jaffe performed a simple preliminary experiment using pea plants that led to this conclusion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses|last=Chamovitz|first=Daniel|publisher=Scientific American|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=114}}</ref> He found that when he snipped a tendril off of a pea plant and placed it in the light, then repeatedly touched one side of it, the tendril would begin to curl. However, when performing this same experiment in the dark, the tendril would not curl.\n\n== In roots ==\n[[Root]]s also rely on touch to navigate their way through the soil. Generally, roots have a negative touch response, meaning when they feel an object, they would grow away from the object. This allows the roots to go through the soil with minimum resistance. Because of this behavior, roots are said to be negatively thigmotropic. Thigmotropism seems to be able to override the strong [[gravitropic]] response of even primary roots. [[Charles Darwin]] performed experiments where he found that in a vertical bean root, a contact stimulus could divert the root away from the vertical.\n\n==Misconception==\n''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' is well known for its [[rapid plant movement]]. The leaves close up and droop when touched. However, this is not a form of [[tropism]], but a [[nastic movement]], a similar phenomenon. [[Nastic movements]] are non-directional responses to stimuli (e.g. temperature, humidity, light irradiance), and are usually associated with plants.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://biology.kenyon.edu/edwards/project/steffan/b45sv.htm Thigmotropism in Tendrils]\n\n{{Tropism}}\n\n[[Category:Tropism]]\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]\n[[Category:Auxin action]]\n", "name_user": "R.hirtellum", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhysiological factors:I've added some sentences regarding ethylene's role in thigmotropism in roots.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigmotropism"}

The school serves grades 9 through 12 and is one of four High Schools in [[Columbia Public Schools]]. It is located next to the Columbia Career Center. The mascot is the Bruin Bear.\n\n==History==\nDue to the increasing population of Columbia in the 1970s, and the crowding of [[David H. Hickman High School]] towards the end of the 1960s, the Columbia Board of Education decided to form a new high school. The board bought {{convert|42|acre|m2}} of land in southern Columbia and started the construction of the new high school. The name \"Rock Bridge\" was chosen because of the school's proximity to the natural rock bridge of [[Rock Bridge State Park]].\n\nConstruction started in 1969 on the original portion of the building, consisting of 18 classrooms and one office area in the present-day east wing of the building. Many of these classrooms were connected by motorized folding walls, many of which are still operational and in use. The school was planned to open in 1971, but funding issues pushed back construction of the second phase of the building. As such, this original portion sat unused for a year or two while the second portion was not yet complete.\n\nConstruction started on the second portion in early 1972, which added the \"Main Commons\", another office area, the library, the gymnasium, and a few specialty classrooms underneath that area. In September 1973, with the completion of the second portion, Rock Bridge was considered \"complete enough\" to open and had a class of 583 students, mostly sophomores and juniors. This high school was the second centrally air conditioned school built in Columbia after Oakland Junior High School north of town. In 1974, the planetarium was completed with a capacity of nearly 90 people, featuring a state-of-the-art star ball and a full-dome projection system .\n\nIn 1979, the west wing opened, which was basically a mirror image of the original 1971 building but with a finished basement. The west wing featured about ten general-purpose classrooms, as well as science, art, and band rooms, providing the school with a then-total of about 40 classrooms.  Three new science classrooms, as well as a performing arts center, were added in 1992. Enrollment reached 1000 in the 1995\u201396 school year.\n\nIn 2000, a large addition opened between the east and west wings, featuring seven science classrooms, eight English and social studies classrooms, seven foreign language classrooms, a new media center and three new computer labs. In January 2013 Rock Bridge opened a new auxiliary gym after freshmen began attending high school following the secondary redistricting in August. The area under the auxiliary gym featured a new wrestling room, making room for three new math classrooms in the former location. A new weight room was also added.\n\n==Structure==\nRock Bridge runs on a [[block scheduling]] format during the hours of 8:55&nbsp;am to 4:05&nbsp;pm. This format is structured so that students have four 90-minute-long classes each day. However, most of these classes meet every other day for a total of eight classes for the year. Unique to Rock Bridge is AUT, a free period for sophomores and upperclassmen allowing them to go anywhere within their 90-minute period. (Block scheduling was established in the 1994\u201395 school year.<ref>http://cpsk12.schoolwires.net/domain/5242</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nThe school offers 18 Advanced Placement courses and a multitude of honors classes available to students. However, RBHS does not weight grade point averages.\n\n==Athletics==\nRock Bridge High offers a variety of sports.  Fall sports include cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis and volleyball.  Rock Bridge has won Football State Championships with undefeated teams in 1975 and 1977.  Winter sports include basketball and wrestling.  Spring sports include baseball and track and field. Year-round sports include cheerleading and poms.  Rock Bridge has won the girls' state golf title in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2011 and 2014, as well as the boys' state title in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. At the club level, Rock Bridge fields a lacrosse team in the spring and an ultimate frisbee team year round.<ref>http://www.bruinathletics.com/</ref>\n\n==Student Council==\nRock Bridge's Student Council consists of 10 students from each class, with four upperclassman making up the leadership team of Treasurer, Secretary, Vice-President, and President. Student Council is responsible for school-wide events take place through the year, including Homecoming, Courtwarming, Prom, and Powderpuff.\n\n==Journalism==\nFrom the time the school opened journalism has been part of the course offerings for the school. There was a newspaper, ''The Rock'', as well as a yearbook, ''Flashback''. In 1995, the school created a prerequisite class called Journalistic Writing, and the paper became a monthly publication. The journalism department created a special edition magazine, ''Southpaw'', in 2005, and in 2011, an online news source, ''Bearing News''.  ''The Rock'' began on letter-sized sheets that were published through a class. In 1994, it began its run as a monthly publication.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|Rock Bridge High School alumni}}\n*[[Carter Arey]], Team USA athlete\n*[[Rob Benedict]], actor{{citation needed|reason=lacks a reliable source confirming attendance|date=April 2019}}\n*[[Carl Edwards]], [[NASCAR]] driver\n*[[Tom Hart (sports announcer)|Tom Hart]], [[SEC Network]] announcer\n*[[Josh Kroenke]], businessperson\n*[[Trey Millard]], former [[National Football League|NFL]] fullback\n*[[Brian Wesbury]], economist\n*[[Timothy M.
