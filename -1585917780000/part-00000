It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]], to the anger of the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin]].\n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalm#118:25|Psalm 118: 25\u201326]] \u2013  Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] (2 Kings 9:13) reports that [[Jehu]], son of [[Jehoshaphat]], was treated this way. Both the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Gospel of John]] report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut [[Juncus|rushes]] on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek ''phoinix)''. In Jewish tradition, the palm is one of the [[Four Species]] carried for [[Sukkot]], as prescribed for rejoicing at {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:40}}.\n\nIn the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman culture]] of the [[Roman Empire]], which strongly influenced Christian tradition, the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch was a symbol]] of triumph and victory.

The day before Palm Sunday, [[Lazarus Saturday]], believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] in the church are changed to a festive color \u2013 most commonly green.\n\nThe [[Troparion]] of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is a prefiguration of Jesus's own Resurrection:\n\n{{quote|<poem>O Christ our God\nWhen Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead before Thy Passion,\nThou didst confirm the resurrection of the universe.\nWherefore, we like children,\ncarry the banner of triumph and victory,\nand we cry to Thee, O Conqueror of love,\nHosanna in the highest!\nBlessed is He that cometh\nin the Name of the Lord.</poem>}}\n\nIn the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Bavaria]]n and [[Austria]]n [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and various other [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples, the custom developed of using [[pussy willow]] instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north.  There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use [[olive]] branches. Whatever the kind, these branches are [[blessing|blessed]] and distributed together with candles either during the [[All-Night Vigil]] on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning. The [[Great Entrance]] of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\", so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the service, and keep them in their [[icon corner]] as an ''evloghia'' (blessing).\n\nIn Russia, [[donkey walk]] processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in [[Novgorod]] and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]], representing Christ, rode on a \"donkey\" (actually a horse draped in white cloth); the [[Tsar of Russia]] humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], but in 1658 [[Patriarch Nikon]] reversed the order of procession. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in the 1720s, as a part of his [[Church reform of Peter I|nationalisation of the church]], terminated the custom; it has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.\n\nIn [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Palm Sunday in Eastern and Oriental Christianity\">\nFile:Wjatscheslaw Grigorjewitsch Schwarz 002.jpg|Palm Sunday procession, Moscow, with Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei Michaelovich]] (painting by [[Vyacheslav Schwarz]], 1865)\nFile:Engraving of Red Square & Kremlin (Moscow, 1654).jpg|Palm Sunday in Moscow, 1654.<br />Caption on the illustration: ''Abrie\u00df der Muscowitischen Prozession am Palmsontag''\nFile:Palm sunday.JPG|[[Oriental Orthodox|Orthodox]] congregation in India collects palm fronds for [[procession]]: men on left of sanctuary in the photo; women collecting fronds on right of sanctuary, outside photo.\nFile:\u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u0443\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0408\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c (Church fresco - Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Bitola).jpg|[[Eastern Orthodox]] fresco in Nativity of the Theotokos Church, [[Bitola]], [[Republic of North Macedonia]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Palmsonntag in Osttimor 2019.jpg|thumb|Palm Sunday in [[East Timor]]]]\n\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple (1 Kings 6:29). Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus (Revelation 7:9).\n\nPalm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1\u20139), when palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of [[Holy Week]], the final week of Lent.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as well as among many [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] congregations, palm fronds (or in colder climates some kind of substitutes) are [[Blessing|blessed]] with an [[aspergillum]] outside the church building in an event called the \"blessing of palms\" if using palm leaves (or in cold climates in the [[narthex]] when Easter falls early in the year). A solemn procession also takes place, and often includes the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church, this feast now coincides with that of [[Passion Sunday]], which is the focus of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] which follows the palms ceremony. The palms are saved in many churches to be burned on [[Shrove Tuesday]] the following year to make ashes used in [[Ash Wednesday]] services.

Blessed is he who is come and is to come in the name of the Lord God\". These words are read to the congregation thrice. The congregation then repeats, \"Hosanna!\", and the flowers are scattered.

Congregants line the route, waving ''palasp\u00e1s'' (ornately woven palm branches) and spreading ''tapis'' (heirloom \"aprons\" made for this ritual) in imitation of the excited Jerusalemites. At the church parvise, a house, or the town plaza, children dressed as angels scatter flowers as they sing the day's [[antiphon]] ''Hosanna Filio David'' in the vernacular and to traditional tunes. The first Mass of the day then follows.\n\nOnce blessed, the ''palasp\u00e1s'' are brought home and placed on altars, doorways, and windows. The Church teaches that this is a sign of welcoming Christ into the home, but folk belief holds that the blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' are [[apotropaic]], deterring evil spirits, lightning, and fires. Another folk custom is to feed pieces of blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' to [[rooster]]s used in [[Cockfight#Philippines|''sabong'']] (cockfighting); this was strongly discouraged by the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In other provinces, the flowers strewn by the angels during the procession are added to the rice seeds being planted, in the belief that these will ensure a bountiful harvest.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:87365 Palm Sunday.jpg|thumb|A palm in [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]], [[Poland]]]]\nMany [[Poland|Polish]] towns and villages (the best known are [[Lipnica Murowana]] in [[Lesser Poland]] and [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]]) organize artificial palm competitions.

It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]], to the anger of the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin]].\n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalm#118:25|Psalm 118: 25\u201326]] \u2013  Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord.<ref name=\"MacArthur17\"/><ref name=Boring256 /><ref name=CEvans381 /><ref name=M133 />\n\nThe symbolism of the donkey may refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, unlike the horse which is the animal of war.<ref name=\"Allison120\"/> A king would have ridden a horse when he was bent on war and ridden a donkey to symbolize his arrival in peace. Jesus' entry to Jerusalem would have thus symbolized his entry as the [[Jesus|Prince of Peace]], not as a war-waging king.<ref name=Allison120 /><ref name=MacArthur17 /> Thus there have been two different meanings (or more levels of [[biblical hermeneutics]]): an historical meaning, truly happening according to the Gospels, and a secondary meaning in the symbolism.\n\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - Flevit super illam 1892.jpg|thumb|right|350px|\"Flevit super illam\" (He wept over it); by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1892]]\nIn [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#19:41|Luke 19:41]] as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as ''[[Jesus wept|Flevit super illam]]'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), foretelling his coming Passion and the suffering that awaits the city in the events of the destruction of the [[Second Temple]].\n\nIn many lands in the ancient [[Near East]], it was customary to cover in some way the path of someone thought worthy of the highest honour. The [[Hebrew Bible]] (2 Kings 9:13) reports that [[Jehu]], son of [[Jehoshaphat]], was treated this way. Both the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Gospel of John]] report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut [[Juncus|rushes]] on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek ''phoinix)''.

The day before Palm Sunday, [[Lazarus Saturday]], believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] in the church are changed to a festive color \u2013 most commonly green.\n\nThe [[Troparion]] of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is a prefiguration of Jesus's own Resurrection:\n\n{{quote|<poem>O Christ our God\nWhen Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead before Thy Passion,\nThou didst confirm the resurrection of the universe.\nWherefore, we like children,\ncarry the banner of triumph and victory,\nand we cry to Thee, O Conqueror of love,\nHosanna in the highest!\nBlessed is He that cometh\nin the Name of the Lord.</poem>}}\n\nIn the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Bavaria]]n and [[Austria]]n [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and various other [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples, the custom developed of using [[pussy willow]] instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north.  There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use [[olive]] branches. Whatever the kind, these branches are [[blessing|blessed]] and distributed together with candles either during the [[All-Night Vigil]] on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning. The [[Great Entrance]] of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\", so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the service, and keep them in their [[icon corner]] as an ''evloghia'' (blessing).\n\nIn Russia, [[donkey walk]] processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in [[Novgorod]] and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]], representing Christ, rode on a \"donkey\" (actually a horse draped in white cloth); the [[Tsar of Russia]] humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], but in 1658 [[Patriarch Nikon]] reversed the order of procession. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in the 1720s, as a part of his [[Church reform of Peter I|nationalisation of the church]], terminated the custom; it has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.\n\nIn [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Palm Sunday in Eastern and Oriental Christianity\">\nFile:Wjatscheslaw Grigorjewitsch Schwarz 002.jpg|Palm Sunday procession, Moscow, with Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei Michaelovich]] (painting by [[Vyacheslav Schwarz]], 1865)\nFile:Engraving of Red Square & Kremlin (Moscow, 1654).jpg|Palm Sunday in Moscow, 1654.<br />Caption on the illustration: ''Abrie\u00df der Muscowitischen Prozession am Palmsontag''\nFile:Palm sunday.JPG|[[Oriental Orthodox|Orthodox]] congregation in India collects palm fronds for [[procession]]: men on left of sanctuary in the photo; women collecting fronds on right of sanctuary, outside photo.\nFile:\u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u0443\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0408\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c (Church fresco - Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Bitola).jpg|[[Eastern Orthodox]] fresco in Nativity of the Theotokos Church, [[Bitola]], [[Republic of North Macedonia]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Palmsonntag in Osttimor 2019.jpg|thumb|Palm Sunday in [[East Timor]]]]\n\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple (1 Kings 6:29). Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus (Revelation 7:9).\n\nPalm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1\u20139), when palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of [[Holy Week]], the final week of Lent.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as well as among many [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] congregations, palm fronds (or in colder climates some kind of substitutes) are [[Blessing|blessed]] with an [[aspergillum]] outside the church building in an event called the \"blessing of palms\" if using palm leaves (or in cold climates in the [[narthex]] when Easter falls early in the year). A solemn procession also takes place, and often includes the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church, this feast now coincides with that of [[Passion Sunday]], which is the focus of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] which follows the palms ceremony. The palms are saved in many churches to be burned on [[Shrove Tuesday]] the following year to make ashes used in [[Ash Wednesday]] services. The Catholic Church considers the blessed palms to be [[sacramentals]]. The vestments for the day are deep scarlet red, the colour of blood, indicating the supreme redemptive sacrifice Christ was entering the city to fulfill: his Passion and Resurrection in Jerusalem.\n\n[[File:PalmSunday.jpg|thumb|right|Blessing of palms outside an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]]]]\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\nIn the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and many other Anglican churches and in Lutheran churches, as well, the day is nowadays officially called \"The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday\"; in practice, though, it is usually termed \"Palm Sunday\" as in the 1928 American [[Book of Common Prayer]] and in earlier Lutheran liturgies and calendars, to avoid undue confusion with the penultimate Sunday of Lent in the traditional calendar, which was \"Passion Sunday\".\n\nIn the [[Church of Pakistan]] (a member of the [[Anglican Communion]]), the faithful on Palm Sunday carry palm branches into the church as they sing [[Psalm 24]].\n\nIn many Protestant churches, children are given palms, and then walk in procession around the inside of the church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/palm-sunday-marks-start-of-holy-week.html|title=Palm Sunday Marks Start of Holy Week|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansday.com/life/a26557005/when-is-palm-sunday/|title=When Is Palm Sunday?

Roman history can be divided into the following periods: poo pooo poo\n\n*Pre-historical and early Rome, covering Rome's earliest inhabitants and the legend of its founding by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]].  \n*The [[Etruscan civilization|period of Etruscan dominance]] and the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal Period]], in which according to tradition, Romulus was the first of seven kings.\n*The [[Roman Republic]], which commenced in 509 BC when kings were replaced with rule by elected senators. The period was marked by vast expansion of Roman territory. During the 5th century BC, Rome gained regional dominance in [[Latium]], and eventually by the 3rd century BC.  With the [[Punic Wars]] from 264 to 146 BC, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] gained dominance over the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], displacing [[Carthage]] as the dominant regional power.\n*The [[Roman Empire]]:  With the rise of [[Julius Caesar]], the Republic waned and by all measures, concluded after a [[Final War of the Roman Republic|period of civil war]] and the victory of [[Octavian]], the adopted son of Caesar in 27 BC over [[Mark Antony]]. After the [[collapse of the Western Roman Empire]], Rome managed to hang onto the empire, still known as the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] but long centered on the eastern Mediterranean, until the 8th century as the [[Duchy of Rome]].  At this time, the city was reduced to a fraction of its former size, being sacked several times in the 5th to 6th centuries,  even temporarily depopulated entirely.<ref>Procopius, Gothic War, III.xxii. \"In Rome he suffered nothing human to remain, leaving it altogether, in every part, a perfect desert.\"</ref>\n*[[Medieval Rome]]: Characterized by a break with Byzantium and the formation of the Papal States. The Papacy struggled to retain influence in the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], and during the ''[[Saeculum obscurum]]'', the population of Rome fell to as low as 30,000 inhabitants. Following the [[East\u2013West Schism]] and the limited success in the [[Investiture Controversy]], the Papacy did gain considerable influence in high medieval Europe, but with the [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism]], the city of Rome was reduced to irrelevance, its population falling below 20,000. Rome's decline into complete irrelevance during the medieval period, with the associated lack of construction activity, assured the survival of very significant [[List of ancient monuments in Rome|ancient Roman material remains]] in the centre of the city, some abandoned and others continuing in use.\n*The [[Roman Renaissance]]: In the 15th century, Rome replaced Florence as the symbol of artistic and cultural influence.  The [[Roman Renaissance]] was cut short abruptly with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|devastation of the city]] in 1527, but the Papacy reasserted itself in the [[Counter-Reformation]], and the city continued to flourish during the early modern period. Rome was [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|annexed by Napoleon]] and was technically part of France during 1798\u20131814.\n*Modern History: The period from the 19th century to today.  Rome was under siege by the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] and was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed]] several times. It was declared an [[open city]] on 14 August 1943. Rome became the capital of the [[History of the Italian Republic|Italian Republic]] (established in 1946), with a population of 4.4 million  in its  ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}; 2.9 million within city limits)\u2014is the largest [[List of cities in Italy|city in Italy]].

The brothers argued, Romulus killed Remus, and then named the city Rome after himself. After founding and naming Rome (as the story goes), he permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens, including slaves and freemen without distinction.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8</ref> To provide his citizens with wives, Romulus invited the neighboring tribes to a festival in Rome where he abducted many of their young women (known as [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]). After the ensuing war with the [[Sabines]], Romulus shared the kingship with Sabine King [[Titus Tatius]].<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:9\u201313</ref> Romulus selected 100 of the most noble men to form the [[Roman senate]] as an advisory council to the king. These men he called patres, and their descendants became the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. He created three [[Centuria|centuries]] of [[equites]]: Ramnes (meaning Romans), Tities (after the Sabine king), and Luceres (Etruscans). He also divided the general populace into thirty [[curia]]e, named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius. The curiae formed the voting units in the [[Roman assemblies|Comitia Curiata]].<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8, 13</ref>\n\nAttempts have been made to find a linguistic root for the name Rome. Possibilities include derivation from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''\u1fec\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7'', meaning bravery, courage;<ref>Cf. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and his \"[[The Social Contract]]\", Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. \"''There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force.''\"</ref> possibly the connection is with a root ''*rum-'', \"teat\", with a theoretical reference to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately-named twins. The Etruscan name of the city seems to have been ''Ruma''.<ref>This has been deduced from the name of a figure painted in the [[Fran\u00e7ois Tomb]] at Vulci, inscribed in Etruscan ''Cneve Tarchunies Rumach'', interpreted as Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome. http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/francois.html</ref> Compare also ''Rumon'', former name of the Tiber River. Its further etymology remains unknown, as with most Etruscan words. [[Thomas George Tucker|Thomas G. Tucker]]'s ''Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin'' (1931) suggests that the name is most probably from ''*urobsma'' (cf. ''urbs'', ''robur'') and otherwise, \"but less likely\" from ''*urosma'' \"hill\" (cf. Skt. ''varsman-'' \"height, point,\" Old Slavonic \u0432\u0440\u044c\u0445\u044a \"top, summit\", Russ. \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \"top; upward direction\", Lith. ''virsus'' \"upper\").\n\n====City's formation====\nRome grew from pastoral settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] and [[Seven hills of Rome|surrounding hills]] approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] on the south side of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]]. The [[Quirinal Hill]] was probably an outpost for the [[Sabine]]s, another [[Italic languages|Italic]]-speaking people. At this location, the Tiber forms a Z-shaped curve that contains an [[Tiber Island|island]] where the river can be forded. Because of the river and the ford, Rome was at a crossroads of traffic following the river valley and of traders traveling north and south on the west side of the [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]].\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds have confirmed that there were two fortified settlements in the 8th century BC, in the area of the future Rome: Rumi on the Palatine Hill, and Titientes on the Quirinal Hill, backed by the Luceres living in the nearby woods.<ref name=\"Ismarmed.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ismarmed.com/early.html |title=History of Rome (Italy) |last=Ismarmed.com|work=ismarmed.com |year=2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> These were simply three of numerous Italic-speaking communities that existed in [[Latium]], a [[plain]] on the [[Italy|Italian]] peninsula, by the 1st millennium BC. The origins of the [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic peoples]] lie in prehistory and are therefore not precisely known, but their [[Indo-European languages]] migrated from the east in the second half of the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nAccording to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], many Roman historians (including Porcius Cato and Gaius Sempronius) regarded the origins of the Romans (descendants of the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]]) as Greek despite the fact that their knowledge was derived from Greek legendary accounts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|authorlink=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|title=Roman Antiquities|chapter=Book 1.11|quote=But the most learned of the Roman historians, among whom is Porcius Cato, who compiled with the greatest care the \"origins\" of the Italian cities, Gaius Sempronius and a great many others, say that they [Aborigines] were Greeks, part of those who once dwelt in Achaia, and that they migrated many generations before the Trojan war. But they do not go on to indicate either the Greek tribe to which they belonged or the city from which they removed, or the date or the leader of the colony, or as the result of what turns of fortune they left their mother country; and although they are following a Greek legend, they have cited no Greek historian as their authority.

In the 8th century BC, they shared the peninsula with two other major ethnic groups: the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in the North and the [[Greeks]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (''Etrusci'' or ''Tusci'' in [[Latin]]) were settled north of Rome in [[Etruria]] (modern northern Lazio, [[Tuscany]] and part of [[Umbria]]). They founded cities such as [[Tarquinia]], [[Veii]], and [[Volterra]] and deeply influenced Roman culture, as clearly shown by the Etruscan origin of some of the mythical Roman kings. The origins of the Etruscans are lost in prehistory. Historians have no literature, no texts of religion or philosophy; therefore, much of what is known about this civilisation is derived from grave goods and tomb findings.<ref name=\"Bonfante 2006, page 9\">[[#Bonfante2006|Larissa Bonfante:''Etruscan Inscriptions and Etruscan Religion in'' The Religion of the Etruscans \u2013 University of Texas Press 2006, page 9]]</ref>\nThe behaviour of the Etruscans has led to some confusion. Like Latin, Etruscan is inflected and Hellenised. Like the Indo-Europeans, the Etruscans were patrilineal and patriarchal. Like the Italics, they were war-like. The [[gladiator]]ial displays actually developed out of Etruscan funerary customs. Future studies of Etruscan and more excavations in the region will no doubt shed more light on the origin of Rome and the Romans.<ref>According to F\u00e9lix Gaffiot's''Dictionnaire Illustr\u00e9 Latin Fran\u00e7ais'', the term Tusci was used by the major authors of the [[Roman Republic]]: [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], et al. A number of cognate words developed, including Tuscia and Tusculanensis. Tusci was clearly the principal term used to designate things Etruscan. Etrusci and Etr\u016bria were used less often, mainly by Cicero and Horace, and they lack cognates. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the English use of Etruscan dates from 1706.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=etruscan&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had founded many colonies in Southern [[Italy]] between 750 and 550&nbsp;BC (which the Romans later called [[Magna Graecia]]), such as [[Cumae]], [[Naples]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Crotone]], [[Sybaris]], and [[Taranto]], as well as in the eastern two-thirds of [[Sicily]].<ref name=\"The Story of the Greeks\">{{cite web |url=http://example.invalid |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003085828/http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage-books.php?Dir=books&MenuItem=display&author=guerber&book=greeks&story=troy |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 October 2011 |title=Heritage History eBook Reader |first=H.

Roman tradition claimed that Rome had been under the control of [[Roman Kingdom|seven kings]] from 753 to [[509\u2013500&nbsp;BC|509&nbsp;BC]] beginning with the mythical [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] who was said to have [[founding of Rome|founded the city of Rome]] along with his brother [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]]. The last three kings were said to be Etruscan (at least partially)\u2014namely [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]]. (Priscus is said by the ancient literary sources to be the son of a Greek refugee and an Etruscan mother.) Their names refer to the Etruscan town of [[Tarquinia]].\n\nThis traditional account of Roman history has come down to us through [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], and others. It claims that Rome was ruled during its first centuries by a succession of seven kings. The traditional chronology, as codified by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], allots 243&nbsp;years for their reigns, an average of almost 35&nbsp;years, which has been generally discounted by modern scholarship since the work of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]]. The [[Gauls]] destroyed much of Rome's historical records when they sacked the city after the [[Battle of the Allia]] in 390&nbsp;BC (according to Polybius, the battle occurred in 387/6) and what was left was eventually lost to time or theft. With no contemporary records of the kingdom existing, all accounts of the kings must be carefully questioned.<ref>Asimov, Isaac. Asimov's Chronology of the World. New York: HarperCollins, 1991. p. 69.</ref> The list of kings is also of dubious historical value, though the last-named kings may be historical figures.\nIt is believed by some historians (again, this is disputed) that Rome was under the influence of the Etruscans for about a century. During this period, a bridge was built called the [[Pons Sublicius]] to replace the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] ford, and the [[Cloaca Maxima]] was also built; the Etruscans are said to have been great engineers of this type of structure. From a cultural and technical point of view, Etruscans had arguably the second-greatest impact on Roman development, only surpassed by the Greeks.\n\nExpanding further south, the Etruscans came into direct contact with the Greeks and initially had success in conflicts with the Greek colonists; after which, Etruria went into a decline. Taking advantage of this, Rome rebelled and gained independence from the Etruscans around 500&nbsp;BC. It also abandoned monarchy in favour of a republican system based on a [[Roman Senate|Senate]], composed of the nobles of the city, along with popular assemblies which ensured political participation for most of the freeborn men and elected magistrates annually.\n\nThe Etruscans left a lasting influence on Rome. The Romans learned to build temples from them, and the Etruscans may have introduced the worship of a triad of gods&nbsp;\u2014 [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]], and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]&nbsp;\u2014 from the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan gods]]: [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], [[Menrva]], and [[Tinia]]. However, the influence of Etruscan people in the development of Rome is often overstated.<ref>T.J. Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', 1990, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415015967}}</ref> Rome was primarily a Latin city. It never became fully Etruscan.

After 500&nbsp;BC, Rome joined with the Latin cities in defence against incursions by the [[Sabine]]s. Winning the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 493&nbsp;BC, Rome established again the supremacy over the Latin countries it had lost after the fall of the monarchy. After a lengthy series of struggles, this supremacy became fixed in 393, when the Romans finally subdued the [[Volsci]] and [[Aequi]]. In 394&nbsp;BC, they also conquered the menacing Etruscan neighbour of [[Veii]]. The Etruscan power was now limited to Etruria itself, and Rome was the dominant city in Latium.\n\nAlso a formal treaty with the city of [[Carthage]] is reported to have been made in the end of the 6th century BC, which defined the spheres of influence of each city and regulated the trade between them.\n[[File:Roman constitution.png|thumb|right|Chart Showing the Checks and Balances of the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman Constitution]].]]\n\nAt the same time, [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] states that 4th-century Rome is a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city.<ref name=\"Krimkevich\">{{cite web |url=http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0708/IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf |title=IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf (application/pdf Object) |first=Alexander |last=Krimkevich |work=bootheprize.stanford.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004193714/http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0708/IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRome's early enemies were the neighbouring hill tribes of the Volscians, the Aequi, and of course the Etruscans. As years passed and military successes increased Roman territory, new adversaries appeared. The fiercest were the [[Gauls]], a loose collective of peoples who controlled much of Northern Europe including what is modern North and Central-East Italy.\n\nIn 387&nbsp;BC, Rome was sacked and burned by the [[Senones]] coming from eastern Italy and led by [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], who had successfully defeated the Roman army at the [[Battle of the Allia]] in [[Etruria]]. Multiple contemporary records suggest that the Senones hoped to punish Rome for violating its diplomatic neutrality in Etruria. The Senones marched {{convert|130|km}} to Rome without harming the surrounding countryside; once sacked, the Senones withdrew from Rome.<ref>Ellis, \"The Celts: A History.\" pp. 61\u201364.

After 345&nbsp;BC, Rome pushed south against other Latins. Their main enemy in this quadrant were the fierce [[Samnium|Samnites]], who outsmarted and trapped the legions in 321&nbsp;BC at the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks|Battle of Caudine Forks]]. In spite of these and other temporary setbacks, the Romans advanced steadily. By 290&nbsp;BC, Rome controlled over half of the Italian peninsula. In the 3rd century BC, Rome brought the Greek [[polis|poleis]] in the south under its control as well.<ref name=\"JRank.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/6292/The-Dominance-Greece-Rome.html |title=The Dominance of Greece and Rome \u2013 polis, chora, acropolis, agora, latifundia, Atlas of the Roman World \u2013 Empire, Roman, Greek, Classical, Greeks, and Century |last=JRank.org |work=jrank.org |year=2009 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|left|Map showing Roman expansion in Italy.]]\n\nAmidst the never ending wars (from the beginning of the Republic up to the Principate, the doors of the temple of [[Janus]] were closed only twice \u2013 when they were open it meant that Rome was at war), Rome had to face a severe major social crisis, the [[Conflict of the Orders]], a political struggle between the [[plebs|Plebeian]]s (commoners) and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]]s (aristocrats) of the ancient [[Roman Republic]], in which the Plebeians sought political equality with the Patricians. It played a major role in the development of the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]]. It began in 494&nbsp;BC, when, while Rome was at war with two neighboring tribes, the Plebeians all left the city (the first [[secessio|Plebeian Secession]]). The result of this first secession was the creation of the office of [[Plebeian Tribune]], and with it the first acquisition of real power by the Plebeians.<ref name=\"Abbott, 28\">Abbott, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of downtown Rome during the Roman Empire large.png|thumb|220px|Map of the centre of Rome during the time of the Roman Empire]]\nAccording to tradition, Rome became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] in 509&nbsp;BC. However, it took a few centuries for Rome to become the great city of popular imagination. By the 3rd century BC, Rome had become the pre-eminent city of the Italian peninsula. During the [[Punic Wars]] between Rome and the great Mediterranean empire of Carthage (264 to 146&nbsp;BC), Rome's stature increased further as it became the capital of an overseas empire for the first time. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, Rome went through a significant population expansion as Italian farmers, driven from their ancestral farmlands by the advent of massive, slave-operated farms called [[latifundium|latifundia]], flocked to the city in great numbers. The victory over Carthage in the [[First Punic War]] brought the first two provinces outside the Italian peninsula, [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name=Fields,15>{{harvnb|Fields|2007|p=15}}.</ref> Parts of [[Spain]] ([[Hispania]]) followed, and in the beginning of the 2nd century the Romans got involved in the affairs of the Greek world. By then all Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek city-states were in decline, exhausted from endless civil wars and relying on mercenary troops.\n\nThe Romans looked upon the Greek civilisation with great admiration. The Greeks saw Rome as a useful ally in their civil strifes, and it wasn't long before the Roman legions were invited to intervene in Greece. In less than 50&nbsp;years the whole of mainland Greece was subdued. The Roman legions crushed the Macedonian phalanx twice, in 197 and 168&nbsp;BC; in 146&nbsp;BC the Roman consul [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus|Lucius Mummius]] razed [[Corinth]], marking the end of free Greece. The same year [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus]], the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], destroyed the city of [[Carthage]], making it a Roman province.\n\nIn the following years, Rome continued its conquests in Spain with [[Tiberius Gracchus]], and it set foot in Asia, when the last king of [[Pergamum]] gave his kingdom to the Roman people. The end of the 2nd century brought another threat, when a great host of [[Germanic peoples]], namely [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutons|Teutones]], crossed the river Rhone and moved to Italy. [[Gaius Marius]] was consul five consecutive times (seven total), and won two decisive battles in 102 and 101&nbsp;BC He also reformed the Roman army, giving it such a good reorganization that it remained unchanged for centuries.\n\nThe first thirty years of the last century BC were characterised by serious internal problems that threatened the existence of the Republic. The [[Social War (91\u201388&nbsp;BC)|Social War]], between Rome and its allies, and the [[Roman Servile Wars|Servile Wars]] (slave uprisings) were hard conflicts,<ref>Plutarch Life of Crassus 8</ref> all within Italy, and forced the Romans to change their policy with regards to their allies and subjects.<ref>'''Smith''', ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1041.html \"Servus\", p. 1038]; details the legal and military means by which people were enslaved.</ref> By then Rome had become an extensive power, with great wealth which derived from the conquered people (as tribute, food or manpower, i.e. slaves). The allies of Rome felt bitter since they had fought by the side of the Romans, and yet they were not citizens and shared little in the rewards. Although they lost the war, they finally got what they asked, and by the beginning of the 1st century AD practically all free inhabitants of Italy were Roman citizens.\n\nHowever, the growth of the Imperium Romanum (Roman power) created new problems, and new demands, that the old political system of the Republic, with its annually elected magistrates and its sharing of power, could not solve. The dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], the extraordinary commands of Pompey Magnus, and the first [[triumvirate]] made that clear. In January 49&nbsp;BC, [[Julius Caesar]] the conqueror of Gaul, marched his legions against Rome. In the following years, he vanquished his opponents, and ruled Rome for four years. After his assassination in 44&nbsp;BC, the Senate tried to reestablish the Republic, but its champions, [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] (descendant of the founder of the republic) and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] were defeated by Caesar's lieutenant [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] and Caesar's nephew, [[Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nThe years 44\u201331&nbsp;BC mark the struggle for power between Marcus Antonius and Octavian (later known as Augustus). Finally, on 2 September 31&nbsp;BC, in the Greek promontory of [[Actium]], the final battle took place in the sea. Octavian was victorious, and became the sole ruler of Rome (and its empire). That date marks the end of the Republic and the beginning of the [[Principate]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/fallofromanrepublic_article_01.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 History \u2013 The Fall of the Roman Republic |last=BBC History |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>The Roman Republic was never restored; but nor was it abolished, so the event which signaled its transition to [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation.

He is said to have remarked that he found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble (''Urbem latericium invenit, marmoream reliquit''). Augustus's successors sought to emulate his success in part by adding their own contributions to the city. In AD 64, during the reign of [[Nero]], the [[Great Fire of Rome]] left much of the city destroyed, but in many ways it was used as an excuse for new development.<ref name=\"Tacitus, Annals XV.40\">Tacitus, ''Annals''XV.40</ref><ref name=\"Fordham\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/diocassius-nero1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Dio Cassius: Nero and the Great Fire 64 AD |last=Fordham.edu|work=fordham.edu |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nRome was a subsidised city at the time, with roughly 15 to 25 percent of its grain supply being paid by the central government. Commerce and industry played a smaller role compared to that of other cities like [[Alexandria]]. This meant that Rome had to depend upon goods and production from other parts of the Empire to sustain such a large population. This was mostly paid by taxes that were levied by the Roman government. If it had not been subsidised, Rome would have been significantly smaller.<ref>Oates, W. J. (09, June 30). Population of Rome.

His son [[Commodus]], who had been co-emperor since AD 177, assumed full imperial power, which is most generally associated with the gradual decline of the Western Roman Empire. Rome's population was only a fraction of its peak when the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian Wall]] was completed in the year 273 (in that year its population was only around 500,000).\n\n====Crisis of the Third Century====\nStarting in the early 3rd century, matters changed. The \"[[Crisis of the Third Century|Crisis of the third century]]\" defines the disasters and political troubles for the Empire, which nearly collapsed. The new feeling of danger and the menace of barbarian invasions was clearly shown by the decision of Emperor [[Aurelian]], who at year 273 finished encircling the capital itself with a massive [[Aurelian Walls|wall]] which had a perimeter that measured close to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Rome formally remained capital of the [[Roman Empire|empire]], but emperors spent less and less time there. At the end of 3rd century [[Diocletian]]'s political reforms, Rome was deprived of its traditional role of administrative capital of the Empire. Later, [[Western Roman Empire|western emperors]] ruled from [[Milan]] or [[Ravenna]], or cities in [[Gaul]]. In 330, [[Constantine I]] established a second capital at [[Constantinople]]. At this time, part of the Roman aristocratic class moved to this new centre, followed by many of the artists and craftsmen who were living in the city.\n\n====Christianization====\n{{Further|Early Christianity|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|Constantinian shift|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n\n[[Christianity]] reached Rome during the 1st century AD. For the first two centuries of the [[Christian era]], Imperial authorities largely viewed Christianity simply as a Jewish sect rather than a distinct religion. No emperor issued general laws against the faith or its Church, and persecutions, such as they were, were carried out under the authority of local government officials.<ref>Graeme Clarke, \"Third-Century Christianity,\" in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 616; W.H.C.

In spite of its increasingly marginal role in the Empire, Rome retained its historic prestige, and this period saw the last wave of construction activity: Constantine's predecessor [[Maxentius]] built buildings such as its basilica in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], Constantine himself erected the [[Arch of Constantine]] to celebrate his victory over the former, and [[Diocletian]] built the greatest [[Baths of Diocletian|baths]] of all.

The previous [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] had been accomplished by the [[Gaul]]s under their leader [[Brennus (4th century)|Brennus]] in 387&nbsp;BC. The sacking of 410 is seen as a major landmark in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. [[St. Jerome]], living in Bethlehem at the time, wrote that \"The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken.\"<ref name=Jerome127>St Jerome, Letter CXXVII. To Principia, [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VI/The Letters of St. Jerome/Letter 127]] paragraph 12.</ref> These sackings of the city astonished all the Roman world. In any case, the damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population already started to decline from the late 4th century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire, with a population of not less than 650,000 inhabitants.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> \nThe decline greatly accelerated following the capture of [[Africa Proconsularis]] by the [[Vandals]]. Many inhabitants now fled as the city no longer could be supplied with grain from Africa from the mid-5th century onward.\n\nAt the beginning of the 6th century Rome's population may have been less than 100,000. Many monuments were being destroyed by the citizens themselves, who stripped stones from closed temples and other precious buildings, and even burned statues to make lime for their personal use. In addition, most of the increasing number of churches were built in this way. For example, the [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica|first Saint Peter's Basilica]] was erected using spoils from the abandoned [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=met>{{cite journal |author= Boorsch, Suzanne |date= Winter 1982\u20131983 |title= The Building of the Vatican: The Papacy and Architecture |journal= The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume= 40 |issue= 3 |pages= 4\u20138 |ref= harv}}</ref> This architectural cannibalism was a constant feature of Roman life until the [[Renaissance]]. From the 4th century, imperial edicts against stripping of stones and especially marble were common, but the need for their repetition shows that they were ineffective. Sometimes new churches were created by simply taking advantage of early Pagan temples, while sometimes changing the Pagan god or hero to a corresponding Christian saint or martyr. In this way, the Temple of Romulus and Remus became the basilica of the twin saints [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|Cosmas and Damian]].

This situation continued until [[Theodahad]] murdered [[Amalasuntha]], a pro-imperial Gothic queen, and usurped the power in 535. The [[List of Byzantine emperors|Eastern Roman emperor]], [[Justinian I]] (reigned 527\u2013565), used this as a pretext to send forces to Italy under his famed general [[Belisarius]], recapturing the city next year.

Belisarius was replaced by [[Narses]], who captured Rome from the Ostrogoths for good in 552, ending the so-called [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic Wars]] which had devastated much of Italy. The continual war around Rome in the 530s and 540s left it in a state of total disrepair \u2014 near-abandoned and desolate with much of its lower-lying parts turned into unhealthy marshes as the drainage systems were neglected and the Tiber's embankments fell into disrepair in the course of the latter half of the 6th century.<ref>P.

There is a legend, significant though untrue, that there was a moment where no one remained living in Rome. {{citation needed|reason=No source given for the legend|date=November 2014}}\n\nJustinian I provided grants for the maintenance of public buildings, aqueducts and bridges \u2014 though, being mostly drawn from an [[Italy]] dramatically impoverished by the recent wars, these were not always sufficient. He also styled himself the patron of its remaining [[scholarly method|scholar]]s, [[orator]]s, [[physician]]s and [[lawyer]]s in the stated hope that eventually more youths would seek a better [[education]]. After the wars, the Senate was theoretically restored, but under the supervision of the [[Praefectus urbi|urban prefect]] and other officials appointed by, and responsible to, the Byzantine authorities in [[Ravenna]].\n\nHowever, the Pope was now one of the leading religious figures in the entire Byzantine Empire and effectively more powerful locally than either the remaining senators or local Byzantine officials. In practice, local power in Rome devolved to the Pope and, over the next few decades, both much of the remaining possessions of the senatorial aristocracy and the local Byzantine administration in Rome were absorbed by the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nThe reign of Justinian's nephew and successor [[Justin II]] (reigned 565\u2013578) was marked from the [[Italy|Italian]] point of view by the invasion of the [[Lombards]] under [[Alboin]] (568). In capturing the regions of [[Benevento]], [[Lombardy]], [[Piedmont]], [[Spoleto]] and [[Tuscany]], the invaders effectively restricted Imperial authority to small islands of land surrounding a number of coastal cities, including [[Ravenna]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and the area of the future [[Venice]]. The one inland city continuing under Byzantine control was [[Perugia]], which provided a repeatedly threatened overland link between Rome and Ravenna. In 578 and again in 580, the Senate, in some of its last recorded acts, had to ask for the support of [[Tiberius II Constantine]] (reigned 578\u2013582) against the approaching Dukes, [[Faroald I of Spoleto]] and [[Zotto]] of [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]].\n\n[[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (reigned 582\u2013602) added a new factor in the continuing conflict by creating an alliance with [[Childebert II|Childebert II of Austrasia]] (reigned 575\u2013595). The armies of the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish King]] invaded the Lombard territories in 584, 585, 588 and 590. Rome had suffered badly from a disastrous flood of the Tiber in 589, followed by a plague in 590. The latter is notable for the [[legend]] of the [[angel]] seen, while the newly elected [[Pope Gregory I]] (term 590\u2013604) was passing in procession by [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's Tomb]], to hover over the building and to sheathe his flaming sword as a sign that the pestilence was about to cease. The city was safe from capture at least.\n\n[[Agilulf]], however, the new Lombard King (reigned 591 to c. 616), managed to secure peace with [[Childebert II|Childebert]], reorganised his territories and resumed activities against both [[Naples]] and Rome by 592. With the Emperor preoccupied with wars in the eastern borders and the various succeeding [[Exarch]]s unable to secure Rome from invasion, Gregory took personal initiative in starting negotiations for a [[peace treaty]]. This was completed in the autumn of 598\u2014later recognised by Maurice\u2014lasting until the end of his reign.\n\nThe position of the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] was further strengthened under the usurper [[Phocas]] (reigned 602\u2013610). Phocas recognised his primacy over that of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and even decreed [[Pope Boniface III]] (607) to be \"the head of all the [[Christian Church|Churches]]\". Phocas's reign saw the erection of the last imperial monument in the [[Roman Forum]], the [[column of Phocas|column]] bearing his name. He also gave the Pope the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], at the time closed for centuries, and thus probably saved it from destruction.\n\nDuring the 7th century, an influx of both Byzantine officials and churchmen from elsewhere in the empire made both the local lay aristocracy and Church leadership largely Greek speaking. The population of Rome, a magnet for pilgrims, may have increased to 90,000.<ref>[[Richard Krautheimer]], Rome, Profile of a City 312-1308, 2000 pp. 62-64 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Eleven of thirteen Popes between 678 and 752 were of Greek or Syrian descent.<ref>Krautheimer, p. 90</ref>  However, the strong Byzantine cultural influence did not always lead to political harmony between Rome and Constantinople. In the controversy over [[Monothelitism]], popes found themselves under severe pressure (sometimes amounting to physical force) when they failed to keep in step with Constantinople's shifting theological positions. In 653, [[Pope Martin I]] was deported to Constantinople and, after a show trial, exiled to the Crimea, where he died.<ref name=\"Catholic Online\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=80 |title=Pope Saint Martin I \u2013 Saints & Angels \u2013 Catholic Online |last=Catholic Online |work=catholic.org |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09723c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA: Pope Saint Martin I |last=Catholic Encyclopaedia |work=newadvent.org |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThen, in 663, Rome had its first imperial visit for two centuries, by [[Constans II]]\u2014its worst disaster since the Gothic Wars when the Emperor proceeded to strip Rome of metal, including that from buildings and statues, to provide armament materials for use against the [[Saracen]]s.

He conquered [[Ferrara]] and [[Ravenna]], ending the Exarchate of Ravenna. Rome seemed his next victim. In 754, [[Pope Stephen II]] went to France to name [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]], king of the [[Franks]], as ''patricius romanorum'', i.e. protector of Rome. In the August of that year the King and Pope together crossed back the Alps and defeated Aistulf at [[Pavia]]. When Pippin went back to St. Denis however, Aistulf did not keep his promises, and in 756 besieged Rome for 56&nbsp;days. The Lombards returned north when they heard news of Pippin again moving to Italy. This time he agreed to give the Pope the promised territories, and the [[Papal States]] were born.\n\nIn 771 the new King of the Lombards, [[Desiderius]], devised a plot to conquer Rome and seize [[Pope Stephen III]] during a feigned pilgrimage within its walls. His main ally was one Paulus Afiarta, chief of the Lombard party within the city. He conquered Rome in 772 but angered Charlemagne. However the plan failed, and Stephens' successor, [[Pope Adrian I|Pope Hadrian I]] called [[Charlemagne]] against Desiderius, who was finally defeated in 773.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Einhard: The Life of Charlemagne |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> The Lombard Kingdom was no more, and now Rome entered into the orbit of a new, greater political institution.\n\nNumerous remains from this period, along with a museum devoted to Medieval Rome, can be seen at [[Museo Nazionale Romano Crypta Balbi|Crypta Balbi]] in Rome.\n\n===Formation of the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{further|Papal States|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Sylvester I and Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century fresco of Sylvester and Constantine, showing the [[Donation of Constantine]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], Rome]]\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro 1450.jpg|thumb|19th-century drawing of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] as it is thought to have looked around 1450&nbsp;AD]]\n[[File:Forum temple of vespasian.jpg|thumb|From the Forum, the medieval and Renaissance Senate House stands directly upon the [[Tabularium]], ancient Rome's repository of archives.]]\n\nOn 25 April, 799 the new Pope, [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], led the traditional procession from the [[Lateran]] to the Church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]] along the [[Via Flaminia]] (now [[Via del Corso]]). Two nobles (followers of his predecessor Hadrian) who disliked the weakness of the Pope with regards to Charlemagne, attacked the processional train and delivered a life-threatening wound to the Pope. Leo fled to the King of the Franks, and in November, 800, the King entered Rome with a strong army and a number of French bishops. He declared a judicial trial to decide if Leo III were to remain Pope, or if the deposers' claims had reasons to be upheld. This trial, however, was only a part of a well thought out chain of events which ultimately surprised the world. The Pope was declared legitimate and the attempters subsequently exiled. On 25 December, 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\nThis act forever severed the loyalty of [[Rome]] from its imperial progenitor, [[Constantinople]]. It created instead a rival empire which, after a long series of conquests by [[Charlemagne]], now encompassed most of the Christian Western territories.\n\nFollowing the death of Charlemagne, the lack of a figure with equal prestige led the new institution into disagreement. At the same time the universal [[Catholic Church|church]] of Rome had to face emergence of the lay interests of the City itself, spurred on by the conviction that the Roman people, though impoverished and abased, had again the right to elect the Western Emperor. The famous counterfeit document called the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'', prepared by the Papal notaries, guaranteed to the Pope a dominion<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/donatconst.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: The Donation of Constantine |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref>In many manuscripts, including the oldest one, which dates from the 9th century, the document bears the title ''Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris''.{{CathEncy|wstitle=Donation of Constantine}}</ref> stretching from [[Ravenna]] to [[Gaeta]]. This nominally included the suzerainty over Rome, but this was often highly disputed, and as the centuries passed, only the strongest Popes were to be able to assert it. The main element of weakness of the Papacy within the walls of the city was the continued necessity of the election of new popes, in which the emerging noble families soon managed to insert a leading role for themselves. The neighbouring powers, namely the [[Duchy of Spoleto]] and [[Tuscany|Toscana]], and later the Emperors, learned how to take their own advantage of this internal weakness, playing the role of arbiters among the contestants.\n\nRome was indeed prey of anarchy in this age. The lowest point was touched in 897, when a raging crowd [[exhume]]d the corpse of a dead pope, [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]], and [[Cadaver Synod|put it on trial]].<ref name=\"Georgia Law\">{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=fac_pm |title=The Cadaver Synod: Strangest Trial in History|first=Donald E. |last=Wilkes Jr. |work=digitalcommons.law.uga.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>\"Nor was he [[Pope Sergius III|Sergius III]] content with thus dishonouring the dead [[Pope Formosus]], but he drags his carcass again out of the grave, beheads it as if it had been alive, and then throws it into the Tiber, as unworthy the honour of human burial.\" {{Cite journal|last= Platina|first= Bartolomeo|authorlink= Bartolomeo Platina|title= The Lives of the Popes From The Time Of Our Saviour Jesus Christ to the Accession of Gregory VII|publisher= Griffith Farran & Co.|location= London|page= 243|volume= I|url= https://archive.org/details/thelivesofthepop01platuoft|accessdate=8 January 2008|ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cfpeople.org/Books/Pope/POPEp120.htm#T1|title=Sergius III|accessdate=2 January 2008|last=Brusher|first=Joseph|publisher=Neff-Kane|year=1959|journal=Popes Through the Ages|ref=harv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112051806/http://www.cfpeople.org/books/pope/POPEp120.htm#T1|archive-date=12 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last= Milman|first= Henry Hart|authorlink= Henry Hart Milman|title= History of Latin Christianity|publisher= John Murray|year= 1867|location= London|pages= 287\u2013290|volume= III|edition= 4th|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Commune===\n{{See also|Commune of Rome|14 regions of Medieval Rome}}\n\nFrom 1048 to 1257, the papacy experienced increasing conflict with the leaders and churches of the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. The latter culminated in the East-West Schism, dividing the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. From 1257 to 1377, the pope, though the bishop of Rome, resided in Viterbo, Orvieto, and Perugia, and then Avignon. The return of the popes to Rome after the Avignon Papacy was followed by the Western Schism: the division of the western church between two, and for a time three, competing papal claimants.\n\nIn this period the renovated [[Catholic Church|Church]] was again attracting pilgrims and [[prelate]]s from all the Christian world, and money with them: even with a population of only 30,000, Rome was again becoming a city of consumers dependent upon the presence of a governmental bureaucracy. In the meantime, Italian cities were acquiring increasing autonomy, mainly led by new families which were replacing the old aristocracy with a new class formed by entrepreneurs, traders and merchants. After the sack of Rome by the [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] in 1084, the rebuilding of the city was supported by powerful families such as the [[Frangipani family|Frangipane family]] and the [[Pierleoni family]], whose wealth came from commerce and banking rather than landholdings. Inspired by neighbouring cities like [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] and [[Viterbo]], Rome's people began to consider adopting a communal status and gaining a substantial amount of freedom from papal authority.\n\nLed by [[Giordano Pierleoni]], the Romans rebelled against the aristocracy and Church rule in 1143. The Senate and the Roman Republic, the [[Commune of Rome]], were born again. Through the inflammatory words of preacher [[Arnold of Brescia|Arnaldo da Brescia]], an idealistic, fierce opponent of ecclesiastical property and church interference in temporal affairs, the revolt that led to the creation of the [[Commune of Rome]] continued until it was put down in 1155, though it left its mark on the civil government of the Eternal City for centuries. 12th-century Rome, however, had little in common with the empire which had ruled over the Mediterranean some 700&nbsp;years before, and soon the new Senate had to work hard to survive, choosing an ambiguous policy of shifting its support from the Pope to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and vice versa as the political situation required. At [[Battle of Monte Porzio|Monteporzio]], in 1167, during one of these shifts, in the war with Tusculum, Roman troops were defeated by the imperial forces of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]. Luckily, the winning enemies were soon dispersed by a plague and Rome was saved.\n\n[[File:Santa Maria in Trastevere-inside.jpg|thumb|220px|Interior of the basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere, one of the most beautiful Roman churches built or re-built in the Middle Ages]]\n\nIn 1188 the new communal government was finally recognised by [[Pope Clement III]]. The Pope had to make large cash payments to the communal officials, while the 56 senators became papal vassals. The Senate always had problems in the accomplishment of its function, and various changes were tried. Often a single Senator was in charge. This sometimes led to tyrannies, which did not help the stability of the newborn organism.\n\n===Guelphs and Ghibellines===\n{{further|Guelphs and Ghibellines}}\nIn 1204 the streets of Rome were again in flames when the struggle between [[Pope Innocent III|Pope Innocent III's]] family and its rivals, the powerful [[Orsini family]], led to riots in the city. Many ancient buildings were then destroyed by machines used by the rival bands to besiege their enemies in the innumerable towers and strongholds which were a hallmark of the Middle Age Italian towns.\n\n[[File:0209tordeiconti.png|thumb|left|220px|The [[Torre dei Conti]] was one of the many towers built by the noble families of Rome to mark their power and defend themselves in the several feuds that marked the city in the Middle Ages. Only the lower third part of Torre dei Conti can be seen today.]]\n\nThe struggle between the Popes and the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], also king of [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], saw Rome support the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]]s. To repay his loyalty, Frederick sent to the commune the [[Carroccio]] he had won to the [[Lombardy|Lombards]] at the [[battle of Cortenuova]] in 1234, and which was exposed in the [[Capitoline Hill|Campidoglio]].\n\nIn that year, during another revolt against the Pope, the Romans headed by senator [[Luca Savelli]] sacked the [[Lateran]]. Curiously, Savelli was the nephew of [[Pope Honorius III]] and father of [[Pope Honorius IV|Honorius IV]], but in that age family ties often did not determine one's allegiance.\n\nRome was never to evolve into an autonomous, stable reign, as happened to other communes like [[Florence]], [[Siena]] or [[Milan]]. The endless struggles between noble families ([[Savelli family|Savelli]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]]), the ambiguous position of the Popes, the haughtiness of a population which never abandoned the dreams of their splendid past but, at the same time, thought only of immediate advantage, and the weakness of the republican institutions always deprived the city of this possibility.\n\nIn an attempt to imitate more successful communes, in 1252 the people elected a foreign Senator, the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] [[Brancaleone degli Andal\u00f2]]. In order to bring peace in the city he suppressed the most powerful nobles (destroying some 140 towers), reorganised the working classes and issued a code of laws inspired by those of northern Italy. Brancaleone was a tough figure, but died in 1258 with almost nothing of his reforms turned into reality. Five years later [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I of Anjou]], then king of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], was elected Senator. He entered the city only in 1265, but soon his presence was needed to face [[Conradin]], the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]]'s heir who was coming to claim his family's rights over southern Italy, and left the city. After June 1265 Rome was again a democratic republic, electing [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Henry of Castile]] as senator. But Conradin and the Ghibelline party were crushed in the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] (1268), and therefore Rome fell again in the hands of Charles.\n\n[[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]], a member of [[Orsini family]], was elected in 1277 and moved the seat of the [[List of popes|Popes]] from the [[Lateran Palace|Lateran]] to the more defensible [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. He also ordered that no foreigner could become senator of Rome. Being a Roman himself, he had himself elected senator by the people. With this move, the city began again to side for the papal party. In 1285 Charles was again Senator, but the [[Sicilian Vespers]] reduced his charisma, and the city was thenceforth free from his authority. The next senator was again a Roman, and again a pope, [[Pope Honorius IV|Honorius IV]] of the Savelli.\n\n===Boniface VIII and the Babylonian captivity===\nThe successor to [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]] was a Roman of the Caetani family, [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]]. Entangled in a local feud against the traditional rivals of his family, the [[Colonna family|Colonna]], at the same time he struggled to assure the universal supremacy of the [[Holy See]]. In 1300 he launched the first [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] and in 1303 founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|first University of Rome]].<ref name=\"Sapienza University\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.uniroma1.it/about/default_e.php |title=Sapienza &#62; About us |last=Sapienza University of Rome |work=www2.uniroma1.it |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08531c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA: Holy Year of Jubilee |last=Catholic Encyclopaedia |work=newadvent.org |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> The Jubilee was an important move for Rome, as it further increased its international prestige and, most of all, the city's economy was boosted by the flow of pilgrims.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\"/> Boniface died in 1303 after the humiliation of the ''[[Anagni|Schiaffo di Anagni]]'' (\"Slap of Anagni\"), which signalled instead the rule of the [[France|King of France]] over the [[Pope|Papacy]] and marked another period of decline for Rome.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\"/><ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianchronicler.com/history1/avignon_papacy.html |title=THE AVIGNON PAPACY |last=ChristianChronicler.com |work=christianchronicler.com |year=2006 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoniface's successor, [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]], never entered the city, starting the so-called \"[[Avignon Papacy|Babylonian captivity]]\", the absence of the Popes from their Roman seat in favour of [[Avignon]], which would last for more than 70&nbsp;years.<ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\"/><ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.</ref> This situation brought the independence of the local powers, but these were revealed to be largely unstable; and the lack of the holy revenues caused a deep decay of Rome.<ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\"/><ref name=\"Morris\"/> For more than a century Rome had no new major buildings.

Though short-lived, his attempt is recorded by a 19th-century statue near the ramped ''[[Cordonata]]'' leading to Michelangelo's [[Capitoline Hill|Piazza del Campidoglio]].]]\n\nIn spite of its decline and the absence of the Pope, Rome had not lost its spiritual prestige: in 1341 the famous poet [[Petrarch|Petrarca]] came to the city to be crowned as [[Poet laureate]] in [[Capitoline Hill]]. Noblemen and poor people at one time demanded with one voice the return of the Pope. Among the many ambassadors that in this period took their way to [[Avignon]], emerged the bizarre but eloquent figure of [[Cola di Rienzo]]. As his personal power among the people increased by time, on 20 May 1347 he conquered the Capitoline at the head of an enthusiastic crowd. The period of his power, though very short-lived, aspired to the prestige of Ancient Rome. Now in possession of dictatorial powers, he took the title of \"tribune\", referring to the [[plebs|pleb]]'s [[tribune|magistracy]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Cola also considered himself at an equal status of that of the Holy Roman Emperor. On 1 August, he conferred Roman citizenship on all the Italian cities, and even prepared for the election of a Roman emperor of Italy. It was too much: the Pope denounced him as heretic, criminal and pagan, the populace had begun to be disenchanted with him, while the nobles had always hated him. On 15 December, he was forced to flee.\n[[File:CasaDiColadiRienzoByRoeslerFranz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The so-called ''Casa di Rienzi'' still in its urban context before the opening of the ''Via del Mare'' in a [[watercolour]] by [[Ettore Roesler Franz]] (about 1880).]]\nIn August 1354, Cola was again a protagonist, when Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Gil Alvarez De Albornoz]] entrusted him with the role of \"senator of Rome\" in his program of reassuring the Pope's rule in the [[Papal States]]. In October the tyrannical Cola, who had become again very unpopular for his delirious behaviour and heavy bills, was killed in a riot provoked by the powerful family of the [[Colonna family|Colonna]]. In April 1355, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of [[Bohemia]] entered the city for the ritual coronation as Emperor. His visit was very disappointing for the citizens. He had little money, received the crown not from the Pope but from a Cardinal, and moved away after a few days.\n\nWith the emperor back in his lands, Albornoz could regain a certain control over the city, while remaining in his safe citadel in [[Montefiascone]], in the Northern Lazio. The senators were chosen directly by the Pope from several cities of Italy, but the city was in fact independent. The Senate council included six judges, five notaries, six marshals, several familiars, twenty knights and twenty armed men. Albornoz had heavily suppressed the traditional aristocratic families, and the \"democratic\" party felt confident enough to start an aggressive policy. In 1362 Rome declared war on [[Velletri]]. This move, however, provoked a civil war. The countryside party hired a [[condottieri]] band called \"Del Cappello\" (\"Hat\"), while the Romans bought the services of [[Germany|German]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] troops, plus a citizen levy of 600 knights and even 22,000 infantry. This was the period in which condottieri bands were active in Italy. Many of the Savelli, Orsini and Annibaldi expelled from Rome became leaders of such military units. The war with Velletri languished, and Rome again gave itself to the new Pope, [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]], provided Albornoz did not enter the walls.\n\nOn 16 October 1367, in reply to the prayers of [[Brigid of Kildare|St Brigid]] and [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Urban finally visited for the city. During his presence, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] was again crowned in the city (October 1368). In addition, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[John V Palaiologos|John V Palaeologus]] came in Rome to beg for a crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]], but in vain. However, Urban did not like the unhealthy air of the city, and on 5 September 1370 he sailed again to [[Avignon]]. His successor, [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]], officially set the date of his return to Rome at May 1372, but again the [[France|French]] cardinals and the King stopped him.\n\nOnly on 17 January 1377, Gregory XI could finally reinstate the [[Holy See]] in Rome.\n\n===Western schism and conflict with Milan===\nThe incoherent behaviour of his successor, the Italian [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], provoked in 1378 the [[Western Schism]], which impeded any true attempt of improving the conditions of the decaying Rome.\nThe 14th century, with the absence of the popes during the [[Avignon Papacy]], had been a century of neglect and misery for the city of Rome, which dropped to its lowest level of population. \nWith the return of the papacy to Rome repeatedly postponed because of the bad conditions of the city and the lack of control and security, it was first necessary to strengthen the political and doctrinal aspects of the pontiff.\n\nWhen in 1377 [[Gregory XI]] was in fact returned to Rome, he found a city in anarchy because of the struggles between the nobility and the popular faction, and in which his power was now more formal than real. There followed four decades of instability, characterised by the local power struggle between the commune and the papacy, and internationally by the great [[Western Schism]], at the end of which was elected Pope, [[Martin V]]. He restored order, laying the foundations of its rebirth.<ref>Ludovico Gatto, ''History of Rome in the Middle Ages'', Rome, Newton & Compton, 1999. {{ISBN|88-8289-273-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Lightmatter Sistine Chapel ceiling.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michelangelo]]'s ceiling in the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n\nIn 1433 the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] signed a peace treaty with [[Florence]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. He then sent the [[condottieri]] [[Niccol\u00f2 Fortebraccio]] and [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] to harass the [[Papal States]], in vengeance for [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]]'s support to the two former republics.\n\nFortebraccio, supported by the [[Colonna family|Colonna]], occupied Tivoli in October 1433 and ravaged Rome's countryside. Despite the concessions made by Eugene to the Visconti, the Milanese soldiers did not stop their destruction. This led the Romans, on 29 May 1434 to institute a Republican government under the ''Banderesi''. Eugene left the city a few days later, during the night of 4 June.\n\nHowever, the ''Banderesi'' proved incapable of governing the city, and their inadequacies and violence soon deprived them of popular support. The city was therefore returned to Eugene by the army of [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]] on 26 October 1434. After the death in mysterious circumstances of Vitelleschi, the city came under the control of [[Ludovico Scarampo]], [[List of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]]. Eugene returned to Rome on 28 September 1443.\n\n==Renaissance Rome==\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; width:300px; margin:0.5em 0 1em 1em; background:White; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"|<big><big>Rome Timeline</big></big>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"|'''Renaissance and early modern Rome'''\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"|c. 1420s\u20131519\n|style=\"font-size: 90%;\"|Rome becomes a centre of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]].

The Papacy wanted to surpass the grandeur of other Italian cities. To this end the popes created increasingly extravagant churches, bridges, town squares and public spaces, including a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] since antiquity), and [[Piazza Navona]]. The Popes were also patrons of the arts engaging such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nUnder [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became Pontiff on 19 March 1447, the [[Renaissance]] can be said to have begun in Rome, heralding a period in which the city became the centre of [[Humanism]]. He was the first Pope to embellish the Roman court with scholars and artists, including [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nOn 4 September 1449 Nicholas proclaimed a [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] for the following year, which saw a great influx of pilgrims from all Europe. The crowd was so large that in December, on [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], some 200 people died, crushed underfoot or drowned in the [[River Tiber]]. Later that year the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] reappeared in the city, and Nicholas fled.\n\n[[File:Roma1493.png|thumb|left|300px|View of Rome in 1493]]\n\nHowever Nicholas brought stability to the temporal power of the Papacy, a power in which the Emperor was to have no part at all. In this way, the coronation and the marriage of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] on 16 March 1452, was more a civil ceremony. The Papacy now controlled Rome with a strong hand. A plot by [[Stefano Porcari]], whose aim was the restoration of the Republic, was ruthlessly suppressed on January 1453. Porcari was hanged together with the other plotters, Francesco Gabadeo, Pietro de Monterotondo, Battista Sciarra and Angiolo Ronconi, but the Pope gained a treacherous reputation, as when the execution was beginning he was too drunk to confirm the grace he had previously given to Sciarra and Ronconi.\n\nNicholas was also actively involved in Rome's urban renewal, in collaboration with [[Leon Battista Alberti]], including the construction of a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]].\n[[File:St. Peter Niccoline Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|A painting from the [[Roman Renaissance]].]]\nNicholas' successor [[Pope Callixtus III|Calixtus III]] neglected Nicholas's cultural policies, instead devoting himself to his greatest passion, his nephews. The [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], who took the reins after his death in 1458, was a great Humanist, but did little for Rome. During his reign [[Lorenzo Valla]] demonstrated that the [[Donation of Constantine]] was a forgery. Pius was the first Pope to use guns, in campaign against the rebel barons Savelli in the neighbourhood of Rome, in 1461. One year later the bringing to Rome of the head of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] [[Saint Andrew|St. Andrew]] produced a great number of pilgrims. The reign of [[Pope Paul II]] (1464\u20131471) was notable only for the reintroduction of the [[Carnival]], which was to become a very popular feast in Rome in the following centuries. In the same year (1468) a plot against the Pope was uncovered, organised by the intellectuals of the [[Roman Academies|Roman Academy]] founded by [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponio Leto]]. The conspirators were sent to Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\n[[File:Roma-tempiettobramante01R.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Tempietto'' ([[San Pietro in Montorio]]), an excellent example of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture]]\n\nMore important by far was the Pontificate of [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], considered the first Pope-King of Rome. In order to favour his relative [[Girolamo Riario]], he promoted the unsuccessful [[Pazzi|Congiura dei Pazzi]] against the [[House of Medici|Medici]] of Florence (26 April 1478) and in Rome fought the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] and the [[Orsini family|Orsini]]. The personal politics of intrigue and war required much money, but in spite of this Sixtus was a true patron of art in the manner of [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]]. He reopened the Academy and reorganised the Collegio degli Abbreviatori, and in 1471 began the construction of the [[Vatican Library]], whose first curator was Platina. The Library was officially founded on 15 June 1475. He restored several churches, including [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], the [[Aqua Virgo]] and the Hospital of the Holy Spirit; paved several streets and also built a famous bridge over the [[Tiber]] river, which still bears his name. His main building project was the [[Sistine Chapel]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]]. Its decoration called on some of the most renowned artists of the age, including [[Mino da Fiesole]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Luca Signorelli]] and [[Pinturicchio]], and in the 16th century [[Michelangelo]] decorated the ceiling with his famous masterpiece, contributing to what became one of the most famous monuments of the world. Sixtus died on 12 August 1484.\n\nChaos, corruption and nepotism appeared in Rome under the reign of his successors, [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503). During the vacation period between the death of the former and the election of the latter there were 220 murders in the city. Alexander had to face [[Charles VIII of France]], who invaded Italy in 1494 and entered Rome on 31 December of that year. The Pope could only barricade himself into [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], which had been turned into a true fortress by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]]. In the end, the skilful Alexander was able to gain the support of the king, assigning his son [[Cesare Borgia]] as military counsellor for the subsequent invasion of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Rome was safe and, as the King directed himself southwards, the Pope again changed his position, joining the anti-French League of the Italian States which finally compelled Charles to flee to France.\n\nThe most nepotist Pope of all, Alexander, favoured his ruthless son Cesare, creating for him a personal [[Duchy]] out of territories of the [[Papal States]], and banning from Rome Cesare's most relentless enemy, the Orsini family. In 1500 the city hosted a new Jubilee, but grew ever more unsafe as, especially at night, the streets were controlled by bands of lawless \"bravi\". Cesare himself assassinated [[Alfonso of Bisceglie]]; as well as, presumably, the Pope's son, Giovanni of Gandia.\n\nThe Renaissance had a great impact on Rome's appearance, with works like the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartment]], all made during Innocent's reign. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the Medici family. During this twenty-year period Rome became the greatest centre of art in the world. The old [[St. Peter's Basilica]] was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the Temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican; [[Raphael]], who in Rome became the most famous painter in Italy, creating frescos in the [[Niccoline Chapel|Cappella Niccolina]], the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], and many other famous paintings. Michelangelo began the decoration of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and executed the famous statue of [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]] for the tomb of Julius. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes.

The prestige of Rome was then challenged by the defections of the churches of Germany and England. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) tried to recover the situation by summoning the [[Council of Trent]]o, although being, at the same time, the most nepotist Pope of all. He even separated [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] from the [[Papal States]] to create an independent [[Duchy of Parma|duchy]] for his son [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi]].<ref name=\"Seattle Catholic\"/> He continued the patronage of art supporting the Michelangelo's ''[[Last Judgment]]'', asking him to renovate the [[Capitoline Hill|Campidoglio]] and the ongoing construction of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]].

They had to remain in the [[rioni of Rome|rione]] [[Sant'Angelo (rione of Rome)|Sant'Angelo]] and locked in at night. The Pope decreed that Jews should wear a distinctive sign, yellow hats for men<ref>Frank J. Coppa, ''The papacy, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', p. 29</ref> and veils or shawls for women. Jewish [[ghetto]]s existed in Europe for the next 315&nbsp;years.\n\nThe [[Counter-Reformation]] gained pace under his successors, the milder [[Pope Pius IV]] and the severe [[Pope Pius V|Saint Pius V]]. The former was a nepotist lover of court splendours, but more severe customs arrived anyway through the ideas of his advisor, the prelate [[Charles Borromeo]], who was to become one of the most popular figures among the Rome's people. Pius V and Borromeo gave Rome a true Counter-Reformation character. All pomp was removed from the court, the jokers were expelled, and cardinals and bishops were obliged to live in the city. Blasphemy and concubinage were severely punished. Prostitutes were expelled or confined in a reserved district. The Inquisition's power in the city was reasserted, and its palace rebuilt with an increased space for prisons. During this period Michelangelo opened the [[Porta Pia]] and turned the [[Baths of Diocletian]] into the spectacular basilica of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]], where Pius IV was buried.\n\nThe pontificate of his successor, [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], was considered a failure. As he tried to use milder measures than those of St. Pius, the worst element of the Roman population felt free to scourge again the streets. The French writer and philosopher [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] maintained that \"life and goods were never as unsure as at the time of Gregorius XIII, perhaps\", and that a confraternity even held [[same-sex marriage]] in the church of [[San Giovanni a Porta Latina]]. The courtesans repressed by Pius had now returned.\n\n[[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] was of very different temper. Although short (1585\u20131590), his reign however remembered as one of the most effective in the modern Rome's history. He was even tougher than Pius V, and was variously nicknamed ''castigamatti'' (\"punisher of the mad\"), ''papa di ferro'' (\"Iron Pope\"), ''dictator'' and even, ironically, ''demon'', since no other Pope before him pursued with such a determination the reform of the church and the customs. Sixtus profoundly reorganised the Papal States' administration, and cleaned the streets of Rome of thugs, procurers, dueling and so on. Even the nobles and Cardinals could not consider themselves free from the arms of Sixtus' police. The money from taxes, which were not now wasted in corruption, permitted an ambitious building program. Some ancient aqueducts were restored, and new one, the [[Acquedotto Felice]] (from Sixtus' name, Felice Peretti) was constructed. \nNew houses were built in the desolate district of [[Esquiline Hill|Esquilino]], [[Viminal Hill|Viminale]] and [[Quirinal Palace|Quirinale]], while old houses in the centre of the city were destroyed to open new, larger streets. \nSixtus's principal aim was to make Rome a better destination for [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]], and the new streets were intended to permit a better access to the major Basilicas. Old obelisks were moved or erected to embellish St. John in Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore and St. Peter, as well as Piazza del Popolo, in front of Santa Maria del Popolo.\n\n===Baroque period===\n[[File:Roma Piazza Navona 17c.jpg|thumb|[[Piazza Navona]] (17th century)]]\n[[File:View of Rome Roma 1688 stitched.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Rome from ''Topographia Italiae'', published by [[Matthaeus Merian]]'s heirs in 1688.]]\n\nIn the 18th century, the Papacy reached the peak of its temporal power, the Papal States including most of Central Italy, including Latium, Umbria, Marche and the Legations of Ravenna, Ferrara and Bologna extending north into the Romagna, as well as the small enclaves of Benevento and Pontecorvo in southern Italy and the larger Comtat Venaissin around Avignon in southern France.\n\n[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] architecture flourishes in Rome.  \nWork on the [[Trevi Fountain]] begins in 1732 (completed in 1762). The [[Spanish Steps]] are designed in 1735. [[Pope Clement XIII]]'s tomb by [[Canova]] is completed in 1792.\n\nThe [[Palazzo Nuovo]] becomes the world's first public museum in 1734.\n  \nSome of the most famous views of Rome in the 18th century were etched by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]].

Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"[[Roman Question]]\". The successive Popes were undisturbed in their palace, and certain prerogatives recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they [[prisoner in the Vatican|refused to leave the Vatican compound]] until the dispute was resolved in 1929. Other states continued to maintain international recognition of the Holy See as a sovereign entity.\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798), which was under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. During [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s reign, Rome was annexed into his empire and was technically part of [[France]]. After the fall of Napoleon's Empire, the Papal States were restored by the [[Congress of Vienna]],  with the exception of [[Avignon]] and the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which remained part of France.\n\nAnother [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] arose in 1849, within the framework of [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic. However, the actions of these two great men would not have resulted in unification without the sly leadership of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Camillo Benso di Cavour]], Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]].\n\nEven among those who wanted to see the peninsula unified into one country, different groups could not agree on what form a unified state would take. [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under rulership of the Pope. His book, ''Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians'', was published in 1843 and created a link between the Papacy and the Risorgimento. Many leading [[Carbonari|revolutionaries]] wanted a republic, but eventually it was a [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|king]] and his [[Count Cavour|chief minister]] who had the power to unite the Italian states as a monarchy.\n\nIn his attempt to unify Northern Italy under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], Cavour enacted major industrialisation of the country in order to become the economic leader of Italy. In doing so, he believed that the other states would naturally come under his rule. Next, he sent the army of Piedmont to the [[Crimean War]] to join the French and British. Making minor successes in the war against Russia, cordial relations were established between Piedmont-Sardinia and France; a relationship to be exploited in the future.\n[[File:Vista de Roma a partir da Bas\u00edlica de S\u00e3o Pedro.tif|thumb|Rome from the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], 1901.]]\nThe return of [[Pope Pius IX]] in Rome, with help of French troops, marked the exclusion of Rome from the unification process that was embodied in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Second Italian Independence War]] and the [[Expedition of the Thousand|''Mille'' expedition]], after which all the Italian peninsula, except Rome and [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], would be unified under the [[House of Savoy]]. Garibaldi first attacked Sicily, luckily under the guise of passing British ships and landing with little resistance.\n\nTaking the island, Garibaldi's actions were publicly denounced by Cavour but secretly encouraged via weapons supplements. This policy or real-politik, where the ends justified the means of unification, was continued as Garibaldi faced crossing the Strait of Messina. Cavour privately asked the British navy to allow Garibaldi's troops across the sea while publicly he again, denounced Garibaldi's actions. The maneuver was a success and Garibaldi's military genius carried him on to take the entire kingdom.\n\nCavour then moved to take Venetia and Lombardy via an alliance with France. The Italians and French together would attack the two states with France getting the city of Nice and the region of Savoy in return. However, the French pulled out of their agreement soon after, enraging Cavour who subsequently resigned. Only Lombardy had been captured at the time.\n\nWith French units still stationed at Rome however, Cavour, being called back to office, foresaw a possibility of Garibaldi attacking the Papal States and accidentally disrupting French-Italian relations. The army of Sardinia was therefore mobilised to attack the Papal States but remain outside Rome.\n\nIn the Austro-Prussian war however, a deal was made between the new Italy and Prussia, where Italy would attack Austria in return for the region of Venetia. The war was a major success for the Prussians (though the Italians did not win a single battle), and the northern front of Italy was complete.\n\nIn July 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] started, and French Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] could no longer protect the Papal States. Soon after, the Italian army under general [[Raffaele Cadorna]] entered Rome on 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours, through [[Porta Pia]] (see [[capture of Rome]]). The [[Leonine City]] was occupied the following day, a provisional Government Joint created by Cadorna out of local noblemen to avoid the rise of the radical factions. Rome and [[Latium]] were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] held on 2 October. 133,681 voted for annexion, 1,507 opposed (in Rome itself, there were 40,785 \"Yes\" and 57 \"No\").\n\nWhen Rome was eventually taken, the Italian government reportedly intended to let Pope Pius IX keep the part of Rome, west of the [[Tiber]], known as the [[Leonine City]] as a small remaining Papal State, but Pius IX rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom's rule over his former domain.<ref>Kertzer, p. 45.</ref> One week after entering Rome, the Italian troops had taken the entire city save for the [[Apostolic Palace]]; the inhabitants of the city then voted to join Italy.<ref>Kertzer, p. 63.</ref> On 1 July 1, 1871 Rome became the official capital of united Italy and from then until June 1929 the popes had no temporal power.\n\nThe pope referred to himself during this time as the \"[[prisoner of the Vatican]]\", although he was not actually restrained from coming and going. Pius IX took steps to ensure self-sufficiency, such as the construction of the [[Vatican Pharmacy]]. Italian nobility who owed their titles to the pope rather than the royal family became known as the [[Black Nobility]] during this period because of their purported mourning.\n\n===Kingdom of Italy===\n[[File:Porta Pia Pagliari Vizzotto.JPG|thumb|Italian soldiers [[Capture of Rome|enter Rome]] in 1870.]]\nRome became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification when the rest of Italy was reunited under the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] with a temporary capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861, Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the [[Papal States]] were under the French protection of [[Napoleon III]]. And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]].

These are continuously being excavated and opened to the public, such as the [[Colosseum]]; the [[Roman Forum]], and the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]]. There are areas with remains from [[Medieval]] times. There are palaces and artistic treasures from the [[Renaissance]]; fountains, churches and palaces from [[Baroque]] times. There is art and architecture from the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]], [[Modernist]] and [[Rationalist]] periods. There are museums, such as the [[Capitoline Museums|Musei Capitolini]], the [[Vatican Museums]], [[Galleria Borghese]].\n\nParts of the historical centre were reorganised after the 19th-century [[Italian Unification]] (1880\u20131910 \u2013 ''Roma Umbertina''). The increase of population caused by the centralisation of the Italian state necessitated new infrastructure and accommodation. There were also substantial alterations and adaptations made during the [[Fascist]] period, for example, the creation of the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; and the [[Via della Conciliazione]] in front of the Vatican. These projects involved the destruction of a large part of the old [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] neighbourhood. New [[quartieri]] were founded, such as EUR ([[Esposizione Universale Roma]]), San Basilio, Garbatella, Cinecitt\u00e0, Trullo and Quarticciolo. So great was the influx of people that on the coast, there was restructuring of [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]] and the inclusion of bordering villages such as Labaro, Osteria del Curato, Quarto Miglio, Capannelle, Pisana, Torrevecchia, Ottavia, Casalotti.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History}}\n*[[Timeline of the city of Rome]]\n*[[Timeline of Roman history]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=History of Rome\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n*{{cite book|last=Beard|first=Mary|author-link=Mary Beard (classicist)|title=SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome|year=2015|location=New York & London|publisher=Liveright Publishing|isbn=978-0-87140-423-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Raymond|title=The ancient civilization of the Etruscans|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientcivilizat00bloc|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Cowles Book|year=1969}}\n*{{Cite book|title=A history of Rome to 565 A.

Roman history can be divided into the following periods:\n\n*Pre-historical and early Rome, covering Rome's earliest inhabitants and the legend of its founding by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]].  \n*The [[Etruscan civilization|period of Etruscan dominance]] and the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal Period]], in which according to tradition, Romulus was the first of seven kings.\n*The [[Roman Republic]], which commenced in 509 BC when kings were replaced with rule by elected senators. The period was marked by vast expansion of Roman territory. During the 5th century BC, Rome gained regional dominance in [[Latium]], and eventually by the 3rd century BC.  With the [[Punic Wars]] from 264 to 146 BC, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] gained dominance over the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], displacing [[Carthage]] as the dominant regional power.\n*The [[Roman Empire]]:  With the rise of [[Julius Caesar]], the Republic waned and by all measures, concluded after a [[Final War of the Roman Republic|period of civil war]] and the victory of [[Octavian]], the adopted son of Caesar in 27 BC over [[Mark Antony]]. After the [[collapse of the Western Roman Empire]], Rome managed to hang onto the empire, still known as the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] but long centered on the eastern Mediterranean, until the 8th century as the [[Duchy of Rome]].  At this time, the city was reduced to a fraction of its former size, being sacked several times in the 5th to 6th centuries,  even temporarily depopulated entirely.<ref>Procopius, Gothic War, III.xxii. \"In Rome he suffered nothing human to remain, leaving it altogether, in every part, a perfect desert.\"</ref>\n*[[Medieval Rome]]: Characterized by a break with Byzantium and the formation of the Papal States. The Papacy struggled to retain influence in the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], and during the ''[[Saeculum obscurum]]'', the population of Rome fell to as low as 30,000 inhabitants. Following the [[East\u2013West Schism]] and the limited success in the [[Investiture Controversy]], the Papacy did gain considerable influence in high medieval Europe, but with the [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism]], the city of Rome was reduced to irrelevance, its population falling below 20,000. Rome's decline into complete irrelevance during the medieval period, with the associated lack of construction activity, assured the survival of very significant [[List of ancient monuments in Rome|ancient Roman material remains]] in the centre of the city, some abandoned and others continuing in use.\n*The [[Roman Renaissance]]: In the 15th century, Rome replaced Florence as the symbol of artistic and cultural influence.  The [[Roman Renaissance]] was cut short abruptly with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|devastation of the city]] in 1527, but the Papacy reasserted itself in the [[Counter-Reformation]], and the city continued to flourish during the early modern period. Rome was [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|annexed by Napoleon]] and was technically part of France during 1798\u20131814.\n*Modern History: The period from the 19th century to today.  Rome was under siege by the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] and was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed]] several times. It was declared an [[open city]] on 14 August 1943. Rome became the capital of the [[History of the Italian Republic|Italian Republic]] (established in 1946), with a population of 4.4 million  in its  ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}; 2.9 million within city limits)\u2014is the largest [[List of cities in Italy|city in Italy]].

The brothers argued, Romulus killed Remus, and then named the city Rome after himself. After founding and naming Rome (as the story goes), he permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens, including slaves and freemen without distinction.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8</ref> To provide his citizens with wives, Romulus invited the neighboring tribes to a festival in Rome where he abducted many of their young women (known as [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]). After the ensuing war with the [[Sabines]], Romulus shared the kingship with Sabine King [[Titus Tatius]].<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:9\u201313</ref> Romulus selected 100 of the most noble men to form the [[Roman senate]] as an advisory council to the king. These men he called patres, and their descendants became the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. He created three [[Centuria|centuries]] of [[equites]]: Ramnes (meaning Romans), Tities (after the Sabine king), and Luceres (Etruscans). He also divided the general populace into thirty [[curia]]e, named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and his \"[[The Social Contract]]\", Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. \"''There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force.''\"</ref> possibly the connection is with a root ''*rum-'', \"teat\", with a theoretical reference to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately-named twins. The Etruscan name of the city seems to have been ''Ruma''.<ref>This has been deduced from the name of a figure painted in the [[Fran\u00e7ois Tomb]] at Vulci, inscribed in Etruscan ''Cneve Tarchunies Rumach'', interpreted as Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome. http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/francois.html</ref> Compare also ''Rumon'', former name of the Tiber River. Its further etymology remains unknown, as with most Etruscan words. [[Thomas George Tucker|Thomas G. Tucker]]'s ''Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin'' (1931) suggests that the name is most probably from ''*urobsma'' (cf. ''urbs'', ''robur'') and otherwise, \"but less likely\" from ''*urosma'' \"hill\" (cf. Skt. ''varsman-'' \"height, point,\" Old Slavonic \u0432\u0440\u044c\u0445\u044a \"top, summit\", Russ. \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \"top; upward direction\", Lith. ''virsus'' \"upper\").\n\n====City's formation====\nRome grew from pastoral settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] and [[Seven hills of Rome|surrounding hills]] approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] on the south side of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]]. The [[Quirinal Hill]] was probably an outpost for the [[Sabine]]s, another [[Italic languages|Italic]]-speaking people. At this location, the Tiber forms a Z-shaped curve that contains an [[Tiber Island|island]] where the river can be forded. Because of the river and the ford, Rome was at a crossroads of traffic following the river valley and of traders traveling north and south on the west side of the [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]].\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds have confirmed that there were two fortified settlements in the 8th century BC, in the area of the future Rome: Rumi on the Palatine Hill, and Titientes on the Quirinal Hill, backed by the Luceres living in the nearby woods.<ref name=\"Ismarmed.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ismarmed.com/early.html |title=History of Rome (Italy) |last=Ismarmed.com|work=ismarmed.com |year=2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> These were simply three of numerous Italic-speaking communities that existed in [[Latium]], a [[plain]] on the [[Italy|Italian]] peninsula, by the 1st millennium BC. The origins of the [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic peoples]] lie in prehistory and are therefore not precisely known, but their [[Indo-European languages]] migrated from the east in the second half of the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nAccording to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], many Roman historians (including Porcius Cato and Gaius Sempronius) regarded the origins of the Romans (descendants of the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]]) as Greek despite the fact that their knowledge was derived from Greek legendary accounts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|authorlink=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|title=Roman Antiquities|chapter=Book 1.11|quote=But the most learned of the Roman historians, among whom is Porcius Cato, who compiled with the greatest care the \"origins\" of the Italian cities, Gaius Sempronius and a great many others, say that they [Aborigines] were Greeks, part of those who once dwelt in Achaia, and that they migrated many generations before the Trojan war. But they do not go on to indicate either the Greek tribe to which they belonged or the city from which they removed, or the date or the leader of the colony, or as the result of what turns of fortune they left their mother country; and although they are following a Greek legend, they have cited no Greek historian as their authority.

In the 8th century BC, they shared the peninsula with two other major ethnic groups: the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in the North and the [[Greeks]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (''Etrusci'' or ''Tusci'' in [[Latin]]) were settled north of Rome in [[Etruria]] (modern northern Lazio, [[Tuscany]] and part of [[Umbria]]). They founded cities such as [[Tarquinia]], [[Veii]], and [[Volterra]] and deeply influenced Roman culture, as clearly shown by the Etruscan origin of some of the mythical Roman kings. The origins of the Etruscans are lost in prehistory. Historians have no literature, no texts of religion or philosophy; therefore, much of what is known about this civilisation is derived from grave goods and tomb findings.<ref name=\"Bonfante 2006, page 9\">[[#Bonfante2006|Larissa Bonfante:''Etruscan Inscriptions and Etruscan Religion in'' The Religion of the Etruscans \u2013 University of Texas Press 2006, page 9]]</ref>\nThe behaviour of the Etruscans has led to some confusion. Like Latin, Etruscan is inflected and Hellenised. Like the Indo-Europeans, the Etruscans were patrilineal and patriarchal. Like the Italics, they were war-like. The [[gladiator]]ial displays actually developed out of Etruscan funerary customs. Future studies of Etruscan and more excavations in the region will no doubt shed more light on the origin of Rome and the Romans.<ref>According to F\u00e9lix Gaffiot's''Dictionnaire Illustr\u00e9 Latin Fran\u00e7ais'', the term Tusci was used by the major authors of the [[Roman Republic]]: [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], et al. A number of cognate words developed, including Tuscia and Tusculanensis. Tusci was clearly the principal term used to designate things Etruscan. Etrusci and Etr\u016bria were used less often, mainly by Cicero and Horace, and they lack cognates. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the English use of Etruscan dates from 1706.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=etruscan&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Greeks had founded many colonies in Southern [[Italy]] between 750 and 550&nbsp;BC (which the Romans later called [[Magna Graecia]]), such as [[Cumae]], [[Naples]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Crotone]], [[Sybaris]], and [[Taranto]], as well as in the eastern two-thirds of [[Sicily]].<ref name=\"The Story of the Greeks\">{{cite web |url=http://example.invalid |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003085828/http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage-books.php?Dir=books&MenuItem=display&author=guerber&book=greeks&story=troy |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 October 2011 |title=Heritage History eBook Reader |first=H.

Roman tradition claimed that Rome had been under the control of [[Roman Kingdom|seven kings]] from 753 to [[509\u2013500&nbsp;BC|509&nbsp;BC]] beginning with the mythical [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] who was said to have [[founding of Rome|founded the city of Rome]] along with his brother [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]]. The last three kings were said to be Etruscan (at least partially)\u2014namely [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]]. (Priscus is said by the ancient literary sources to be the son of a Greek refugee and an Etruscan mother.) Their names refer to the Etruscan town of [[Tarquinia]].\n\nThis traditional account of Roman history has come down to us through [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], and others. It claims that Rome was ruled during its first centuries by a succession of seven kings. The traditional chronology, as codified by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], allots 243&nbsp;years for their reigns, an average of almost 35&nbsp;years, which has been generally discounted by modern scholarship since the work of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]]. The [[Gauls]] destroyed much of Rome's historical records when they sacked the city after the [[Battle of the Allia]] in 390&nbsp;BC (according to Polybius, the battle occurred in 387/6) and what was left was eventually lost to time or theft. With no contemporary records of the kingdom existing, all accounts of the kings must be carefully questioned.<ref>Asimov, Isaac. Asimov's Chronology of the World. New York: HarperCollins, 1991. p. 69.</ref> The list of kings is also of dubious historical value, though the last-named kings may be historical figures.\nIt is believed by some historians (again, this is disputed) that Rome was under the influence of the Etruscans for about a century. During this period, a bridge was built called the [[Pons Sublicius]] to replace the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] ford, and the [[Cloaca Maxima]] was also built; the Etruscans are said to have been great engineers of this type of structure. From a cultural and technical point of view, Etruscans had arguably the second-greatest impact on Roman development, only surpassed by the Greeks.\n\nExpanding further south, the Etruscans came into direct contact with the Greeks and initially had success in conflicts with the Greek colonists; after which, Etruria went into a decline. Taking advantage of this, Rome rebelled and gained independence from the Etruscans around 500&nbsp;BC. It also abandoned monarchy in favour of a republican system based on a [[Roman Senate|Senate]], composed of the nobles of the city, along with popular assemblies which ensured political participation for most of the freeborn men and elected magistrates annually.\n\nThe Etruscans left a lasting influence on Rome. The Romans learned to build temples from them, and the Etruscans may have introduced the worship of a triad of gods&nbsp;\u2014 [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]], and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]&nbsp;\u2014 from the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan gods]]: [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], [[Menrva]], and [[Tinia]]. However, the influence of Etruscan people in the development of Rome is often overstated.<ref>T.J. Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', 1990, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415015967}}</ref> Rome was primarily a Latin city. It never became fully Etruscan.

After 500&nbsp;BC, Rome joined with the Latin cities in defence against incursions by the [[Sabine]]s. Winning the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 493&nbsp;BC, Rome established again the supremacy over the Latin countries it had lost after the fall of the monarchy. After a lengthy series of struggles, this supremacy became fixed in 393, when the Romans finally subdued the [[Volsci]] and [[Aequi]]. In 394&nbsp;BC, they also conquered the menacing Etruscan neighbour of [[Veii]]. The Etruscan power was now limited to Etruria itself, and Rome was the dominant city in Latium.\n\nAlso a formal treaty with the city of [[Carthage]] is reported to have been made in the end of the 6th century BC, which defined the spheres of influence of each city and regulated the trade between them.\n[[File:Roman constitution.png|thumb|right|Chart Showing the Checks and Balances of the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman Constitution]].]]\n\nAt the same time, [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] states that 4th-century Rome is a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city.<ref name=\"Krimkevich\">{{cite web |url=http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0708/IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf |title=IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf (application/pdf Object) |first=Alexander |last=Krimkevich |work=bootheprize.stanford.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004193714/http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0708/IHUM-Krimkevich.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRome's early enemies were the neighbouring hill tribes of the Volscians, the Aequi, and of course the Etruscans. As years passed and military successes increased Roman territory, new adversaries appeared. The fiercest were the [[Gauls]], a loose collective of peoples who controlled much of Northern Europe including what is modern North and Central-East Italy.\n\nIn 387&nbsp;BC, Rome was sacked and burned by the [[Senones]] coming from eastern Italy and led by [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], who had successfully defeated the Roman army at the [[Battle of the Allia]] in [[Etruria]]. Multiple contemporary records suggest that the Senones hoped to punish Rome for violating its diplomatic neutrality in Etruria. The Senones marched {{convert|130|km}} to Rome without harming the surrounding countryside; once sacked, the Senones withdrew from Rome.<ref>Ellis, \"The Celts: A History.\" pp. 61\u201364.

After 345&nbsp;BC, Rome pushed south against other Latins. Their main enemy in this quadrant were the fierce [[Samnium|Samnites]], who outsmarted and trapped the legions in 321&nbsp;BC at the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks|Battle of Caudine Forks]]. In spite of these and other temporary setbacks, the Romans advanced steadily. By 290&nbsp;BC, Rome controlled over half of the Italian peninsula. In the 3rd century BC, Rome brought the Greek [[polis|poleis]] in the south under its control as well.<ref name=\"JRank.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/6292/The-Dominance-Greece-Rome.html |title=The Dominance of Greece and Rome \u2013 polis, chora, acropolis, agora, latifundia, Atlas of the Roman World \u2013 Empire, Roman, Greek, Classical, Greeks, and Century |last=JRank.org |work=jrank.org |year=2009 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|left|Map showing Roman expansion in Italy.]]\n\nAmidst the never ending wars (from the beginning of the Republic up to the Principate, the doors of the temple of [[Janus]] were closed only twice \u2013 when they were open it meant that Rome was at war), Rome had to face a severe major social crisis, the [[Conflict of the Orders]], a political struggle between the [[plebs|Plebeian]]s (commoners) and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]]s (aristocrats) of the ancient [[Roman Republic]], in which the Plebeians sought political equality with the Patricians. It played a major role in the development of the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]]. It began in 494&nbsp;BC, when, while Rome was at war with two neighboring tribes, the Plebeians all left the city (the first [[secessio|Plebeian Secession]]). The result of this first secession was the creation of the office of [[Plebeian Tribune]], and with it the first acquisition of real power by the Plebeians.<ref name=\"Abbott, 28\">Abbott, 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of downtown Rome during the Roman Empire large.png|thumb|220px|Map of the centre of Rome during the time of the Roman Empire]]\nAccording to tradition, Rome became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] in 509&nbsp;BC. However, it took a few centuries for Rome to become the great city of popular imagination. By the 3rd century BC, Rome had become the pre-eminent city of the Italian peninsula. During the [[Punic Wars]] between Rome and the great Mediterranean empire of Carthage (264 to 146&nbsp;BC), Rome's stature increased further as it became the capital of an overseas empire for the first time. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, Rome went through a significant population expansion as Italian farmers, driven from their ancestral farmlands by the advent of massive, slave-operated farms called [[latifundium|latifundia]], flocked to the city in great numbers. The victory over Carthage in the [[First Punic War]] brought the first two provinces outside the Italian peninsula, [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name=Fields,15>{{harvnb|Fields|2007|p=15}}.</ref> Parts of [[Spain]] ([[Hispania]]) followed, and in the beginning of the 2nd century the Romans got involved in the affairs of the Greek world. By then all Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek city-states were in decline, exhausted from endless civil wars and relying on mercenary troops.\n\nThe Romans looked upon the Greek civilisation with great admiration. The Greeks saw Rome as a useful ally in their civil strifes, and it wasn't long before the Roman legions were invited to intervene in Greece. In less than 50&nbsp;years the whole of mainland Greece was subdued. The Roman legions crushed the Macedonian phalanx twice, in 197 and 168&nbsp;BC; in 146&nbsp;BC the Roman consul [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus|Lucius Mummius]] razed [[Corinth]], marking the end of free Greece. The same year [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus]], the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], destroyed the city of [[Carthage]], making it a Roman province.\n\nIn the following years, Rome continued its conquests in Spain with [[Tiberius Gracchus]], and it set foot in Asia, when the last king of [[Pergamum]] gave his kingdom to the Roman people. The end of the 2nd century brought another threat, when a great host of [[Germanic peoples]], namely [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutons|Teutones]], crossed the river Rhone and moved to Italy. [[Gaius Marius]] was consul five consecutive times (seven total), and won two decisive battles in 102 and 101&nbsp;BC He also reformed the Roman army, giving it such a good reorganization that it remained unchanged for centuries.\n\nThe first thirty years of the last century BC were characterised by serious internal problems that threatened the existence of the Republic. The [[Social War (91\u201388&nbsp;BC)|Social War]], between Rome and its allies, and the [[Roman Servile Wars|Servile Wars]] (slave uprisings) were hard conflicts,<ref>Plutarch Life of Crassus 8</ref> all within Italy, and forced the Romans to change their policy with regards to their allies and subjects.<ref>'''Smith''', ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1041.html \"Servus\", p. 1038]; details the legal and military means by which people were enslaved.</ref> By then Rome had become an extensive power, with great wealth which derived from the conquered people (as tribute, food or manpower, i.e. slaves). The allies of Rome felt bitter since they had fought by the side of the Romans, and yet they were not citizens and shared little in the rewards. Although they lost the war, they finally got what they asked, and by the beginning of the 1st century AD practically all free inhabitants of Italy were Roman citizens.\n\nHowever, the growth of the Imperium Romanum (Roman power) created new problems, and new demands, that the old political system of the Republic, with its annually elected magistrates and its sharing of power, could not solve. The dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], the extraordinary commands of Pompey Magnus, and the first [[triumvirate]] made that clear. In January 49&nbsp;BC, [[Julius Caesar]] the conqueror of Gaul, marched his legions against Rome. In the following years, he vanquished his opponents, and ruled Rome for four years. After his assassination in 44&nbsp;BC, the Senate tried to reestablish the Republic, but its champions, [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] (descendant of the founder of the republic) and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] were defeated by Caesar's lieutenant [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] and Caesar's nephew, [[Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nThe years 44\u201331&nbsp;BC mark the struggle for power between Marcus Antonius and Octavian (later known as Augustus). Finally, on 2 September 31&nbsp;BC, in the Greek promontory of [[Actium]], the final battle took place in the sea. Octavian was victorious, and became the sole ruler of Rome (and its empire). That date marks the end of the Republic and the beginning of the [[Principate]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/fallofromanrepublic_article_01.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 History \u2013 The Fall of the Roman Republic |last=BBC History |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>The Roman Republic was never restored; but nor was it abolished, so the event which signaled its transition to [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation.

Augustus's successors sought to emulate his success in part by adding their own contributions to the city. In AD 64, during the reign of [[Nero]], the [[Great Fire of Rome]] left much of the city destroyed, but in many ways it was used as an excuse for new development.<ref name=\"Tacitus, Annals XV.40\">Tacitus, ''Annals''XV.40</ref><ref name=\"Fordham\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/diocassius-nero1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Dio Cassius: Nero and the Great Fire 64 AD |last=Fordham.edu|work=fordham.edu |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nRome was a subsidised city at the time, with roughly 15 to 25 percent of its grain supply being paid by the central government. Commerce and industry played a smaller role compared to that of other cities like [[Alexandria]]. This meant that Rome had to depend upon goods and production from other parts of the Empire to sustain such a large population. This was mostly paid by taxes that were levied by the Roman government. If it had not been subsidised, Rome would have been significantly smaller.<ref>Oates, W. J. (09, June 30). Population of Rome.

His son [[Commodus]], who had been co-emperor since AD 177, assumed full imperial power, which is most generally associated with the gradual decline of the Western Roman Empire. Rome's population was only a fraction of its peak when the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian Wall]] was completed in the year 273 (in that year its population was only around 500,000).\n\n====Crisis of the Third Century====\nStarting in the early 3rd century, matters changed. The \"[[Crisis of the Third Century|Crisis of the third century]]\" defines the disasters and political troubles for the Empire, which nearly collapsed. The new feeling of danger and the menace of barbarian invasions was clearly shown by the decision of Emperor [[Aurelian]], who at year 273 finished encircling the capital itself with a massive [[Aurelian Walls|wall]] which had a perimeter that measured close to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Rome formally remained capital of the [[Roman Empire|empire]], but emperors spent less and less time there. At the end of 3rd century [[Diocletian]]'s political reforms, Rome was deprived of its traditional role of administrative capital of the Empire. Later, [[Western Roman Empire|western emperors]] ruled from [[Milan]] or [[Ravenna]], or cities in [[Gaul]]. In 330, [[Constantine I]] established a second capital at [[Constantinople]]. At this time, part of the Roman aristocratic class moved to this new centre, followed by many of the artists and craftsmen who were living in the city.\n\n====Christianization====\n{{Further|Early Christianity|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|Constantinian shift|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n\n[[Christianity]] reached Rome during the 1st century AD. For the first two centuries of the [[Christian era]], Imperial authorities largely viewed Christianity simply as a Jewish sect rather than a distinct religion. No emperor issued general laws against the faith or its Church, and persecutions, such as they were, were carried out under the authority of local government officials.<ref>Graeme Clarke, \"Third-Century Christianity,\" in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 616; W.H.C.

In spite of its increasingly marginal role in the Empire, Rome retained its historic prestige, and this period saw the last wave of construction activity: Constantine's predecessor [[Maxentius]] built buildings such as its basilica in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], Constantine himself erected the [[Arch of Constantine]] to celebrate his victory over the former, and [[Diocletian]] built the greatest [[Baths of Diocletian|baths]] of all.

The previous [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] had been accomplished by the [[Gaul]]s under their leader [[Brennus (4th century)|Brennus]] in 387&nbsp;BC. The sacking of 410 is seen as a major landmark in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. [[St. Jerome]], living in Bethlehem at the time, wrote that \"The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken.\"<ref name=Jerome127>St Jerome, Letter CXXVII. To Principia, [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VI/The Letters of St. Jerome/Letter 127]] paragraph 12.</ref> These sackings of the city astonished all the Roman world. In any case, the damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population already started to decline from the late 4th century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire, with a population of not less than 650,000 inhabitants.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> \nThe decline greatly accelerated following the capture of [[Africa Proconsularis]] by the [[Vandals]]. Many inhabitants now fled as the city no longer could be supplied with grain from Africa from the mid-5th century onward.\n\nAt the beginning of the 6th century Rome's population may have been less than 100,000. Many monuments were being destroyed by the citizens themselves, who stripped stones from closed temples and other precious buildings, and even burned statues to make lime for their personal use. In addition, most of the increasing number of churches were built in this way. For example, the [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica|first Saint Peter's Basilica]] was erected using spoils from the abandoned [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=met>{{cite journal |author= Boorsch, Suzanne |date= Winter 1982\u20131983 |title= The Building of the Vatican: The Papacy and Architecture |journal= The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume= 40 |issue= 3 |pages= 4\u20138 |ref= harv}}</ref> This architectural cannibalism was a constant feature of Roman life until the [[Renaissance]]. From the 4th century, imperial edicts against stripping of stones and especially marble were common, but the need for their repetition shows that they were ineffective. Sometimes new churches were created by simply taking advantage of early Pagan temples, while sometimes changing the Pagan god or hero to a corresponding Christian saint or martyr. In this way, the Temple of Romulus and Remus became the basilica of the twin saints [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|Cosmas and Damian]]. Later, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], Temple of All Gods, became the church of All Martyrs.\n\n====Barbarian and Byzantine restoration====\n{{further|Ostrogothic Kingdom|Duchy of Rome|Sack of Rome (546)}}\n[[File:Roma-Porta San Paolo.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Porta San Paolo]], a gate in the [[Aurelian Walls]], built between 271 AD and 275 AD.

This situation continued until [[Theodahad]] murdered [[Amalasuntha]], a pro-imperial Gothic queen, and usurped the power in 535. The [[List of Byzantine emperors|Eastern Roman emperor]], [[Justinian I]] (reigned 527\u2013565), used this as a pretext to send forces to Italy under his famed general [[Belisarius]], recapturing the city next year.

Belisarius was replaced by [[Narses]], who captured Rome from the Ostrogoths for good in 552, ending the so-called [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic Wars]] which had devastated much of Italy. The continual war around Rome in the 530s and 540s left it in a state of total disrepair \u2014 near-abandoned and desolate with much of its lower-lying parts turned into unhealthy marshes as the drainage systems were neglected and the Tiber's embankments fell into disrepair in the course of the latter half of the 6th century.<ref>P.

There is a legend, significant though untrue, that there was a moment where no one remained living in Rome. {{citation needed|reason=No source given for the legend|date=November 2014}}\n\nJustinian I provided grants for the maintenance of public buildings, aqueducts and bridges \u2014 though, being mostly drawn from an [[Italy]] dramatically impoverished by the recent wars, these were not always sufficient. He also styled himself the patron of its remaining [[scholarly method|scholar]]s, [[orator]]s, [[physician]]s and [[lawyer]]s in the stated hope that eventually more youths would seek a better [[education]]. After the wars, the Senate was theoretically restored, but under the supervision of the [[Praefectus urbi|urban prefect]] and other officials appointed by, and responsible to, the Byzantine authorities in [[Ravenna]].\n\nHowever, the Pope was now one of the leading religious figures in the entire Byzantine Empire and effectively more powerful locally than either the remaining senators or local Byzantine officials. In practice, local power in Rome devolved to the Pope and, over the next few decades, both much of the remaining possessions of the senatorial aristocracy and the local Byzantine administration in Rome were absorbed by the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nThe reign of Justinian's nephew and successor [[Justin II]] (reigned 565\u2013578) was marked from the [[Italy|Italian]] point of view by the invasion of the [[Lombards]] under [[Alboin]] (568). In capturing the regions of [[Benevento]], [[Lombardy]], [[Piedmont]], [[Spoleto]] and [[Tuscany]], the invaders effectively restricted Imperial authority to small islands of land surrounding a number of coastal cities, including [[Ravenna]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and the area of the future [[Venice]]. The one inland city continuing under Byzantine control was [[Perugia]], which provided a repeatedly threatened overland link between Rome and Ravenna. In 578 and again in 580, the Senate, in some of its last recorded acts, had to ask for the support of [[Tiberius II Constantine]] (reigned 578\u2013582) against the approaching Dukes, [[Faroald I of Spoleto]] and [[Zotto]] of [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]].\n\n[[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (reigned 582\u2013602) added a new factor in the continuing conflict by creating an alliance with [[Childebert II|Childebert II of Austrasia]] (reigned 575\u2013595). The armies of the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish King]] invaded the Lombard territories in 584, 585, 588 and 590. Rome had suffered badly from a disastrous flood of the Tiber in 589, followed by a plague in 590. The latter is notable for the [[legend]] of the [[angel]] seen, while the newly elected [[Pope Gregory I]] (term 590\u2013604) was passing in procession by [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's Tomb]], to hover over the building and to sheathe his flaming sword as a sign that the pestilence was about to cease. The city was safe from capture at least.\n\n[[Agilulf]], however, the new Lombard King (reigned 591 to c. 616), managed to secure peace with [[Childebert II|Childebert]], reorganised his territories and resumed activities against both [[Naples]] and Rome by 592. With the Emperor preoccupied with wars in the eastern borders and the various succeeding [[Exarch]]s unable to secure Rome from invasion, Gregory took personal initiative in starting negotiations for a [[peace treaty]]. This was completed in the autumn of 598\u2014later recognised by Maurice\u2014lasting until the end of his reign.\n\nThe position of the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] was further strengthened under the usurper [[Phocas]] (reigned 602\u2013610). Phocas recognised his primacy over that of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and even decreed [[Pope Boniface III]] (607) to be \"the head of all the [[Christian Church|Churches]]\". Phocas's reign saw the erection of the last imperial monument in the [[Roman Forum]], the [[column of Phocas|column]] bearing his name. He also gave the Pope the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], at the time closed for centuries, and thus probably saved it from destruction.\n\nDuring the 7th century, an influx of both Byzantine officials and churchmen from elsewhere in the empire made both the local lay aristocracy and Church leadership largely Greek speaking. The population of Rome, a magnet for pilgrims, may have increased to 90,000.<ref>[[Richard Krautheimer]], Rome, Profile of a City 312-1308, 2000 pp. 62-64 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Eleven of thirteen Popes between 678 and 752 were of Greek or Syrian descent.<ref>Krautheimer, p. 90</ref>  However, the strong Byzantine cultural influence did not always lead to political harmony between Rome and Constantinople. In the controversy over [[Monothelitism]], popes found themselves under severe pressure (sometimes amounting to physical force) when they failed to keep in step with Constantinople's shifting theological positions. In 653, [[Pope Martin I]] was deported to Constantinople and, after a show trial, exiled to the Crimea, where he died.<ref name=\"Catholic Online\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=80 |title=Pope Saint Martin I \u2013 Saints & Angels \u2013 Catholic Online |last=Catholic Online |work=catholic.org |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09723c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA: Pope Saint Martin I |last=Catholic Encyclopaedia |work=newadvent.org |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThen, in 663, Rome had its first imperial visit for two centuries, by [[Constans II]]\u2014its worst disaster since the Gothic Wars when the Emperor proceeded to strip Rome of metal, including that from buildings and statues, to provide armament materials for use against the [[Saracen]]s.

In 730 he razed the countryside of Rome to punish the Pope who had supported the duke of Spoleto.<ref name=\"Third Millennium Library I\">{{cite web |url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/MedievalHistory/The-Lombard-Kingdom/10-LAWS-OF-LIUTPRAND.html |title=THE LAWS OF LIUTPRAND. |last=Third Millennium Library |work=third-millennium-library.com |year=2010 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005105455/http://www.third-millennium-library.com/MedievalHistory/The-Lombard-Kingdom/10-LAWS-OF-LIUTPRAND.html |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nThough still protected by his massive walls, the pope could do little against the Lombard king, who managed to ally himself with the Byzantines.<ref name=\"Third Millennium Library X\">{{cite web |url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/History-of-the-Popes/TEMPORAL-SOVEREIGNTY-OF-THE-POPES/1-KING-LIUTPRAND.html |title=THE SITUATION IN THE TIME OF KING LIUTPRAND |last=Third Millennium Library |work=third-millennium-library.com |year=2010 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005105517/http://www.third-millennium-library.com/History-of-the-Popes/TEMPORAL-SOVEREIGNTY-OF-THE-POPES/1-KING-LIUTPRAND.html |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other protectors were now needed. \nGregory III was the first Pope to ask for concrete help from the Frankish Kingdom, then under the command of [[Charles Martel]] (739).<ref>from Oliver J.

He conquered [[Ferrara]] and [[Ravenna]], ending the Exarchate of Ravenna. Rome seemed his next victim. In 754, [[Pope Stephen II]] went to France to name [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Younger]], king of the [[Franks]], as ''patricius romanorum'', i.e. protector of Rome. In the August of that year the King and Pope together crossed back the Alps and defeated Aistulf at [[Pavia]]. When Pippin went back to St. Denis however, Aistulf did not keep his promises, and in 756 besieged Rome for 56&nbsp;days. The Lombards returned north when they heard news of Pippin again moving to Italy. This time he agreed to give the Pope the promised territories, and the [[Papal States]] were born.\n\nIn 771 the new King of the Lombards, [[Desiderius]], devised a plot to conquer Rome and seize [[Pope Stephen III]] during a feigned pilgrimage within its walls. His main ally was one Paulus Afiarta, chief of the Lombard party within the city. He conquered Rome in 772 but angered Charlemagne. However the plan failed, and Stephens' successor, [[Pope Adrian I|Pope Hadrian I]] called [[Charlemagne]] against Desiderius, who was finally defeated in 773.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Einhard: The Life of Charlemagne |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> The Lombard Kingdom was no more, and now Rome entered into the orbit of a new, greater political institution.\n\nNumerous remains from this period, along with a museum devoted to Medieval Rome, can be seen at [[Museo Nazionale Romano Crypta Balbi|Crypta Balbi]] in Rome.\n\n===Formation of the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{further|Papal States|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Sylvester I and Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century fresco of Sylvester and Constantine, showing the [[Donation of Constantine]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], Rome]]\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro 1450.jpg|thumb|19th-century drawing of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] as it is thought to have looked around 1450&nbsp;AD]]\n[[File:Forum temple of vespasian.jpg|thumb|From the Forum, the medieval and Renaissance Senate House stands directly upon the [[Tabularium]], ancient Rome's repository of archives.]]\n\nOn 25 April, 799 the new Pope, [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]], led the traditional procession from the [[Lateran]] to the Church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]] along the [[Via Flaminia]] (now [[Via del Corso]]). Two nobles (followers of his predecessor Hadrian) who disliked the weakness of the Pope with regards to Charlemagne, attacked the processional train and delivered a life-threatening wound to the Pope. Leo fled to the King of the Franks, and in November, 800, the King entered Rome with a strong army and a number of French bishops. He declared a judicial trial to decide if Leo III were to remain Pope, or if the deposers' claims had reasons to be upheld. This trial, however, was only a part of a well thought out chain of events which ultimately surprised the world. The Pope was declared legitimate and the attempters subsequently exiled. On 25 December, 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\nThis act forever severed the loyalty of [[Rome]] from its imperial progenitor, [[Constantinople]]. It created instead a rival empire which, after a long series of conquests by [[Charlemagne]], now encompassed most of the Christian Western territories.\n\nFollowing the death of Charlemagne, the lack of a figure with equal prestige led the new institution into disagreement. At the same time the universal [[Catholic Church|church]] of Rome had to face emergence of the lay interests of the City itself, spurred on by the conviction that the Roman people, though impoverished and abased, had again the right to elect the Western Emperor. The famous counterfeit document called the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'', prepared by the Papal notaries, guaranteed to the Pope a dominion<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/donatconst.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: The Donation of Constantine |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref>In many manuscripts, including the oldest one, which dates from the 9th century, the document bears the title ''Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris''.{{CathEncy|wstitle=Donation of Constantine}}</ref> stretching from [[Ravenna]] to [[Gaeta]]. This nominally included the suzerainty over Rome, but this was often highly disputed, and as the centuries passed, only the strongest Popes were to be able to assert it. The main element of weakness of the Papacy within the walls of the city was the continued necessity of the election of new popes, in which the emerging noble families soon managed to insert a leading role for themselves. The neighbouring powers, namely the [[Duchy of Spoleto]] and [[Tuscany|Toscana]], and later the Emperors, learned how to take their own advantage of this internal weakness, playing the role of arbiters among the contestants.\n\nRome was indeed prey of anarchy in this age. The lowest point was touched in 897, when a raging crowd [[exhume]]d the corpse of a dead pope, [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]], and [[Cadaver Synod|put it on trial]].<ref name=\"Georgia Law\">{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=fac_pm |title=The Cadaver Synod: Strangest Trial in History|first=Donald E. |last=Wilkes Jr. |work=digitalcommons.law.uga.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>\"Nor was he [[Pope Sergius III|Sergius III]] content with thus dishonouring the dead [[Pope Formosus]], but he drags his carcass again out of the grave, beheads it as if it had been alive, and then throws it into the Tiber, as unworthy the honour of human burial.\" {{Cite journal|last= Platina|first= Bartolomeo|authorlink= Bartolomeo Platina|title= The Lives of the Popes From The Time Of Our Saviour Jesus Christ to the Accession of Gregory VII|publisher= Griffith Farran & Co.|location= London|page= 243|volume= I|url= https://archive.org/details/thelivesofthepop01platuoft|accessdate=8 January 2008|ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cfpeople.org/Books/Pope/POPEp120.htm#T1|title=Sergius III|accessdate=2 January 2008|last=Brusher|first=Joseph|publisher=Neff-Kane|year=1959|journal=Popes Through the Ages|ref=harv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112051806/http://www.cfpeople.org/books/pope/POPEp120.htm#T1|archive-date=12 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last= Milman|first= Henry Hart|authorlink= Henry Hart Milman|title= History of Latin Christianity|publisher= John Murray|year= 1867|location= London|pages= 287\u2013290|volume= III|edition= 4th|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Commune===\n{{See also|Commune of Rome|14 regions of Medieval Rome}}\n\nFrom 1048 to 1257, the papacy experienced increasing conflict with the leaders and churches of the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. The latter culminated in the East-West Schism, dividing the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. From 1257 to 1377, the pope, though the bishop of Rome, resided in Viterbo, Orvieto, and Perugia, and then Avignon. The return of the popes to Rome after the Avignon Papacy was followed by the Western Schism: the division of the western church between two, and for a time three, competing papal claimants.\n\nIn this period the renovated [[Catholic Church|Church]] was again attracting pilgrims and [[prelate]]s from all the Christian world, and money with them: even with a population of only 30,000, Rome was again becoming a city of consumers dependent upon the presence of a governmental bureaucracy. In the meantime, Italian cities were acquiring increasing autonomy, mainly led by new families which were replacing the old aristocracy with a new class formed by entrepreneurs, traders and merchants. After the sack of Rome by the [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] in 1084, the rebuilding of the city was supported by powerful families such as the [[Frangipani family|Frangipane family]] and the [[Pierleoni family]], whose wealth came from commerce and banking rather than landholdings. Inspired by neighbouring cities like [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] and [[Viterbo]], Rome's people began to consider adopting a communal status and gaining a substantial amount of freedom from papal authority.\n\nLed by [[Giordano Pierleoni]], the Romans rebelled against the aristocracy and Church rule in 1143. The Senate and the Roman Republic, the [[Commune of Rome]], were born again. Through the inflammatory words of preacher [[Arnold of Brescia|Arnaldo da Brescia]], an idealistic, fierce opponent of ecclesiastical property and church interference in temporal affairs, the revolt that led to the creation of the [[Commune of Rome]] continued until it was put down in 1155, though it left its mark on the civil government of the Eternal City for centuries. 12th-century Rome, however, had little in common with the empire which had ruled over the Mediterranean some 700&nbsp;years before, and soon the new Senate had to work hard to survive, choosing an ambiguous policy of shifting its support from the Pope to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and vice versa as the political situation required. At [[Battle of Monte Porzio|Monteporzio]], in 1167, during one of these shifts, in the war with Tusculum, Roman troops were defeated by the imperial forces of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]. Luckily, the winning enemies were soon dispersed by a plague and Rome was saved.\n\n[[File:Santa Maria in Trastevere-inside.jpg|thumb|220px|Interior of the basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere, one of the most beautiful Roman churches built or re-built in the Middle Ages]]\n\nIn 1188 the new communal government was finally recognised by [[Pope Clement III]]. The Pope had to make large cash payments to the communal officials, while the 56 senators became papal vassals. The Senate always had problems in the accomplishment of its function, and various changes were tried. Often a single Senator was in charge. This sometimes led to tyrannies, which did not help the stability of the newborn organism.\n\n===Guelphs and Ghibellines===\n{{further|Guelphs and Ghibellines}}\nIn 1204 the streets of Rome were again in flames when the struggle between [[Pope Innocent III|Pope Innocent III's]] family and its rivals, the powerful [[Orsini family]], led to riots in the city. Many ancient buildings were then destroyed by machines used by the rival bands to besiege their enemies in the innumerable towers and strongholds which were a hallmark of the Middle Age Italian towns.\n\n[[File:0209tordeiconti.png|thumb|left|220px|The [[Torre dei Conti]] was one of the many towers built by the noble families of Rome to mark their power and defend themselves in the several feuds that marked the city in the Middle Ages. Only the lower third part of Torre dei Conti can be seen today.]]\n\nThe struggle between the Popes and the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], also king of [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], saw Rome support the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]]s. To repay his loyalty, Frederick sent to the commune the [[Carroccio]] he had won to the [[Lombardy|Lombards]] at the [[battle of Cortenuova]] in 1234, and which was exposed in the [[Capitoline Hill|Campidoglio]].\n\nIn that year, during another revolt against the Pope, the Romans headed by senator [[Luca Savelli]] sacked the [[Lateran]]. Curiously, Savelli was the nephew of [[Pope Honorius III]] and father of [[Pope Honorius IV|Honorius IV]], but in that age family ties often did not determine one's allegiance.\n\nRome was never to evolve into an autonomous, stable reign, as happened to other communes like [[Florence]], [[Siena]] or [[Milan]]. The endless struggles between noble families ([[Savelli family|Savelli]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]]), the ambiguous position of the Popes, the haughtiness of a population which never abandoned the dreams of their splendid past but, at the same time, thought only of immediate advantage, and the weakness of the republican institutions always deprived the city of this possibility.\n\nIn an attempt to imitate more successful communes, in 1252 the people elected a foreign Senator, the [[Bologna|Bolognese]] [[Brancaleone degli Andal\u00f2]]. In order to bring peace in the city he suppressed the most powerful nobles (destroying some 140 towers), reorganised the working classes and issued a code of laws inspired by those of northern Italy. Brancaleone was a tough figure, but died in 1258 with almost nothing of his reforms turned into reality. Five years later [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I of Anjou]], then king of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], was elected Senator. He entered the city only in 1265, but soon his presence was needed to face [[Conradin]], the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]]'s heir who was coming to claim his family's rights over southern Italy, and left the city. After June 1265 Rome was again a democratic republic, electing [[Henry of Castile the Senator|Henry of Castile]] as senator. But Conradin and the Ghibelline party were crushed in the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] (1268), and therefore Rome fell again in the hands of Charles.\n\n[[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]], a member of [[Orsini family]], was elected in 1277 and moved the seat of the [[List of popes|Popes]] from the [[Lateran Palace|Lateran]] to the more defensible [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. He also ordered that no foreigner could become senator of Rome. Being a Roman himself, he had himself elected senator by the people. With this move, the city began again to side for the papal party. In 1285 Charles was again Senator, but the [[Sicilian Vespers]] reduced his charisma, and the city was thenceforth free from his authority. The next senator was again a Roman, and again a pope, [[Pope Honorius IV|Honorius IV]] of the Savelli.\n\n===Boniface VIII and the Babylonian captivity===\nThe successor to [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]] was a Roman of the Caetani family, [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]]. Entangled in a local feud against the traditional rivals of his family, the [[Colonna family|Colonna]], at the same time he struggled to assure the universal supremacy of the [[Holy See]]. In 1300 he launched the first [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] and in 1303 founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|first University of Rome]].<ref name=\"Sapienza University\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.uniroma1.it/about/default_e.php |title=Sapienza &#62; About us |last=Sapienza University of Rome |work=www2.uniroma1.it |year=2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08531c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA: Holy Year of Jubilee |last=Catholic Encyclopaedia |work=newadvent.org |year=2009 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> The Jubilee was an important move for Rome, as it further increased its international prestige and, most of all, the city's economy was boosted by the flow of pilgrims.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\"/> Boniface died in 1303 after the humiliation of the ''[[Anagni|Schiaffo di Anagni]]'' (\"Slap of Anagni\"), which signalled instead the rule of the [[France|King of France]] over the [[Pope|Papacy]] and marked another period of decline for Rome.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia 4\"/><ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianchronicler.com/history1/avignon_papacy.html |title=THE AVIGNON PAPACY |last=ChristianChronicler.com |work=christianchronicler.com |year=2006 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoniface's successor, [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]], never entered the city, starting the so-called \"[[Avignon Papacy|Babylonian captivity]]\", the absence of the Popes from their Roman seat in favour of [[Avignon]], which would last for more than 70&nbsp;years.<ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\"/><ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.</ref> This situation brought the independence of the local powers, but these were revealed to be largely unstable; and the lack of the holy revenues caused a deep decay of Rome.<ref name=\"ChristianChronicler\"/><ref name=\"Morris\"/> For more than a century Rome had no new major buildings.

Though short-lived, his attempt is recorded by a 19th-century statue near the ramped ''[[Cordonata]]'' leading to Michelangelo's [[Capitoline Hill|Piazza del Campidoglio]].]]\n\nIn spite of its decline and the absence of the Pope, Rome had not lost its spiritual prestige: in 1341 the famous poet [[Petrarch|Petrarca]] came to the city to be crowned as [[Poet laureate]] in [[Capitoline Hill]]. Noblemen and poor people at one time demanded with one voice the return of the Pope. Among the many ambassadors that in this period took their way to [[Avignon]], emerged the bizarre but eloquent figure of [[Cola di Rienzo]]. As his personal power among the people increased by time, on 20 May 1347 he conquered the Capitoline at the head of an enthusiastic crowd. The period of his power, though very short-lived, aspired to the prestige of Ancient Rome. Now in possession of dictatorial powers, he took the title of \"tribune\", referring to the [[plebs|pleb]]'s [[tribune|magistracy]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. Cola also considered himself at an equal status of that of the Holy Roman Emperor. On 1 August, he conferred Roman citizenship on all the Italian cities, and even prepared for the election of a Roman emperor of Italy. It was too much: the Pope denounced him as heretic, criminal and pagan, the populace had begun to be disenchanted with him, while the nobles had always hated him. On 15 December, he was forced to flee.\n[[File:CasaDiColadiRienzoByRoeslerFranz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The so-called ''Casa di Rienzi'' still in its urban context before the opening of the ''Via del Mare'' in a [[watercolour]] by [[Ettore Roesler Franz]] (about 1880).]]\nIn August 1354, Cola was again a protagonist, when Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Gil Alvarez De Albornoz]] entrusted him with the role of \"senator of Rome\" in his program of reassuring the Pope's rule in the [[Papal States]]. In October the tyrannical Cola, who had become again very unpopular for his delirious behaviour and heavy bills, was killed in a riot provoked by the powerful family of the [[Colonna family|Colonna]]. In April 1355, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of [[Bohemia]] entered the city for the ritual coronation as Emperor. His visit was very disappointing for the citizens. He had little money, received the crown not from the Pope but from a Cardinal, and moved away after a few days.\n\nWith the emperor back in his lands, Albornoz could regain a certain control over the city, while remaining in his safe citadel in [[Montefiascone]], in the Northern Lazio. The senators were chosen directly by the Pope from several cities of Italy, but the city was in fact independent. The Senate council included six judges, five notaries, six marshals, several familiars, twenty knights and twenty armed men. Albornoz had heavily suppressed the traditional aristocratic families, and the \"democratic\" party felt confident enough to start an aggressive policy. In 1362 Rome declared war on [[Velletri]]. This move, however, provoked a civil war. The countryside party hired a [[condottieri]] band called \"Del Cappello\" (\"Hat\"), while the Romans bought the services of [[Germany|German]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] troops, plus a citizen levy of 600 knights and even 22,000 infantry. This was the period in which condottieri bands were active in Italy. Many of the Savelli, Orsini and Annibaldi expelled from Rome became leaders of such military units. The war with Velletri languished, and Rome again gave itself to the new Pope, [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]], provided Albornoz did not enter the walls.\n\nOn 16 October 1367, in reply to the prayers of [[Brigid of Kildare|St Brigid]] and [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Urban finally visited for the city. During his presence, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] was again crowned in the city (October 1368). In addition, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[John V Palaiologos|John V Palaeologus]] came in Rome to beg for a crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]], but in vain. However, Urban did not like the unhealthy air of the city, and on 5 September 1370 he sailed again to [[Avignon]]. His successor, [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]], officially set the date of his return to Rome at May 1372, but again the [[France|French]] cardinals and the King stopped him.\n\nOnly on 17 January 1377, Gregory XI could finally reinstate the [[Holy See]] in Rome.\n\n===Western schism and conflict with Milan===\nThe incoherent behaviour of his successor, the Italian [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], provoked in 1378 the [[Western Schism]], which impeded any true attempt of improving the conditions of the decaying Rome.\nThe 14th century, with the absence of the popes during the [[Avignon Papacy]], had been a century of neglect and misery for the city of Rome, which dropped to its lowest level of population. \nWith the return of the papacy to Rome repeatedly postponed because of the bad conditions of the city and the lack of control and security, it was first necessary to strengthen the political and doctrinal aspects of the pontiff.\n\nWhen in 1377 [[Gregory XI]] was in fact returned to Rome, he found a city in anarchy because of the struggles between the nobility and the popular faction, and in which his power was now more formal than real. There followed four decades of instability, characterised by the local power struggle between the commune and the papacy, and internationally by the great [[Western Schism]], at the end of which was elected Pope, [[Martin V]]. He restored order, laying the foundations of its rebirth.<ref>Ludovico Gatto, ''History of Rome in the Middle Ages'', Rome, Newton & Compton, 1999. {{ISBN|88-8289-273-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Lightmatter Sistine Chapel ceiling.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michelangelo]]'s ceiling in the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n\nIn 1433 the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] signed a peace treaty with [[Florence]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. He then sent the [[condottieri]] [[Niccol\u00f2 Fortebraccio]] and [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] to harass the [[Papal States]], in vengeance for [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]]'s support to the two former republics.\n\nFortebraccio, supported by the [[Colonna family|Colonna]], occupied Tivoli in October 1433 and ravaged Rome's countryside. Despite the concessions made by Eugene to the Visconti, the Milanese soldiers did not stop their destruction. This led the Romans, on 29 May 1434 to institute a Republican government under the ''Banderesi''. Eugene left the city a few days later, during the night of 4 June.\n\nHowever, the ''Banderesi'' proved incapable of governing the city, and their inadequacies and violence soon deprived them of popular support. The city was therefore returned to Eugene by the army of [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]] on 26 October 1434. After the death in mysterious circumstances of Vitelleschi, the city came under the control of [[Ludovico Scarampo]], [[List of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]]. Eugene returned to Rome on 28 September 1443.\n\n==Renaissance Rome==\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; width:300px; margin:0.5em 0 1em 1em; background:White; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"|<big><big>Rome Timeline</big></big>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"|'''Renaissance and early modern Rome'''\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"|c. 1420s\u20131519\n|style=\"font-size: 90%;\"|Rome becomes a centre of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]].

The Papacy wanted to surpass the grandeur of other Italian cities. To this end the popes created increasingly extravagant churches, bridges, town squares and public spaces, including a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] since antiquity), and [[Piazza Navona]]. The Popes were also patrons of the arts engaging such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nUnder [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became Pontiff on 19 March 1447, the [[Renaissance]] can be said to have begun in Rome, heralding a period in which the city became the centre of [[Humanism]]. He was the first Pope to embellish the Roman court with scholars and artists, including [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nOn 4 September 1449 Nicholas proclaimed a [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] for the following year, which saw a great influx of pilgrims from all Europe. The crowd was so large that in December, on [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], some 200 people died, crushed underfoot or drowned in the [[River Tiber]]. Later that year the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] reappeared in the city, and Nicholas fled.\n\n[[File:Roma1493.png|thumb|left|300px|View of Rome in 1493]]\n\nHowever Nicholas brought stability to the temporal power of the Papacy, a power in which the Emperor was to have no part at all. In this way, the coronation and the marriage of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] on 16 March 1452, was more a civil ceremony. The Papacy now controlled Rome with a strong hand. A plot by [[Stefano Porcari]], whose aim was the restoration of the Republic, was ruthlessly suppressed on January 1453. Porcari was hanged together with the other plotters, Francesco Gabadeo, Pietro de Monterotondo, Battista Sciarra and Angiolo Ronconi, but the Pope gained a treacherous reputation, as when the execution was beginning he was too drunk to confirm the grace he had previously given to Sciarra and Ronconi.\n\nNicholas was also actively involved in Rome's urban renewal, in collaboration with [[Leon Battista Alberti]], including the construction of a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]].\n[[File:St. Peter Niccoline Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|A painting from the [[Roman Renaissance]].]]\nNicholas' successor [[Pope Callixtus III|Calixtus III]] neglected Nicholas's cultural policies, instead devoting himself to his greatest passion, his nephews. The [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], who took the reins after his death in 1458, was a great Humanist, but did little for Rome. During his reign [[Lorenzo Valla]] demonstrated that the [[Donation of Constantine]] was a forgery. Pius was the first Pope to use guns, in campaign against the rebel barons Savelli in the neighbourhood of Rome, in 1461. One year later the bringing to Rome of the head of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] [[Saint Andrew|St. Andrew]] produced a great number of pilgrims. The reign of [[Pope Paul II]] (1464\u20131471) was notable only for the reintroduction of the [[Carnival]], which was to become a very popular feast in Rome in the following centuries. In the same year (1468) a plot against the Pope was uncovered, organised by the intellectuals of the [[Roman Academies|Roman Academy]] founded by [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponio Leto]]. The conspirators were sent to Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\n[[File:Roma-tempiettobramante01R.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Tempietto'' ([[San Pietro in Montorio]]), an excellent example of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture]]\n\nMore important by far was the Pontificate of [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], considered the first Pope-King of Rome. In order to favour his relative [[Girolamo Riario]], he promoted the unsuccessful [[Pazzi|Congiura dei Pazzi]] against the [[House of Medici|Medici]] of Florence (26 April 1478) and in Rome fought the [[Colonna family|Colonna]] and the [[Orsini family|Orsini]]. The personal politics of intrigue and war required much money, but in spite of this Sixtus was a true patron of art in the manner of [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]]. He reopened the Academy and reorganised the Collegio degli Abbreviatori, and in 1471 began the construction of the [[Vatican Library]], whose first curator was Platina. The Library was officially founded on 15 June 1475. He restored several churches, including [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], the [[Aqua Virgo]] and the Hospital of the Holy Spirit; paved several streets and also built a famous bridge over the [[Tiber]] river, which still bears his name. His main building project was the [[Sistine Chapel]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]]. Its decoration called on some of the most renowned artists of the age, including [[Mino da Fiesole]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Luca Signorelli]] and [[Pinturicchio]], and in the 16th century [[Michelangelo]] decorated the ceiling with his famous masterpiece, contributing to what became one of the most famous monuments of the world. Sixtus died on 12 August 1484.\n\nChaos, corruption and nepotism appeared in Rome under the reign of his successors, [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503). During the vacation period between the death of the former and the election of the latter there were 220 murders in the city. Alexander had to face [[Charles VIII of France]], who invaded Italy in 1494 and entered Rome on 31 December of that year. The Pope could only barricade himself into [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], which had been turned into a true fortress by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]]. In the end, the skilful Alexander was able to gain the support of the king, assigning his son [[Cesare Borgia]] as military counsellor for the subsequent invasion of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Rome was safe and, as the King directed himself southwards, the Pope again changed his position, joining the anti-French League of the Italian States which finally compelled Charles to flee to France.\n\nThe most nepotist Pope of all, Alexander, favoured his ruthless son Cesare, creating for him a personal [[Duchy]] out of territories of the [[Papal States]], and banning from Rome Cesare's most relentless enemy, the Orsini family. In 1500 the city hosted a new Jubilee, but grew ever more unsafe as, especially at night, the streets were controlled by bands of lawless \"bravi\". Cesare himself assassinated [[Alfonso of Bisceglie]]; as well as, presumably, the Pope's son, Giovanni of Gandia.\n\nThe Renaissance had a great impact on Rome's appearance, with works like the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartment]], all made during Innocent's reign. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the Medici family. During this twenty-year period Rome became the greatest centre of art in the world. The old [[St. Peter's Basilica]] was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the Temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican; [[Raphael]], who in Rome became the most famous painter in Italy, creating frescos in the [[Niccoline Chapel|Cappella Niccolina]], the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], and many other famous paintings. Michelangelo began the decoration of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and executed the famous statue of [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]] for the tomb of Julius. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes. Its economy was prosperous, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], a friend of Raphael and a patron of the arts. Despite his premature death, and to his eternal credit, [[Raphael]] also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins.\n\n==Early modern history==\n\n===Sack of Rome (1527)===\n[[File:Sack of Rome of 1527 by Johannes Lingelbach 17th century.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The sack of Rome'' in 1527, by [[Johannes Lingelbach]], 17th century.]]\nIn 1527 the ambiguous policy followed by the second [[House of Medici|Medici]] Pope, [[Pope Clement VII]], resulted in the dramatic [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack]] of the city by the unruly [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

The prestige of Rome was then challenged by the defections of the churches of Germany and England. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) tried to recover the situation by summoning the [[Council of Trent]]o, although being, at the same time, the most nepotist Pope of all. He even separated [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] from the [[Papal States]] to create an independent [[Duchy of Parma|duchy]] for his son [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi]].<ref name=\"Seattle Catholic\"/> He continued the patronage of art supporting the Michelangelo's ''[[Last Judgment]]'', asking him to renovate the [[Capitoline Hill|Campidoglio]] and the ongoing construction of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]]. After the shock of the sack, he also called the brilliant architect [[Giuliano da Sangallo|Giuliano da Sangallo the Younger]] to strengthen the walls of the [[Leonine City]].<ref name=\"Seattle Catholic\"/>\n\nThe need for renovation in the religious customs became evident in the vacancy period after Paulus' death, when the streets of Rome became seat of masked carousels which satirised the Cardinals attending the [[Papal conclave|conclave]].

They had to remain in the [[rioni of Rome|rione]] [[Sant'Angelo (rione of Rome)|Sant'Angelo]] and locked in at night. The Pope decreed that Jews should wear a distinctive sign, yellow hats for men<ref>Frank J. Coppa, ''The papacy, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', p. 29</ref> and veils or shawls for women. Jewish [[ghetto]]s existed in Europe for the next 315&nbsp;years.\n\nThe [[Counter-Reformation]] gained pace under his successors, the milder [[Pope Pius IV]] and the severe [[Pope Pius V|Saint Pius V]]. The former was a nepotist lover of court splendours, but more severe customs arrived anyway through the ideas of his advisor, the prelate [[Charles Borromeo]], who was to become one of the most popular figures among the Rome's people. Pius V and Borromeo gave Rome a true Counter-Reformation character. All pomp was removed from the court, the jokers were expelled, and cardinals and bishops were obliged to live in the city. Blasphemy and concubinage were severely punished. Prostitutes were expelled or confined in a reserved district. The Inquisition's power in the city was reasserted, and its palace rebuilt with an increased space for prisons. During this period Michelangelo opened the [[Porta Pia]] and turned the [[Baths of Diocletian]] into the spectacular basilica of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]], where Pius IV was buried.\n\nThe pontificate of his successor, [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], was considered a failure. As he tried to use milder measures than those of St. Pius, the worst element of the Roman population felt free to scourge again the streets. The French writer and philosopher [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] maintained that \"life and goods were never as unsure as at the time of Gregorius XIII, perhaps\", and that a confraternity even held [[same-sex marriage]] in the church of [[San Giovanni a Porta Latina]]. The courtesans repressed by Pius had now returned.\n\n[[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] was of very different temper. Although short (1585\u20131590), his reign however remembered as one of the most effective in the modern Rome's history. He was even tougher than Pius V, and was variously nicknamed ''castigamatti'' (\"punisher of the mad\"), ''papa di ferro'' (\"Iron Pope\"), ''dictator'' and even, ironically, ''demon'', since no other Pope before him pursued with such a determination the reform of the church and the customs. Sixtus profoundly reorganised the Papal States' administration, and cleaned the streets of Rome of thugs, procurers, dueling and so on. Even the nobles and Cardinals could not consider themselves free from the arms of Sixtus' police. The money from taxes, which were not now wasted in corruption, permitted an ambitious building program. Some ancient aqueducts were restored, and new one, the [[Acquedotto Felice]] (from Sixtus' name, Felice Peretti) was constructed. \nNew houses were built in the desolate district of [[Esquiline Hill|Esquilino]], [[Viminal Hill|Viminale]] and [[Quirinal Palace|Quirinale]], while old houses in the centre of the city were destroyed to open new, larger streets. \nSixtus's principal aim was to make Rome a better destination for [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]], and the new streets were intended to permit a better access to the major Basilicas. Old obelisks were moved or erected to embellish St. John in Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore and St. Peter, as well as Piazza del Popolo, in front of Santa Maria del Popolo.\n\n===Baroque period===\n[[File:Roma Piazza Navona 17c.jpg|thumb|[[Piazza Navona]] (17th century)]]\n[[File:View of Rome Roma 1688 stitched.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Rome from ''Topographia Italiae'', published by [[Matthaeus Merian]]'s heirs in 1688.]]\n\nIn the 18th century, the Papacy reached the peak of its temporal power, the Papal States including most of Central Italy, including Latium, Umbria, Marche and the Legations of Ravenna, Ferrara and Bologna extending north into the Romagna, as well as the small enclaves of Benevento and Pontecorvo in southern Italy and the larger Comtat Venaissin around Avignon in southern France.\n\n[[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] architecture flourishes in Rome.  \nWork on the [[Trevi Fountain]] begins in 1732 (completed in 1762). The [[Spanish Steps]] are designed in 1735. [[Pope Clement XIII]]'s tomb by [[Canova]] is completed in 1792.\n\nThe [[Palazzo Nuovo]] becomes the world's first public museum in 1734.\n  \nSome of the most famous views of Rome in the 18th century were etched by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]].

Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"[[Roman Question]]\". The successive Popes were undisturbed in their palace, and certain prerogatives recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they [[prisoner in the Vatican|refused to leave the Vatican compound]] until the dispute was resolved in 1929. Other states continued to maintain international recognition of the Holy See as a sovereign entity.\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798), which was under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. During [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s reign, Rome was annexed into his empire and was technically part of [[France]]. After the fall of Napoleon's Empire, the Papal States were restored by the [[Congress of Vienna]],  with the exception of [[Avignon]] and the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which remained part of France.\n\nAnother [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] arose in 1849, within the framework of [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic. However, the actions of these two great men would not have resulted in unification without the sly leadership of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Camillo Benso di Cavour]], Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]].\n\nEven among those who wanted to see the peninsula unified into one country, different groups could not agree on what form a unified state would take. [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under rulership of the Pope. His book, ''Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians'', was published in 1843 and created a link between the Papacy and the Risorgimento. Many leading [[Carbonari|revolutionaries]] wanted a republic, but eventually it was a [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|king]] and his [[Count Cavour|chief minister]] who had the power to unite the Italian states as a monarchy.\n\nIn his attempt to unify Northern Italy under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], Cavour enacted major industrialisation of the country in order to become the economic leader of Italy. In doing so, he believed that the other states would naturally come under his rule. Next, he sent the army of Piedmont to the [[Crimean War]] to join the French and British. Making minor successes in the war against Russia, cordial relations were established between Piedmont-Sardinia and France; a relationship to be exploited in the future.\n[[File:Vista de Roma a partir da Bas\u00edlica de S\u00e3o Pedro.tif|thumb|Rome from the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], 1901.]]\nThe return of [[Pope Pius IX]] in Rome, with help of French troops, marked the exclusion of Rome from the unification process that was embodied in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Second Italian Independence War]] and the [[Expedition of the Thousand|''Mille'' expedition]], after which all the Italian peninsula, except Rome and [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], would be unified under the [[House of Savoy]]. Garibaldi first attacked Sicily, luckily under the guise of passing British ships and landing with little resistance.\n\nTaking the island, Garibaldi's actions were publicly denounced by Cavour but secretly encouraged via weapons supplements. This policy or real-politik, where the ends justified the means of unification, was continued as Garibaldi faced crossing the Strait of Messina. Cavour privately asked the British navy to allow Garibaldi's troops across the sea while publicly he again, denounced Garibaldi's actions. The maneuver was a success and Garibaldi's military genius carried him on to take the entire kingdom.\n\nCavour then moved to take Venetia and Lombardy via an alliance with France. The Italians and French together would attack the two states with France getting the city of Nice and the region of Savoy in return. However, the French pulled out of their agreement soon after, enraging Cavour who subsequently resigned. Only Lombardy had been captured at the time.\n\nWith French units still stationed at Rome however, Cavour, being called back to office, foresaw a possibility of Garibaldi attacking the Papal States and accidentally disrupting French-Italian relations. The army of Sardinia was therefore mobilised to attack the Papal States but remain outside Rome.\n\nIn the Austro-Prussian war however, a deal was made between the new Italy and Prussia, where Italy would attack Austria in return for the region of Venetia. The war was a major success for the Prussians (though the Italians did not win a single battle), and the northern front of Italy was complete.\n\nIn July 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] started, and French Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] could no longer protect the Papal States. Soon after, the Italian army under general [[Raffaele Cadorna]] entered Rome on 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours, through [[Porta Pia]] (see [[capture of Rome]]). The [[Leonine City]] was occupied the following day, a provisional Government Joint created by Cadorna out of local noblemen to avoid the rise of the radical factions. Rome and [[Latium]] were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] held on 2 October. 133,681 voted for annexion, 1,507 opposed (in Rome itself, there were 40,785 \"Yes\" and 57 \"No\").\n\nWhen Rome was eventually taken, the Italian government reportedly intended to let Pope Pius IX keep the part of Rome, west of the [[Tiber]], known as the [[Leonine City]] as a small remaining Papal State, but Pius IX rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom's rule over his former domain.<ref>Kertzer, p. 45.</ref> One week after entering Rome, the Italian troops had taken the entire city save for the [[Apostolic Palace]]; the inhabitants of the city then voted to join Italy.<ref>Kertzer, p. 63.</ref> On 1 July 1, 1871 Rome became the official capital of united Italy and from then until June 1929 the popes had no temporal power.\n\nThe pope referred to himself during this time as the \"[[prisoner of the Vatican]]\", although he was not actually restrained from coming and going. Pius IX took steps to ensure self-sufficiency, such as the construction of the [[Vatican Pharmacy]]. Italian nobility who owed their titles to the pope rather than the royal family became known as the [[Black Nobility]] during this period because of their purported mourning.\n\n===Kingdom of Italy===\n[[File:Porta Pia Pagliari Vizzotto.JPG|thumb|Italian soldiers [[Capture of Rome|enter Rome]] in 1870.]]\nRome became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification when the rest of Italy was reunited under the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] with a temporary capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861, Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the [[Papal States]] were under the French protection of [[Napoleon III]]. And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. Afterwards, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself as [[prisoner in the Vatican]], and in 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPAEDIA: Pope Pius IX |last=Catholic Encyclopaedia |work=newadvent.org |year=2009 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nSoon after [[World War I]], Rome witnessed the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]] guided by [[Benito Mussolini]], who, at the request of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], [[March on Rome|marched]] on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new [[Italian Colonial Empire|Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=\"Italy at War \">{{cite web |url=http://comandosupremo.com/mussolini.html |title=Benito Mussolini &#124; Comando Supremo |last=Italy at War |work=comandosupremo.com |year=2011 |quote=Mexican revolutionary Benito Juarez, named his son after the patriot and hero.

There were some bitter fights between Italian and German troops in the south of the city and even in sight of the Colosseum, shortly after the [[armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} On 4 June 1944 Rome became the first capital city of an [[Axis powers|Axis]] nation to fall to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but was relatively undamaged because on 14 August 1943, a day after [[bombing of Rome in World War II|the last allied bombing]], the Germans declared it an \"[[open city]]\" and withdrew, meaning that the Allies did not have to fight their way in.<ref>D\u00f6ge, p. 651\u2013678</ref><ref name=\"Battle for Rome\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theboot.it/preface_open_city.htm |title=An Excerpt from The Battle for Rome: 'Open City' |first=Robert|last=Katz |work=theboot.it |year=2007 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn practice Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, they confiscated church property in many other places, including  the [[Quirinal Palace]], formerly the pope's [[official residence]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846\u201378), the last ruler of the Papal States, claimed that after Rome was annexed he was a \"[[Prisoner in the Vatican]]\".\n\n{{further|Vatican City during World War II}}\nVatican City officially pursued a policy of neutrality during [[World War II]], under the leadership of [[Pope Pius XII]]. Although the city of Rome was occupied by Germany from 1943 and the Allies from 1944, Vatican City itself was not occupied. One of Pius XII's main diplomatic priorities was to prevent the bombing of Rome; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, p. 222</ref> Before the American entry into the war, there was little impetus for such a bombing, as the British saw little strategic value in it.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222\u201332</ref>\n\nAfter the American entry, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, while the British then supported it.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232\u201336</ref> Pius XII similarly advocated for the declaration of Rome as an \"[[open city]]\", but this occurred only on 14 August 1943, after Rome had already been bombed twice.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236\u201344</ref> Although the Italians consulted the Vatican on the wording of the open city declaration, the impetus for the change had little to do with the Vatican.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244\u201345</ref>\n\n===Capital of the Italian Republic===\n[[File:Roma, vista 04 via del corso.JPG|thumb|View of [[Via del Corso]] (2008)]]\n[[File:Veduta Aerea EUR 1.jpg|thumb|View of the [[EUR, Rome|EUR district]] (2003)]]\nRome grew substantially after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation. It became a fashionable city in the 1950s and early 1960s, the years of \"la dolce vita\" (\"the sweet life\"), with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053779/|title=La Dolce Vita (1960) |publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> being filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] Studios.\n\nA new rising trend in population continued until the mid-1980s, when the commune had more than 2.8 million residents; after that, population started to slowly decline as more residents moved to nearby suburbs. The [[Rome metropolitan area]] has about 4.4 million inhabitants {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.\n\nBeing the capital city of Italy, all the principal institutions of the nation are located there, including the President; the seat of government with its single Ministeri; the Parliament; the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives for both Italy and the Vatican City. \nA number of notable international cultural, scientific and humanitarian institutions are located in Rome, including the [[German Archaeological Institute]], and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]].\n\nRome hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues.<ref name=\"Olympic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/rome-1960-summer-olympics |title=rome 1960 Summer Olympics &#124; Olympic Videos, Photos, News |last=Olympic.org.

The historical centre, identified as those parts within the limits of the ancient Imperial walls, contains archaeological remains from Ancient Rome. These are continuously being excavated and opened to the public, such as the [[Colosseum]]; the [[Roman Forum]], and the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]]. There are areas with remains from [[Medieval]] times. There are palaces and artistic treasures from the [[Renaissance]]; fountains, churches and palaces from [[Baroque]] times. There is art and architecture from the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]], [[Modernist]] and [[Rationalist]] periods. There are museums, such as the [[Capitoline Museums|Musei Capitolini]], the [[Vatican Museums]], [[Galleria Borghese]].\n\nParts of the historical centre were reorganised after the 19th-century [[Italian Unification]] (1880\u20131910 \u2013 ''Roma Umbertina''). The increase of population caused by the centralisation of the Italian state necessitated new infrastructure and accommodation. There were also substantial alterations and adaptations made during the [[Fascist]] period, for example, the creation of the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; and the [[Via della Conciliazione]] in front of the Vatican. These projects involved the destruction of a large part of the old [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] neighbourhood. New [[quartieri]] were founded, such as EUR ([[Esposizione Universale Roma]]), San Basilio, Garbatella, Cinecitt\u00e0, Trullo and Quarticciolo. So great was the influx of people that on the coast, there was restructuring of [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]] and the inclusion of bordering villages such as Labaro, Osteria del Curato, Quarto Miglio, Capannelle, Pisana, Torrevecchia, Ottavia, Casalotti.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History}}\n*[[Timeline of the city of Rome]]\n*[[Timeline of Roman history]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=History of Rome\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n*{{cite book|last=Beard|first=Mary|author-link=Mary Beard (classicist)|title=SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome|year=2015|location=New York & London|publisher=Liveright Publishing|isbn=978-0-87140-423-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Raymond|title=The ancient civilization of the Etruscans|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientcivilizat00bloc|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Cowles Book|year=1969}}\n*{{Cite book|title=A history of Rome to 565 A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:\n\n{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer.

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.
