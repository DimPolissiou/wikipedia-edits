All flights, in small aircraft, to and from [[Iloilo]] and [[Cebu]] cities by the national flag carrier [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) that were previously operating in the old and smaller Buayan Airport has since then landed and departed in this new and far better airport facility.  On the first few weeks of operation of the new airport, PAL has initially deployed its [[Boeing 737-300]] aircraft to serve its special direct flights to and from the capital to serve the travel needs for the ongoing [[Palarong Pambansa]] sports event being held during the time. As before there were no direct flights going to and from the capital to this city because PAL couldn't utilize its wider body and long range aircraft to safely land and take off in the city's old and smaller Buayan Airport. During then, there were only two options for air travelers to get to [[Manila]] by air from General Santos and vice versa and that there's not much of a choice but to go through the ordeal.  One, is to take and wait for a connecting flight to [[Manila]] upon arrival in [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] and second, is to take a tiresome and lengthy 4-hour travel by land to [[Davao City]] just to catch a direct flight to [[Manila]].\n[[File:General Santos International Airport.jpg|200px|thumb|A General Santos International Airport]]\nIn a few months time PAL commenced regular thrice weekly direct flights to and from [[Manila]] using a bigger and wider [[Airbus A300-B4]] aircraft. Later this became five times weekly in November 1996. And four months after its launch, a daily service was in effect in December 1997 while maintaining its existing regular frequencies to and from [[Iloilo]] and [[Cebu]] cities using smaller [[Fokker 50]] aircraft. The airline's initiative to commence a direct flight to and from the capital has helped pave the way to continually increase not only the air passenger traffic that are coming in and out of city's very own airport but as well as air cargo traffic which is indicative of the city's vibrant tuna export industry and fast growing economy in general. However, PAL's financial difficulties in the late 90s forced the halting of its [[Iloilo]] and [[Cebu]] routes out of General Santos International Airport in 1998, leaving PAL with only its single daily frequency to and from Manila to operate in the airport. In 1997, [[Air Philippines]] (now [[Airphil Express]]) commenced its daily Manila\u2013General Santos\u2013Manila flight using [[Boeing 737-200]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-88]] aircraft.\n\nThe first international chartered flight to land in General Santos International Airport was of former [[President Fidel V. Ramos]]' homecoming from one of his state visits abroad in the mid 90s. Aboard PAL's [[Airbus A340]] aircraft, the president and his party landed in General Santos International Airport directly from [[Bangkok]]. In November 2003, international flights to and from [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]] were also briefly operational on a regular weekly frequency to this city by an Indonesian carrier [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3287281/GENERAL-SANTOS-TRADERS-BULLISH-ON.html] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref> using [[Fokker 70]] aircraft. PAL has also disclosed plans of commencing international flights to and from [[General Santos City]] in the late 90s.\n\n[[Cebu Pacific]], currently the country's largest low-cost carrier, finally commenced daily flights to and from Manila on October 2, 2006, initially deploying [[Airbus A319]] aircraft. This was later upgraded to [[Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A330]] and is being used up till the present time.\n\n[[File:GES terminal building.jpg|250px|thumb|Terminal building of Gen San Airport]]\nHaving a runway length of 3,227 meters and a runway width of 45 meters,<ref name=\"Airport Information\">[http://caap.gov.ph/web/airportsTambler.htm Airport Information], [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]], retrieved August 5, 2010</ref> General Santos International Airport has the country's third longest runway\u2014to date\u2014after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in Manila and [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] in [[Cebu]].

The airline's initiative to commence a direct flight to and from the capital has helped pave the way to continually increase not only the air passenger traffic that are coming in and out of city's very own airport but as well as air cargo traffic which is indicative of the city's vibrant tuna export industry and fast growing economy in general. However, PAL's financial difficulties in the late 90s forced the halting of its [[Iloilo]] and [[Cebu]] routes out of General Santos International Airport in 1998, leaving PAL with only its single daily frequency to and from Manila to operate in the airport. In 1997, [[Air Philippines]] (now [[Airphil Express]]) commenced its daily Manila\u2013General Santos\u2013Manila flight using [[Boeing 737-200]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-88]] aircraft.\n\nThe first international chartered flight to land in General Santos International Airport was of former [[President Fidel V. Ramos]]' homecoming from one of his state visits abroad in the mid 90s. Aboard PAL's [[Airbus A340]] aircraft, the president and his party landed in General Santos International Airport directly from [[Bangkok]]. In November 2003, international flights to and from [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]] were also briefly operational on a regular weekly frequency to this city by an Indonesian carrier [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3287281/GENERAL-SANTOS-TRADERS-BULLISH-ON.html] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref> using [[Fokker 70]] aircraft. PAL has also disclosed plans of commencing international flights to and from [[General Santos City]] in the late 90s.\n\n[[Cebu Pacific]], currently the country's largest low-cost carrier, finally commenced daily flights to and from Manila on October 2, 2006, initially deploying [[Airbus A319]] aircraft. This was later upgraded to [[Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A330]] and is being used up till the present time.\n\n[[File:GES terminal building.jpg|250px|thumb|Terminal building of Gen San Airport]]\nHaving a runway length of 3,227 meters and a runway width of 45 meters,<ref name=\"Airport Information\">[http://caap.gov.ph/web/airportsTambler.htm Airport Information], [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]], retrieved August 5, 2010</ref> General Santos International Airport has the country's third longest runway\u2014to date\u2014after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in Manila and [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] in [[Cebu]].

Although Renner was not associated with the [[Bauhaus]], he shared many of its idioms and believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach of most previous sans-serif designs (now often called [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|grotesque]]s), which were based on the models of signpainting, condensed lettering and nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of near-even weight, which are low in contrast. The lowercase has tall ascenders, which rise above the cap line, and uses nearly-circular, single-story forms for the \"a\" and \"g\", the former previously more common in handwriting than in printed text.{{efn|It was, though, not the first sans-serif with these features: Koralle, for instance, already used a single-story 'a', and the form is standard in [[blackletter]].<ref name=\"Koralle\">{{cite web|title=Koralle|url=https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/45168/koralle|website=Fonts in Use|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref>}} The uppercase characters present proportions similar to those of classical [[Roman square capitals|Roman capitals]].<ref name=\"Types of their time \u2013 A short history of the geometric sans\">{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=Ferdinand|title=Types of their time \u2013 A short history of the geometric sans|url=https://www.fontshop.com/content/short-intro-to-geometric-sans|publisher=FontShop|access-date=19 August 2015}}</ref> The original metal type showed extensive adaptation of the design to individual sizes, and several divergent digitisations have been released by different companies.<ref name=\"Burke1998 manufacturing\" /><ref name=\"Coles' Comments on Quora\" />\n\nFutura was extensively marketed by Bauer and its American distribution arm by brochure as capturing the spirit of modernity, using the German slogan ''\"die Schrift unserer Zeit\"'' (\"the typeface of our time\") and in English ''\"the typeface of today and tomorrow\"''.<ref name=\"Futura: The Typeface of Today and Tomorrow\">{{cite web|last1=Rhatigan|first1=Dan|title=Futura: The Typeface of Today and Tomorrow|url=http://ultrasparky.org/archives/2014/01/futura_the_type.html|website=Ultrasparky|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Aynsley\">{{cite book|last1=Aynsley|first1=Jeremy|title=Graphic Design in Germany: 1890-1945|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520227965|pages=102\u20135}}</ref> It has remained popular since.<ref name=\"Shaw2017\" /><ref name=\"Handover Monotype\">{{cite journal|last1=Handover|first1=Phyllis Margaret|author-link=P.

It spawned a range of derivative geometric sans-serif typefaces from competing foundries, particularly in the United States.\n\nIn the UK Futura, while sometimes used, was overshadowed by [[Gill Sans]], which became popular for similar reasons in the UK and came to define 1930s and 1940s printing. While more humanist, it also has geometric leanings which are particularly visible in the capitals.\n\nAt a time when Hitler and Nazi Germany ideologies were on the rise, typefaces were a strong indicator of culture and national identity. Roman typefaces were rising in popularity, and they were becoming the standard text for printed documents when previously, German Blackletter was the default style. As a way to hold on to German identity, the Germans pushed for the use of Blackletter typefaces over Roman.\n\nWhen the Nazi regime rose into power in 1933, they utilized Blackletter typefaces to further promote German national identity. They determined Fraktur to be the true German type. They rejected modern type styles like Futura, which went on to become popular throughout the world, influenced by the Bauhaus and the English Arts and Crafts Movements. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/german-design-fraktur-and-the-psychology-of-type/23583466.html|title=German design: Fraktur and the psychology of type|website=www.handelsblatt.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nFutura made appearances on Nazi documentation, such as the \"Organisationsbuch der NSDAP\u201d, an informational handbook about membership to the Nazi Party and posters promoting \u201cEntartete Kunst\u201d (Degenerate Art), the exhibition that was created by the Nazis to shame modern art. In 1941, the Nazi regime deemed blackletter typefaces to have Jewish heritage due to the Nazi\u2019s perception of the typeface looking too similar to Hebrew, and therefore banned Fraktur and any other traditional German handwriting. Roman typography, which included Futura, became the new standard due to its superior legibility over blackletter typography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://designobserver.com/feature/never-use-futura/39698|title=Never Use Futura|website=Design Observer|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Futura oblique Le Bretagne specimen.jpg|thumb|An early American metal type specimen sheet of Futura Oblique.

It is used for the title logo of the 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. It was also used in various TV shows including ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Warehouse 13]]'', the American version of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', which had the capital \"I\", lowercase \"j\", and numbers \"1\" and \"4\" in simplified forms, etc.  Futura is featured ubiquitously throughout the film adaptation of ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', for everything from the title logo and ending credits, to signs, newspapers, computer screens and other props. [[Wes Anderson]] is fond of the font and used it in some of his films. Futura was also [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s favorite typeface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/27/features.weekend | title=Citizen Kubrick | first=Jon | last=Ronson |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2004}}</ref>\n\nTransport is another important area where Futura has been used extensively due to its ability to be read quickly from a distance; it can be found extensively in the instrument panel graphics within [[automobile]]s&nbsp;\u2014 [[Mercedes-Benz]] being one of the most prolific users of the font.  Futura is used extensively in aviation for instruments and control legends&nbsp;\u2014 most [[Boeing]] airliners use Futura within their cockpit controls, for example. [[NASA]] used Futura frequently during the Apollo space program, with charts, technical documents, and spacecraft instrumentation labels all making use of the typeface.\n\nCrockett Johnson used Futura for the lettering of his ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'' comic strip, which started running in April 1942 in the newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''. Where many cartoonists lettered their dialogues by hand, Johnson collaborated with the ''PM'' typesetters who would set his dialogues in italicized Futura medium and return them to him so that they could be integrated to his drawings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nel |first1=Philip |title=Crockett Johnson and the Invention of Barnaby |url=http://www.tcj.com/crockett-johnson-and-the-invention-of-barnaby/ |website=The Comics Journal |publisher=Fantagraphics |accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[NBC]] used a modified version of Futura for its original 1986 version of the current logo and its wordmarks.<ref>https://create.adobe.com/2017/8/25/what_you_can_learn_from_the_evolution_of_the_nbc_logo_.html</ref> \nA bold version of the font was used for [[NBC Sports]] on-screen graphics from 1989 to 1991, and by [[CBS Sports]] from 1992 to 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (an [[American football]] team) switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on their helmets.

The [[Boston Celtics]]' championship banners are also in Futura Condensed. 2008 [[science fiction]]-[[fantasy]] film ''[[City of Ember]]'' features Futura Medium in many prints through the story. The condensed version was used by videogame developer [[Bethesda Softworks]] for several of their games, including ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'' as well as being used extensively throughout the ''[[Watchmen]]'' graphic novel as well as the movie based on it. The Medium version is a font used predominantly alongside the Stratum 2 font in the 2014 racing video game ''[[Driveclub]]''. In season 2 of ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', episode \"Common Descent&nbsp;\u2013 Part 1\" the ancestors of the crew state that one of the two continents was named \"Futura\". There are several references to the name being a font in the episode.  Futura also served as the typeface for UK television series ''[[Utopia (UK TV series)|Utopia]]''{{'}}s title cards, coloured white upon a neon yellow background (neon green in season two).\n\n[[University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]] signage uses Futura. \n\nMore recently, Futura has seen widespread use in many films and video games; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'' both use Futura on their covers, with ''Wolfenstein'' using the font throughout the in-game menus also. The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' and 2014 films ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' and '' [[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' also use Futura on their theatrical release posters. Futura is used in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Location Cards.

A slimmer variant seems to have been used by the [[Canadian Tire Corporation]] in their wordmark and logo.\n\n===Futura Black===\n[[File:Futura Black type specimen.jpg|thumb|A metal type specimen of Futura Black]]\nFirst released in 1929, Futura Black is an alternative design that uses stencil letter forms.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite news|url=https://bauertypes.com/tipografia/futura-nd-black/|title=Futura ND Black - BauerTypes|work=BauerTypes|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Example uses of the font include the public safety departments of the city of [[Boston]], the \"R\" logo of the [[National Association of Realtors]], title sequences of television programs such as ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'', and as the wordmark for the [[National Football League]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] from 1982 to 2003. The movie logo for the 2020 James Bond film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' also uses Futura Black.\n\n===Steile Futura===\nSteile Futura was Paul Renner's attempt to create a typeface that would be closer to the nineteenth century sans serifs than to the geometric model. During the course of development, Renner developed several intermediate versions. Some of the early design could be found in the experimental font called Renner-Grotesk, which appeared as a trial type casting from the Stempel type foundry in 1936. Renner kursiv, a true italic companion to the regular version, was made after Stempel had been taken over by Bauer in 1938.\n\nThe work on the type family continued in the 1940s, but Renner's poor health had slowed down the development. Renner started to work again on this project in 1951 under the name of Steile Futura (''steil'' in German means \"upright\" or \"steep\").\n\nThe font family released by Bauer consist of mager (light), halbfett (medium), fett (bold), kursiv halbfett (medium italic), and kursiv fett (bold italic). The font family was released in 1952\u20131953. It was sold by Bauer in German, English, Spanish, and French markets as Steile Futura, Bauer Topic, Vox, Z\u00e9nith respectively.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219083120/http://mitja-m.com/writings/steile_futura.htm About Steile Futura]. ''Mitja-m.com''.</ref>\n\nThe font family has rounder letters than Futura Display. For the first time, italic type features are incorporated in the italic fonts. The fonts incorporate handwriting features, especially in italic version. URW and Berthold have released digitisations, URW's under the name of \"Topic\", its name in original release in some non-German speaking countries.<ref name=\"Steile Futura Bold BQ\">{{cite web|title=Steile Futura BQ|url=http://www.linotype.com/261424/SteileFuturaBQ-family.html|website=Linotype|publisher=Berthold|access-date=1 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331201047/http://www.linotype.com/261424/SteileFuturaBQ-family.html|archivedate=31 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"URW Topic\">{{cite web|title=URW Topic|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/topic/|website=[[MyFonts]]|publisher=[[URW++]]|access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref> [[Tasse]] by [[Font Bureau]] is a loose adaptation.<ref name=\"Tasse\">{{cite web|title=Tasse|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Tasse|website=[[Font Bureau]]|access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Futura Inline===\n[[File:Futura Inline.jpg|thumb|right|Sample of the font Futura Inline in metal type.]]\nAn \"[[Typeface#Effect typefaces|inline]]\" version with a line drawn through each letter.\n\n==Digitisations==\n[[File:Futura comparison.jpg|thumb|left|A comparison of Futura weights in digital format.]]\nWith the demise of [[hot metal typesetting]], Futura has been redrawn in digital formats. Because of complex licensing agreements, there is no one digital version of Futura but several, each with different features. (Some releases may be re-drawings or upgraded versions of earlier digital releases.) Releases of Futura exist from Linotype, Bitstream, [[URW++]] (several), [[Elsner+Flake]] and many others under that name, and by many other companies under others because of rights issues. For example, Fontsite's (including Futura Black and Poster) is renamed as 'Function'.<ref name=\"Function Pro\">{{cite web|title=Function Pro|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-pro|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Function Deco\">{{cite web|title=Function Deco|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-deco|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Function Display\">{{cite web|title=Function Display|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-display|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs with all metal type revivals, converting Futura into a digital format poses interpretative challenges. Metal type fonts could be made differently for each text size, so a variety of metal and phototype versions of Futura exist on which a revival could potentially be based. In addition, revivals will need to add characters not present in the original Futura like the Euro sign and Cyrillic, and therefore do not all have the same character set.\n\nFutura revivals may also decide to make design changes, like replacing Futura\u2019s straight 'j' with a more conventional substitute as URW's revival does. Scangraphic's revival notably includes [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]], with a tighter-spaced design (SH) created for headlines and a more spread-out version (SB) for body text sizes.<ref name=\"Futura SH\">{{cite web|title=Futura SH|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Scangraphic|access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Futura SB\">{{cite web|title=Futura SB|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sb/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Scangraphic|access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref> As an assessment of the decisions involved, a wide-ranging review by Stephen Coles of digitisations of Futura and its competitor geometrics noted that Bitstream's \"abandons some of the strict geometry in favour of a more harmonious whole, but it may not be the Futura you were expecting,\" and that URW's Futura Nr. 2 was \"Possibly optimized for small text: it\u2019s wider, ascenders shorter, counters larger, and apertures more open.

Although Renner was not associated with the [[Bauhaus]], he shared many of its idioms and believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach of most previous sans-serif designs (now often called [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|grotesque]]s), which were based on the models of signpainting, condensed lettering and nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of near-even weight, which are low in contrast.

It spawned a range of derivative geometric sans-serif typefaces from competing foundries, particularly in the United States.\n\nIn the UK Futura, while sometimes used, was overshadowed by [[Gill Sans]], which became popular for similar reasons in the UK and came to define 1930s and 1940s printing. While more humanist, it also has geometric leanings which are particularly visible in the capitals.\n\nAt a time when Hitler and Nazi Germany ideologies were on the rise, typefaces were a strong indicator of culture and national identity. Roman typefaces were rising in popularity, and they were becoming the standard text for printed documents when previously, German Blackletter was the default style. As a way to hold on to German identity, the Germans pushed for the use of Blackletter typefaces over Roman.\n\nWhen the Nazi regime rose into power in 1933, they utilized Blackletter typefaces to further promote German national identity. They determined Fraktur to be the true German type. They rejected modern type styles like Futura, which went on to become popular throughout the world, influenced by the Bauhaus and the English Arts and Crafts Movements. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/german-design-fraktur-and-the-psychology-of-type/23583466.html|title=German design: Fraktur and the psychology of type|website=www.handelsblatt.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nFutura made appearances on Nazi documentation, such as the \"Organisationsbuch der NSDAP\u201d, an informational handbook about membership to the Nazi Party and posters promoting \u201cEntartete Kunst\u201d (Degenerate Art), the exhibition that was created by the Nazis to shame modern art. In 1941, the Nazi regime deemed blackletter typefaces to have Jewish heritage due to the Nazi\u2019s perception of the typeface looking too similar to Hebrew, and therefore banned Fraktur and any other traditional German handwriting. Roman typography, which included Futura, became the new standard due to its superior legibility over blackletter typography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://designobserver.com/feature/never-use-futura/39698|title=Never Use Futura|website=Design Observer|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Futura oblique Le Bretagne specimen.jpg|thumb|An early American metal type specimen sheet of Futura Oblique.

It is used for the title logo of the 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. It was also used in various TV shows including ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Warehouse 13]]'', the American version of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', which had the capital \"I\", lowercase \"j\", and numbers \"1\" and \"4\" in simplified forms, etc.  Futura is featured ubiquitously throughout the film adaptation of ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', for everything from the title logo and ending credits, to signs, newspapers, computer screens and other props. [[Wes Anderson]] is fond of the font and used it in some of his films. Futura was also [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s favorite typeface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/27/features.weekend | title=Citizen Kubrick | first=Jon | last=Ronson |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2004}}</ref>\n\nTransport is another important area where Futura has been used extensively due to its ability to be read quickly from a distance; it can be found extensively in the instrument panel graphics within [[automobile]]s&nbsp;\u2014 [[Mercedes-Benz]] being one of the most prolific users of the font.  Futura is used extensively in aviation for instruments and control legends&nbsp;\u2014 most [[Boeing]] airliners use Futura within their cockpit controls, for example. [[NASA]] used Futura frequently during the Apollo space program, with charts, technical documents, and spacecraft instrumentation labels all making use of the typeface.\n\nCrockett Johnson used Futura for the lettering of his ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'' comic strip, which started running in April 1942 in the newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''.

All four of [[Vampire Weekend]]'s albums use Futura on the covers, with the first two being exclusively Futura. The [[Boston Celtics]]' championship banners are also in Futura Condensed. 2008 [[science fiction]]-[[fantasy]] film ''[[City of Ember]]'' features Futura Medium in many prints through the story. The condensed version was used by videogame developer [[Bethesda Softworks]] for several of their games, including ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'' as well as being used extensively throughout the ''[[Watchmen]]'' graphic novel as well as the movie based on it. The Medium version is a font used predominantly alongside the Stratum 2 font in the 2014 racing video game ''[[Driveclub]]''. In season 2 of ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', episode \"Common Descent&nbsp;\u2013 Part 1\" the ancestors of the crew state that one of the two continents was named \"Futura\". There are several references to the name being a font in the episode.  Futura also served as the typeface for UK television series ''[[Utopia (UK TV series)|Utopia]]''{{'}}s title cards, coloured white upon a neon yellow background (neon green in season two).\n\n[[University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]] signage uses Futura. \n\nMore recently, Futura has seen widespread use in many films and video games; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'' both use Futura on their covers, with ''Wolfenstein'' using the font throughout the in-game menus also. The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' and 2014 films ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' and '' [[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' also use Futura on their theatrical release posters. Futura is used in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Location Cards.

Bold and bold oblique fonts were released in 1930. Medium, medium oblique, extra bold, and extra bold oblique fonts were released in 1936. Light and light oblique fonts were released in 1950.\n\n===Futura Demibold===\nFutura Demibold is a variation of the original Futura.<ref>{{cite web|title=Futura Demibold|website=Fonts.com|url=https://www.fonts.com/font/elsner-flake/ef-futura/demi-bold}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Futura Demibold|website=Abstractfonts.com|url=http://www.abstractfonts.com/search/futura+demi+bold}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Futura Demibold|website=Type.co.uk|url=http://www.type.co.uk/a_to_z/id/37054}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fontshop.com/families/neufville-futura/demibold|website=Fontshop.com|title=Futura Demibold}}</ref>\n\n===Futura Display (Futura Schlagzeile)===\n[[File:Futura Display.jpg|thumb|left|Futura Display in a specimen book.]]\nReleased in 1932, Futura Display uses more angular strokes, resulting in rectangular letter forms.\n\nThis is also the font used on the covers of the classic Region 2 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' DVD covers, and was used on the covers of most ''[[Star Trek]]'' novels published by [[Pocket Books]] during the 1980's. A slimmer variant seems to have been used by the [[Canadian Tire Corporation]] in their wordmark and logo.\n\n===Futura Black===\n[[File:Futura Black type specimen.jpg|thumb|A metal type specimen of Futura Black]]\nFirst released in 1929, Futura Black is an alternative design that uses stencil letter forms.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite news|url=https://bauertypes.com/tipografia/futura-nd-black/|title=Futura ND Black - BauerTypes|work=BauerTypes|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Example uses of the font include the public safety departments of the city of [[Boston]], the \"R\" logo of the [[National Association of Realtors]], title sequences of television programs such as ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'', and as the wordmark for the [[National Football League]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]] from 1982 to 2003. The movie logo for the 2020 James Bond film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' also uses Futura Black.\n\n===Steile Futura===\nSteile Futura was Paul Renner's attempt to create a typeface that would be closer to the nineteenth century sans serifs than to the geometric model. During the course of development, Renner developed several intermediate versions. Some of the early design could be found in the experimental font called Renner-Grotesk, which appeared as a trial type casting from the Stempel type foundry in 1936. Renner kursiv, a true italic companion to the regular version, was made after Stempel had been taken over by Bauer in 1938.\n\nThe work on the type family continued in the 1940s, but Renner's poor health had slowed down the development. Renner started to work again on this project in 1951 under the name of Steile Futura (''steil'' in German means \"upright\" or \"steep\").\n\nThe font family released by Bauer consist of mager (light), halbfett (medium), fett (bold), kursiv halbfett (medium italic), and kursiv fett (bold italic). The font family was released in 1952\u20131953. It was sold by Bauer in German, English, Spanish, and French markets as Steile Futura, Bauer Topic, Vox, Z\u00e9nith respectively.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219083120/http://mitja-m.com/writings/steile_futura.htm About Steile Futura]. ''Mitja-m.com''.</ref>\n\nThe font family has rounder letters than Futura Display. For the first time, italic type features are incorporated in the italic fonts. The fonts incorporate handwriting features, especially in italic version. URW and Berthold have released digitisations, URW's under the name of \"Topic\", its name in original release in some non-German speaking countries.<ref name=\"Steile Futura Bold BQ\">{{cite web|title=Steile Futura BQ|url=http://www.linotype.com/261424/SteileFuturaBQ-family.html|website=Linotype|publisher=Berthold|access-date=1 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331201047/http://www.linotype.com/261424/SteileFuturaBQ-family.html|archivedate=31 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"URW Topic\">{{cite web|title=URW Topic|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/topic/|website=[[MyFonts]]|publisher=[[URW++]]|access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref> [[Tasse]] by [[Font Bureau]] is a loose adaptation.<ref name=\"Tasse\">{{cite web|title=Tasse|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Tasse|website=[[Font Bureau]]|access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Futura Inline===\n[[File:Futura Inline.jpg|thumb|right|Sample of the font Futura Inline in metal type.]]\nAn \"[[Typeface#Effect typefaces|inline]]\" version with a line drawn through each letter.\n\n==Digitisations==\n[[File:Futura comparison.jpg|thumb|left|A comparison of Futura weights in digital format.]]\nWith the demise of [[hot metal typesetting]], Futura has been redrawn in digital formats. Because of complex licensing agreements, there is no one digital version of Futura but several, each with different features. (Some releases may be re-drawings or upgraded versions of earlier digital releases.) Releases of Futura exist from Linotype, Bitstream, [[URW++]] (several), [[Elsner+Flake]] and many others under that name, and by many other companies under others because of rights issues. For example, Fontsite's (including Futura Black and Poster) is renamed as 'Function'.<ref name=\"Function Pro\">{{cite web|title=Function Pro|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-pro|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Function Deco\">{{cite web|title=Function Deco|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-deco|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Function Display\">{{cite web|title=Function Display|url=http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/function-display|website=Fontspring|publisher=Fontsite|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs with all metal type revivals, converting Futura into a digital format poses interpretative challenges. Metal type fonts could be made differently for each text size, so a variety of metal and phototype versions of Futura exist on which a revival could potentially be based. In addition, revivals will need to add characters not present in the original Futura like the Euro sign and Cyrillic, and therefore do not all have the same character set.\n\nFutura revivals may also decide to make design changes, like replacing Futura\u2019s straight 'j' with a more conventional substitute as URW's revival does. Scangraphic's revival notably includes [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]], with a tighter-spaced design (SH) created for headlines and a more spread-out version (SB) for body text sizes.<ref name=\"Futura SH\">{{cite web|title=Futura SH|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Scangraphic|access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Futura SB\">{{cite web|title=Futura SB|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sb/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Scangraphic|access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref> As an assessment of the decisions involved, a wide-ranging review by Stephen Coles of digitisations of Futura and its competitor geometrics noted that Bitstream's \"abandons some of the strict geometry in favour of a more harmonious whole, but it may not be the Futura you were expecting,\" and that URW's Futura Nr. 2 was \"Possibly optimized for small text: it\u2019s wider, ascenders shorter, counters larger, and apertures more open.

The metal lead type in the letterpress facility of the school were given by Renner to [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], the school founder, and the original 1927 forms are, as Sozoo described it, \"the first draft of Futura as we know it.\" While the capital letters are very similar to their modern counterparts (some visible differences include capital J's descent below the base line and a slightly higher crossbar on capital A), FuturaRenner uses text figures as opposed to the usual lining figures, and the letter forms of r (which has a distinctive dot-and-line styling), m and n (both of which are box-based and unrounded) are in particular contrast to modern Futura adaptations. FuturaRenner is available in light and regular weights, both of which are licensed under the [[SIL Open Font License]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/futura-renner|title=Futura Renner|first=Bastien|last=Sozoo|work=[[Open Font Library]]|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Influence on other typefaces==\nThough [[Erbar (typeface)|Erbar]] was the first of the new geometric sans-serif faces, the enormous success of Futura fostered the creation of many new geometric sans-serif faces by competing foundries including [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]], [[Metro (typeface)|Metro]], [[Spartan (typeface)|Spartan]] by Linotype, Vogue by [[Intertype Corporation|Intertype]], [[Twentieth Century (typeface)|Twentieth Century]] by Monotype and Airport by [[Baltimore Type Foundry|Baltotype]], [[Semplicit\u00e0]] by [[Nebiolo Printech|Nebiolo]], and Tempo by [[Ludlow Typograph|Ludlow]].

CNN International carries news-related programming worldwide; it cooperates with parent network [[CNN]]'s national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, [[CNN]], a US-only subscription service which is mostly broadcast from CNN studios in [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta]], CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and mostly broadcast from studios outside the US, in [[London]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Abu Dhabi]]. In some countries, it is available as a [[free-to-air]] network. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[BBC World News]], [[France 24]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]], [[NHK World-Japan|NHK World]] or [[Al Jazeera English]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[Image:CNN-International-Logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 1985 to 1995]]\nCNN International, in large part a result of [[Ted Turner]]'s globalization ideals, began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN's original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System's channels. Today, it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the [[CNN Center]], and the newsroom lacked even a [[digital clock]]. The vast majority of the network's programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels ([[CNN|CNN/US]] and [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]]). In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly. A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against [[BBC World Service Television]]'s news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: \"My idea was, we're just going to give people the facts... We didn't have to show liberty and democracy as good, and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... clearly everybody's going to choose liberty and democracy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/recipient_1997.html|title=CNN International - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center \u2013 constitutioncenter.org}}</ref>\n\n===New international era (1995\u20132006)===\n[[Image:CNN International.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005.]]\nIn 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI's diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler \"international\" aesthetic going forward. The word \"International\" in the channel's logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html|title=CNN International &#124; Idents|publisher=TVARK|accessdate=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054454/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html#|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132009 revamp===\n[[Image:CNN-globe-logo.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from January 1, 2006, to September 21, 2009.]]\nThe network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the \"lower-thirds\" that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts.\n\nIn the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the [[CNNfn]] financial channel, until that channel's demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including [[Time Warner Cable]], [[AT&T U-Verse]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Cox Communications]].\n\n===Going beyond borders (2009\u20132013)===\nThroughout January until September 2009, CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program Amanpour. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline \"Go Beyond Borders\", along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (''World News'', ''CNN Today'', ''World News Asia'', ''World News Europe'' and ''Your World Today'') into a single newscast entitled ''World Report''.\n\nThe slogan \"Go Beyond Borders\" emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth & Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs ''Amanpour'' and ''World One''. The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics.\n\nOn January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with [[Al Jazeera English]], the network launched a new production center: CNN [[Abu Dhabi]], based in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for [[Middle East]] viewers, ''Prism''.\n\nIn 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' which was later cancelled and replaced with [[CNN Tonight]] hosted by Don Lemon.\n[[Image:CNN International 2009.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 2009 to 2014.]]\n\n===This is CNN (2013\u2013present)===\n\"This is CNN\" represents CNN International's rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The \"This is CNN\" slogan is also used on its sister network [[CNN]] in USA. The managing director of CNN International from 2003 to May 2019 was Tony Maddox.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?] CNNi's president, Tony Maddox</ref>\n\nIn 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, with CNNI losing $10 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/28/cnn-preparing-cuts-london-based-news-operation|title=CNN preparing to make cuts at London-based news operation|first=Jim|last=Waterson|work=The Guardian|date=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Regional and online versions==\nThere are six variants of CNN International:\n* [[CNN International Asia Pacific]], based in [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR]],\n* [[CNN International Europe/Middle East/Africa]], based in London, [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[CNN International Latin America]], based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.\n* [[CNN International Middle East]], based in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]]\n* CNN International North America, based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.\n* [[CNN International South Asia]], based in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]\n\nThe schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as content during the show breaks (e.g. weather forecasts and local airtimes shown).\n\nCNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will. CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vause|first=John|title=San Francisco Torch Relay Broadcast|publisher=CNN|date=April 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, CNN International was made available online in the United States for [[TV Everywhere|CNN/U.S subscribers on participating television providers]] through the CNNgo service.<ref name=\"tvnewser-cnngo\">{{cite web|title=CNN International Now Available on CNNgo|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cnn-international-now-available-on-cnngo/266213|website=TVNewser|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Simulcasts between CNNI and CNN/US==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\nAlthough dramatically scaled down since its early days, CNNI currently draws from the feed of the main CNN channel for all editions of ''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper]]'', ''[[Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0]]'', ''[[Cuomo Prime Time]]'', both hours of ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer]]'' and ''[[CNN Tonight|CNN Tonight with Don Lemon]]'', the whole three hours of the weekday edition of ''[[New Day (TV series)|New Day]]'', several hours of the CNN/U.S. ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'', the Sunday edition of ''[[Inside Politics]]'', ''[[State of the Union (American TV program)|State of the Union]]'', ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'', ''[[Reliable Sources]]'', ''[[Smerconish]]'' and some ''[[CNN Special Investigations Unit]]'' documentaries.<ref name=CNNI>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/tv/schedule/europe|title=International Schedule - Europe|work=CNN|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The timepiece of CNN/US is replaced by that of CNNI, but no longer the ticker, and CNN/US's red logo on a white field is retained in the on-screen graphic (rather than replaced by CNNI's white logo on a red field), signifying CNN/US as the originating source.\n\nCNNI also simulcasts CNN/U.S. newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world. Examples include the [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|death and funeral of Ronald Reagan]], the crash of [[Colgan Air Flight 3407|Continental Airlines Flight 3407]] in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] suburb of [[Clarence Center, New York|Clarence Center]], the Hudson River plane landing, the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight 253 and the death and memorial service of [[Michael Jackson]] as well as scheduled broadcasts such as ''[[New Year's Eve Live]]'' and ''Election Night in America''.\n\nLikewise, CNN/U.S. occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S. A notable case was during the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death of Pope John Paul II]] and the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombings of July 7, 2005]]. CNN/U.S. simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of [[Pakistan]]'s former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] on the night after her assassination took place. Simulcasts also happened from November 27 to 29, 2008, due to the terror attacks in [[Mumbai, India]], on January 4, 2009, when Israel launched strikes into Gaza, and during the early hours of January 14, 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti.\n\nFrom 2005 until early 2008, CNNI's ''[[Your World Today]]'' aired on CNN/U.S.<ref>{{cite web|author=Home+ |url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/ |title=Breaking News, Latest News and Videos - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> during the 12\u20131 p.m. ET timeslot.

Furthermore, the next day, with storms impending, CNN/U.S. had to move onto CNNI's U.S. news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, CNN/U.S. dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ''[[In the Arena|ParkerSpitzer]]'' and ''Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0'' during the 4\u20136 a.m. ET time period, and began to simulcast ''World Business Today'' and ''World One'' from CNNI in those slots. Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in [[4:3]] fullscreen frames on CNN/U.S.' standard-definition and high-definition feeds (the SD feed of CNN/US switched to a [[widescreen]] [[letterbox]] screen format on January 11, 2011). ''World One'' was dropped from CNN/U.S. just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of ''American Morning'' which has been replaced with ''[[Early Start]]''.\n\nAs of August 2014, following [[Ferguson unrest|the unrest]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a permanent simulcast of CNNI's block of ''Newsroom'' with [[Rosemary Church]] and [[Errol Barnett]] was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/U.S., serving as a lead-in to ''Early Start''.

In February 2013, the European SD feed of CNN International began broadcasting in widescreen by downscaling the HD feed, which resulted in all 4:3-native programming being broadcast in [[pillarbox]] until the June 3 switchover, finalising on June 17 of the same year, when the switchover was completed.\n\nFollowing the March 2003 launch of [[CNNj]], a live relay of CNN/U.S. and CNN International, with simultaneous audio translation into Japanese,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/factsheets/partnersandjv/?catID=19|title=CNN Partners|publisher=cnnasiapacific.com|accessdate=16 April 2020|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729154345/http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/factsheets/partnersandjv/?catID=19#|archive-date=2012-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> starting in late 2010, the high definition feed of CNN/U.S. was launched in Japan under the name '''CNN HD'''.<ref>http://www.jctv.co.jp/images/press101108.pdf</ref> CNN/U.S. (both SD and HD) is also available on Greater China-based satellite service [[DishHD]], a subsidiary of [[Dish Network]] in the United States.\n\nOn June 28, 2016, CNN International HD was launched for Sky customers in the UK (including on Freesat from Sky), on channel 506 or 579, making the [[Arirang (TV network)|next news channel]] launch in the 600s, as it is next to the [[God TV|GOD Channel]].  The HD version is available free-to-air within the British Isles, and is provided on satellite and IPTV services, and also live-streamed for U.K. users (and geo-blocked outside the U.K.), through CNN International's official U.K. video site. However, viewers with non-proprietary Freesat boxes will need to add the channel manually as Freesat does not market CNN International HD publicly as part of its offerings.\n\n==Online==\nCNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.\n\nCNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.\n\nThe now-defunct topical news program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm|title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=USA Today|last=Johnson|first=Peter|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]''. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos|date=April 12, 2008|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|last=Cobb|first=Chris|accessdate=January 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621203445/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562#|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home.<ref name=\"CNNlivestreaming\">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/flashLive/live.html |title=CNN.com Live |website=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the [[RealNetworks]] SuperPass subscription outside the U.S. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]].

CNN International carries news-related programming worldwide; it cooperates with parent network [[CNN]]'s national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, [[CNN]], a US-only subscription service which is mostly broadcast from CNN studios in [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta]], CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and mostly broadcast from studios outside the US, in [[London]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Abu Dhabi]]. In some countries, it is available as a [[free-to-air]] network. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[BBC World News]], [[France 24]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]], [[NHK World-Japan|NHK World]] or [[Al Jazeera English]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[Image:CNN-International-Logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 1985 to 1995]]\nCNN International, in large part a result of [[Ted Turner]]'s globalization ideals, began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN's original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System's channels. Today, it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the [[CNN Center]], and the newsroom lacked even a [[digital clock]]. The vast majority of the network's programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels ([[CNN|CNN/US]] and [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]]). In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly. A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against [[BBC World Service Television]]'s news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: \"My idea was, we're just going to give people the facts... We didn't have to show liberty and democracy as good, and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... clearly everybody's going to choose liberty and democracy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/recipient_1997.html|title=CNN International - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center \u2013 constitutioncenter.org}}</ref>\n\n===New international era (1995\u20132006)===\n[[Image:CNN International.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005.]]\nIn 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI's diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler \"international\" aesthetic going forward. The word \"International\" in the channel's logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html|title=CNN International &#124; Idents|publisher=TVARK|accessdate=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054454/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html#|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132009 revamp===\n[[Image:CNN-globe-logo.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from January 1, 2006, to September 21, 2009.]]\nThe network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the \"lower-thirds\" that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts.\n\nIn the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the [[CNNfn]] financial channel, until that channel's demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including [[Time Warner Cable]], [[AT&T U-Verse]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Cox Communications]].\n\n===Going beyond borders (2009\u20132013)===\nThroughout January until September 2009, CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program Amanpour. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline \"Go Beyond Borders\", along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (''World News'', ''CNN Today'', ''World News Asia'', ''World News Europe'' and ''Your World Today'') into a single newscast entitled ''World Report''.\n\nThe slogan \"Go Beyond Borders\" emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth & Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs ''Amanpour'' and ''World One''. The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics.\n\nOn January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with [[Al Jazeera English]], the network launched a new production center: CNN [[Abu Dhabi]], based in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for [[Middle East]] viewers, ''Prism''.\n\nIn 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' which was later cancelled and replaced with [[CNN Tonight]] hosted by Don Lemon.\n[[Image:CNN International 2009.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 2009 to 2014.]]\n\n===This is CNN (2013\u2013present)===\n\"This is CNN\" represents CNN International's rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The \"This is CNN\" slogan is also used on its sister network [[CNN]] in USA. The managing director of CNN International from 2003 to May 2019 was Tony Maddox.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?] CNNi's president, Tony Maddox</ref>\n\nIn 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, with CNNI losing $10 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/28/cnn-preparing-cuts-london-based-news-operation|title=CNN preparing to make cuts at London-based news operation|first=Jim|last=Waterson|work=The Guardian|date=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Regional and online versions==\nThere are six variants of CNN International:\n* [[CNN International Asia Pacific]], based in [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR]],\n* [[CNN International Europe/Middle East/Africa]], based in London, [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[CNN International Latin America]], based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.\n* [[CNN International Middle East]], based in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]]\n* CNN International North America, based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.\n* [[CNN International South Asia]], based in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]\n\nThe schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as content during the show breaks (e.g. weather forecasts and local airtimes shown).\n\nCNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will.

Examples include the [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|death and funeral of Ronald Reagan]], the crash of [[Colgan Air Flight 3407|Continental Airlines Flight 3407]] in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] suburb of [[Clarence Center, New York|Clarence Center]], the Hudson River plane landing, the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight 253 and the death and memorial service of [[Michael Jackson]] as well as scheduled broadcasts such as ''[[New Year's Eve Live]]'' and ''Election Night in America''.\n\nLikewise, CNN/U.S. occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S. A notable case was during the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death of Pope John Paul II]] and the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombings of July 7, 2005]]. CNN/U.S. simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of [[Pakistan]]'s former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] on the night after her assassination took place. Simulcasts also happened from November 27 to 29, 2008, due to the terror attacks in [[Mumbai, India]], on January 4, 2009, when Israel launched strikes into Gaza, and during the early hours of January 14, 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti.\n\nFrom 2005 until early 2008, CNNI's ''[[Your World Today]]'' aired on CNN/U.S.<ref>{{cite web|author=Home+ |url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/ |title=Breaking News, Latest News and Videos - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> during the 12\u20131 p.m. ET timeslot.

Furthermore, the next day, with storms impending, CNN/U.S. had to move onto CNNI's U.S. news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, CNN/U.S. dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ''[[In the Arena|ParkerSpitzer]]'' and ''Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0'' during the 4\u20136 a.m. ET time period, and began to simulcast ''World Business Today'' and ''World One'' from CNNI in those slots. Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in [[4:3]] fullscreen frames on CNN/U.S.' standard-definition and high-definition feeds (the SD feed of CNN/US switched to a [[widescreen]] [[letterbox]] screen format on January 11, 2011). ''World One'' was dropped from CNN/U.S. just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of ''American Morning'' which has been replaced with ''[[Early Start]]''.\n\nAs of August 2014, following [[Ferguson unrest|the unrest]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a permanent simulcast of CNNI's block of ''Newsroom'' with [[Rosemary Church]] and [[Errol Barnett]] was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/U.S., serving as a lead-in to ''Early Start''.

The HD version is available free-to-air within the British Isles, and is provided on satellite and IPTV services, and also live-streamed for U.K. users (and geo-blocked outside the U.K.), through CNN International's official U.K. video site. However, viewers with non-proprietary Freesat boxes will need to add the channel manually as Freesat does not market CNN International HD publicly as part of its offerings.\n\n==Online==\nCNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.\n\nCNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.\n\nThe now-defunct topical news program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm|title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=USA Today|last=Johnson|first=Peter|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]''. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos|date=April 12, 2008|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|last=Cobb|first=Chris|accessdate=January 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621203445/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562#|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home.<ref name=\"CNNlivestreaming\">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/flashLive/live.html |title=CNN.com Live |website=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref> CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the [[RealNetworks]] SuperPass subscription outside the U.S. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]].

[[Junior Soprano|Uncle Junior]] tells him that he had a brother, Ercole, long dead, who was, in Junior's words, mentally \"slow\". He also tells him that [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Giovanni \"Johnny Boy\" Soprano|his father]] left a \"package\" of money to his mother.\n\nTony tells [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] that he is angry with everybody, but doesn't know why; he wants to hit her, and the happy-looking people he sees in the street. He despises the weaklings who run to psychiatrists and tells her, as he has told her before, that he admires the strong, silent type, like [[Gary Cooper]].\n\nAn old school friend of Tony's, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|David Scatino]], owns a sporting goods store in [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]]. His son, Eric, is a classmate of [[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]]'s, and they are going to sing a duet at their high school's cabaret night, although Meadow has requested a solo slot.\n\nDavey, as Tony calls him, is a compulsive gambler, owing [[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie Aprile]] $8,000, and Richie bars him from his small [[poker]] game until he has paid up. At their children's school, Davey meets Tony and asks him to let him play in the \"Executive Game\", a high-stakes game which Tony has taken over from the [[house arrest|house-arrested]] Junior. Tony refuses: \"These people play deep,\" he says. But when the game begins at the motel that Tony's crew have [[Denial, Anger, Acceptance|taken over]], Davey knocks at the door and again tries to persuade Tony to let him play. After some thought, he agrees. The game goes on through the night, and Tony falls asleep on the bed. \n\nWhen he wakes in the morning, Davey is down $45,000. Richie visits the motel; when he sees Davey playing he chokes him, breaking up the game. For this act of disrespect, Tony tells Richie that he is not permitted to collect his debt from Davey until Tony has collected his. [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] tells Richie he has a right to stand up to Tony.\n\nWhen no payment is received by the first deadline, Tony goes to Davey's office at the store and beats him. Davey finds pretext to take Eric's SUV away from him, and hands it over to Tony as partial payment. Tony presents it to Meadow, but when she realizes it was Eric's car she tearfully rejects it. At the cabaret night, Eric refuses at the last minute to duet with her and walks out, leaving Meadow to perform a solo as she had always hoped.\n\n==First appearances==\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Vito Spatafore|Vito Spatafore]]''': Richie Aprile's nephew, who is also in his crew.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|David Scatino]]''': Tony's childhood friend and compulsive gambler.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|Dr. Ira Fried]]''': A player in the Executive Game and doctor specialized in treating erectile dysfunction.

[[Junior Soprano|Uncle Junior]] tells him that he had a brother, Ercole, long dead, who was, in Junior's words, mentally \"slow\". He also tells him that [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Giovanni \"Johnny Boy\" Soprano|his father]] left a \"package\" of money to his mother.\n\nTony tells [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] that he is angry with everybody, but doesn't know why; he wants to hit her, and the happy-looking people he sees in the street. He despises the weaklings who run to psychiatrists and tells her, as he has told her before, that he admires the strong, silent type, like [[Gary Cooper]].\n\nAn old school friend of Tony's, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|David Scatino]], owns a sporting goods store in [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]]. His son, Eric, is a classmate of [[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]]'s, and they are going to sing a duet at their high school's cabaret night, although Meadow has requested a solo slot.\n\nDavey, as Tony calls him, is a compulsive gambler, owing [[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie Aprile]] $8,000, and Richie bars him from his small [[poker]] game until he has paid up. At their children's school, Davey meets Tony and asks him to let him play in the \"Executive Game\", a high-stakes game which Tony has taken over from the [[house arrest|house-arrested]] Junior. Tony refuses: \"These people play deep,\" he says. But when the game begins at the motel that Tony's crew have [[Denial, Anger, Acceptance|taken over]], Davey knocks at the door and again tries to persuade Tony to let him play. After some thought, he agrees. The game goes on through the night, and Tony falls asleep on the bed. \n\nWhen he wakes in the morning, Davey is down $45,000. Richie visits the motel; when he sees Davey playing he chokes him, breaking up the game. For this act of disrespect, Tony tells Richie that he is not permitted to collect his debt from Davey until Tony has collected his. [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] tells Richie he has a right to stand up to Tony.\n\nWhen no payment is received by the first deadline, Tony goes to Davey's office at the store and beats him. Davey finds pretext to take Eric's SUV away from him, and hands it over to Tony as partial payment. Tony presents it to Meadow, but when she realizes it was Eric's car she tearfully rejects it. At the cabaret night, Eric refuses at the last minute to duet with her and walks out, leaving Meadow to perform a solo as she had always hoped.\n\n==First appearances==\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Vito Spatafore|Vito Spatafore]]''': Richie Aprile's nephew, who is also in his crew.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|David Scatino]]''': Tony's childhood friend and compulsive gambler.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|Dr. Ira Fried]]''': A player in the Executive Game and doctor specialized in treating erectile dysfunction.

{"title_page": "List of recurring Entourage characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\nThis is the list of major and minor recurring characters in the [[HBO]] [[comedy-drama]] television series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. This list focuses on the characters themselves whether they are real people or [[fictional character]]s.  For the complete list of celebrity appearances and cameos see the [[List of celebrities appearing on Entourage]]. Characters with links indicate the actual actor/actress in the role.\n\n==Major recurring characters==\n\n===Lloyd Lee===\nA [[gay]] Mongolian-American with an [[art history]] degree from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[MBA]] from [[Stanford Business School]], Lloyd first appeared in the second season as Ari's assistant. Unlike with Ari's previous assistants, he is able to endure his boss' frequent barbs at his sexual orientation and ethnicity. When Ari is fired in the episode \"Exodus,\" Lloyd is the only one who joins him on the way out and works for Ari's new agency in the third season. Over the course of the season, he continues to prove himself on the job, booking Drama's role in the new NBC series ''Five Towns''. Ari eventually earns Lloyd's gratitude when he rescues Lloyd from a gay TV writer who wanted to take advantage of him and reunites him with his boyfriend after a breakup in the fourth season. Having spent years as Ari's assistant by the time of the sixth season, Lloyd tries to talk to him about a promotion. Ari makes him endure a series of challenges over 100 days, which proves so hard for Lloyd, that he leaves Ari to take up Adam Davies' offer to work at TMA. Ari responds in the episode \"Berried Alive\" by ensuring that nobody in Hollywood will work with Lloyd again, starting with his attempt to sign Drama as a client after he is taken off ''Five Towns''. When the Miller-Gold Agency merges with TMA in the season 6 finale \"Give A Little Bit,\" Ari finally promotes Lloyd as an agent. Lloyd continues to work under him into the seventh season. In the final season, Ari makes Lloyd the interim chief of TMA's TV division upon the condition that he will task the ''[[Mad Men]]'' production staff to derail the audition of a waiter Ari mistakes as dating his wife. As Ari steps down from TMA in the series finale, Lloyd is surprised and confronts Ari for not letting him know early on, telling Ari that he was his inspiration. Ari exhorts Lloyd to continue working at TMA under Babs Miller. In the movie, Ari agrees to give away Lloyd at his wedding. Played by [[Rex Lee (actor)|Rex Lee]] (74 Episodes)\n\n=== Melissa 'Mrs Ari' Gold===\nA former soap actress turned [[Beverly Hills]] socialite, Melissa Gold, known for most of the show's run as \"Mrs. Ari\", is Ari's long-suffering wife and the mother of his children. She is strong enough to stand up to Ari's intimidating personality, and is in charge of the homestead. It is revealed in season 3 that the two first met at [[Harvard College|Harvard]] years before the events of the series and that she came from a rich Jewish family who left her a sizable trust fund (which Ari dips into to finance his new agency). In season 4, she receives a call from the producers of the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to reprise her old role of Kendall Scott for a one-day comeback but turns down a full-time role to concentrate on raising her children. In season five, it is revealed that Melissa once featured in an erotic film that Ari tried to hide, but Adam Davies posted a picture from the film on the web. Mrs Ari has been shown to fully support her husband in his decisions through thick and thin, although in season 6, she is disgusted with Ari lying to her about Andrew Klein cheating on his wife Marlo (whom she had become close friends with). In the season 6 finale \"Give A Little Bit,\" Mrs Ari refuses to give Ari additional money to buy out the Terrance McQuewick Agency because of his admission of wanting to avenge his firing years before, but she is convinced to lend him the money for business reasons. The marital problems that built up in season 7 prompts Mrs Ari to separate from Ari and files for divorce while seeing [[Bobby Flay]] for most of the eighth season. However, Mrs Ari breaks up with Flay and reconciles with Ari in the series finale.\n\nMrs. Ari is a recurring guest star in the first three seasons and a credited star in the intro of Season 4. Creator/Producer/Head Writer [[Doug Ellin]] stated that the change in the introduction credits is the work of HBO. He added in many interviews and on various DVD commentaries that Mrs. Ari will never get a first name in the show. In the eighth season, however, it is finally revealed that her first name is Melissa. Ellin based Mrs Ari's name on his wife, Melissa Hecht. Reeves was brought into the cast while she was shooting [[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr and Mrs Smith]].<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/entourage-roundtable-214427#4</ref> Played by [[Perrey Reeves]] (68 Episodes)\n\n===Shauna Roberts===\nVince's publicist and his self-appointed \"West-Coast mother\", Shauna is a brutally honest woman who speaks her mind to Vince and the boys. She is a recurring guest star over the course of the show. While working in Vince's camp, she is seen to have raised two children. In the fifth season, Shauna steps in to help Vince's income stream by encouraging him to appear at a sweet sixteen party for USD200,000. In the final season, she assists Vince with the damage control in light of an article ''Vanity Fair'' reporter Sophia Lear wrote about him. Creator/Producer/Head Writer Doug Ellin has stated the change in the introduction credits is the work of HBO.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Played by [[Debi Mazar]]. (36 Episodes)\n\n===Sloan McQuewick===\nFirst appearing in the second season, Sloan is Terrance McQuewick's daughter, to whom E takes a liking. Although they hit it off well in seasons 2 and 3, Sloan is disappointed when E moves in with her by the end of the season 3 finale but does not fully unpack his belongings. They broke up in the period between seasons 3 and 4 when E returns from the ''Medellin'' shoot and suddenly goes with the gang to Italy. Sloan reappears in the fifth season as E seeks her help in convincing Seth Green - who taunts E about his supposed past with her - to accept a role in a new show. Despite helping E lease one of her friends' houses to him in the sixth season and also land him a new job with her godfather, Sloan admits that she cannot get back with him unless they can really determine what they want from each other. A long fight on the road in the season 6 finale results in Sloan accepting E's marriage proposal. The couple plan their wedding for most of the seventh season, but they break up again during the interim of Seasons 7 and 8 because of Terrance's [[prenup]] demand as well as the takeover at Murray Berenson. In the final season, it is revealed that Sloan and E did not part amicably and spend one romantic moment together before E discovers Sloan will move to New York. When she is found to be carrying Eric's baby, Turtle, Drama, and Vince ask her to give E - whom she still loves - another chance and gets on a plane with him to an undisclosed location when Vince goes to Paris to get married. Played by [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]. (28 Episodes)\n\n===Billy Walsh===\nMaking his debut in the Season 1 episode \"The Scene,\" Walsh is first hired by Vince to direct his upcoming movie, ''Queens Boulevard'', on account of his triumph at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] with his indie movie ''Daze''. He partially rewrites the script to include a scene in which Vince's character has a homosexual encounter. The boys worry over the scene, but Walsh persuades Vince of its viability as a test of his commitment to the project - by admitting that the scene will not be made at all. The team shoots the movie in New York during the interlude between Seasons 1 and 2.\n\nIn season 2, Walsh aims for a second Sundance trophy by successfully submitting ''Queens Boulevard'' for exhibition, but defiantly insists that [[James Cameron]] - whom Vince wants to meet to firmly land the title role in ''Aquaman'' - watch it at the festival instead of sending him a print. The movie is eventually well received. In the third season, the studio prepares to release ''QB'' for a wider audience, but Walsh seeks an injunction because the general-release version would be [[Film colorization|colorized]]; it is implied that he was denied the injunction. Late in the season, the gang brings back Walsh - who is working as a porn film director - to direct the shooting of ''Medellin'' after he reads the script, knowing his ability to make quality films with small budgets. He agrees on the condition that he will have [[Final cut privilege|final cut]]. He later decides it will be shot in Spanish. \n\nIn the fourth season, the gang goes down to Colombia to shoot ''Medellin''. However, Walsh falls apart on the set over the course of the shoot, with some of his antics include banning cellphones during production meetings, violently firing a director of photography for poorly shooting a scene, conducting witch hunts to see who may have seduced a local woman ([[Sofia Vergara]]) hired for the shoot, and tapping [[Stephen Gaghan]] to help him rewrite the ending when he already revised it. Billy finishes filming the final scene of the movie, a military assault scene that he is pleased with. Walsh's conflicts in Colombia with E, whom he derisively calls \"suit,\" continue in Los Angeles for most of the season. Per his final cut authority, he avoids Vince and E from showing them the first cut and also refuses to consider editing it further after they see it. The [[Cannes Film Festival]] committee also accepts ''Medellin'' for screening, but not before Walsh gets angry at E for supposedly leaking the copy of a trailer (it is revealed that an editor's girlfriend did). Walsh hires Ari as his agent after Ari signs him, Vince and E to do a new movie, ''Lost in the Clouds''. Knowing E's pledge to never work with Walsh again, Vince tries to get Walsh off the movie. Walsh fires Ari over a threat about being sued for breach of contract because he disposed the ''Lost in the Clouds'' script to make an entirely new script for a sci-fi film called ''Silo''. Upon learning that Anna Faris is being managed by E, Walsh tries to get her aboard for the film, but she does not understand the script. He joins the gang in flying to Cannes for the ''Medellin'' premiere in the season finale \"The Cannes Kids\" but as with Cameron in ''Queens Boulevard'', he refuses to let Yair Marx see the film. E's warnings about a failure to edit the film come back to haunt him as the audience jeers away at ''Medellin'' after the world premiere. It is implied that this failure has resulted in the cancellation of the ''Silo'' project and it effectively ends Walsh's movie career.\n\nBilly returns in the season 7 episode \"Hair\" looking to find work again to feed his family. He explains that he had spent the past two years reforming his ways - including being an ordained minister - and specifically approaches E for help. Over the rest of the season, Billy works with Drama to create a new animated series called ''Johnny's Bananas''. In the final season, Walsh is temporarily rankled that Drama and [[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s labor strike could cost him his job. He also steps in to fix Vince's miner movie script and to direct it as well. The final fate of the project is left unknown with the ending of the series.\n\nAccording to interviews on the season 2 DVD, the Billy character was inspired mainly by ''Entourage'' writer [[Rob Weiss]] as well as [[Vincent Gallo]]. Played by [[Rhys Coiro]] (23 Episodes)\n\n===Barbara \"Babs\" Miller ===\nFirst appearing as Mandy Moore's agent in the second season, Babs is depicted as Ari Gold's mentor years before the events of the series. In the first half of season 3, Babs alerts Ari about the growing opposition to his creation of a new agency and comes to his aid after Terrence McQuewick  denies him the money. Ari and Babs agrees to a 51/49 partnership in the new Miller-Gold Agency (MGA), where they must both agree on hiring or firing employees. They periodically get at odds with each other over various company issues during the next two seasons. In the fifth season, after she discovers Ari being offered the presidency of Warner Brothers, Babs tells Ari she will pay him ten cents per every dollar he invested in the agency. She also objects to Ari's plans to merge MGA with Andrew Klein's Klein-Cutler Talent Agency despite its profitability and clean finances. She eventually relents and agrees to the buyout as long as Ari will take care of Klein's wages.\n\nIn season 6, Barbara wants to fire Klein after she sees him walking around the agency in his robe and threatens to do so unless he can sign [[Aaron Sorkin]] by the end of the day. Although Klein does land the job, Barbara begins to think less of him. In the seventh season, Babs works with Ari in dealing with the NFL and fallout from the disclosure of Lizzie Grant's blackmail. In the series finale, Ari lets her take over TMA as he resigns to spend time with his family.<ref>'''Babs''': Jesus Christ Ari, this is a place of business. <br>'''Ari''': Not for me, not anymore.<br> '''Babs''': What does that mean? <br> '''Ari''': It means take it, take it all. Take the company. Take your shares, take mine. I don't give a fuck!!! Entourage S8E8, ''The End'', August 2011.</ref> Played by [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. (23 Episodes)\n\n===Dana Gordon===\nFirst appearing in Season 2 as the vice-president for production at Warner Brothers, Dana works with Ari to help Vincent Chase secure the role for ''Aquaman''. The working relationship comes to a short end by the conclusion of season 3's first half when Ari's admission to Bob Ryan about Dana's information on the final fate of his Ramones film script gets her fired. Dana is accepted as an executive in another studio in the fourth season, where she clashes with Billy Walsh and Ari regarding the treatment of a script Walsh rewrote into an entirely new movie. She also avoids buying ''Medellin'' for distribution after the film's failure at the Cannes Film Festival. In the fifth season, Dana lands the presidency of Warner Brothers with Ari's help. The success of the maneuver results in Dana securing Vince for the film ''Smoke Jumpers'', but issues with director Verner Vollstedt eventually lead to the project's cancellation despite Dana's attempts to get him in line. In Season 7, Dana is rebuffed by Ari over Vince's drug test ordered by ''Air-Walker'' director Randell Wallace, who later resigns and Peter Berg assumes the director's chair.\n\nOver the course of the series, various exchanges between Ari and Dana hint at a romantic and sexual relationship in the early 1990s. Ari also joked to Dana in the seventh season about she becoming the woman he would like to fool around with if he decides to cheat on Mrs. Ari. In the final season, it is revealed that the two were lovers until September 1992. At the time, Dana wanted to marry Ari, who broke up with her so he can marry who eventually became Mrs. Ari. The repercussions from Ari and Mrs. Ari's separation at the start of the eighth season prompts him to seek solace once again in Dana's arms. Both regretted walking away from each other years before and try to make their renewed relationship work, even as Mrs. Ari files for divorce. The attempts fail, especially after Dana encounters Ari's children at the TMA office.\n\nAri and Dana finally part ways in the penultimate episode \"Second to Last\" when Ari states that despite them being good together and making Dana happy once again, he still loved his wife. A heartbroken Dana, who wanted to have a child with Ari as she was close to 40 years old, encourages him to go back to Mrs Ari. Played by [[Constance Zimmer]]. (21 Episodes)\n\n===Scott Lavin===\nFirst appearing in the season 6 episode \"No More Drama,\" Lavin is a young albeit ruthless and extremely manipulative manager at Murray Berenson's management group. However, he clashes with E on his first day at the company over signing Bob Saget, as Scott had been trying to do for the past month. Being familiar with E as former neighbors (in season 2) and fed up with Scott's repeated calls, Saget himself brushes off Scott and prefers to talk to E about signing on. Scott later mocks Eric over a sexual encounter late in the season. In the seventh season, their rivalry escalates as Scott takes advantage of E's concerns with his wedding by luring Vince away from Eric with ''Air-Walker'', a potential superhero franchise film. Despite agreeing to work together, the partnership sours as Scott is further marked as the catalyst of Vince's erratic behavior, although the partnership seems to have mended over time. As E learns of Murray's reporting to Terrance McQuewick about his work performance, Scott finally recruits him to aid in a takeover of the company, which is implied to have the support of the rank-and-file. It is also implied that while Scott likes Murray to his face, he secretly resents and despises the man because he's often absent from work.\n\nIn the final season, Scott and E are busy handling operations at the new Murphy Lavin management agency. As a result, Scott tags along with the rest of the gang. When E decides to go and take care of Sloan in the finale, Scott gets mixed signals from him about actually resigning from Murphy Lavin; E promises to talk about the matter with him when he returns in the future. Played by [[Scott Caan]]. (19 episodes)\n\n===Adam Davies===\nFirst appearing late in Season 1, Davies worked at the Terrance McQuewick Agency (TMA) and represented Drama, purportedly as part of a \"family deal\".

Although Ari asks Marlo to forgive Andrew, she bans her husband from their Beverly Hills home and also freezes his funds.

With his help, E eventually signs Bob Saget (who wants to have sex with his girlfriend in Murray's office as a condition to him joining), causing E to incur the wrath of colleague Scott Lavin and E eventually wins Murray over with his honesty. However, late in Season 7, E discovers that Murray has been reporting to Terrance McQuewick about his allegedly poor managerial skills, prompting him to join Lavin's takeover of the company despite his original opposition.

Drama, who approached Sigler to co-star with him in ''Five Towns'', suspects Coakley's trying to sleep with her and confronts the executive about it. When Drama tries to lay his hand on Coakley, the official taunts him with sexual exploits of himself and Sigler and eventually has the writers make less scenes involving Drama's character.

Unlike with Ari's previous assistants, he is able to endure his boss' frequent barbs at his sexual orientation and ethnicity. When Ari is fired in the episode \"Exodus,\" Lloyd is the only one who joins him on the way out and works for Ari's new agency in the third season. Over the course of the season, he continues to prove himself on the job, booking Drama's role in the new NBC series ''Five Towns''. Ari eventually earns Lloyd's gratitude when he rescues Lloyd from a gay TV writer who wanted to take advantage of him and reunites him with his boyfriend after a breakup in the fourth season. Having spent years as Ari's assistant by the time of the sixth season, Lloyd tries to talk to him about a promotion. Ari makes him endure a series of challenges over 100 days, which proves so hard for Lloyd, that he leaves Ari to take up Adam Davies' offer to work at TMA. Ari responds in the episode \"Berried Alive\" by ensuring that nobody in Hollywood will work with Lloyd again, starting with his attempt to sign Drama as a client after he is taken off ''Five Towns''. When the Miller-Gold Agency merges with TMA in the season 6 finale \"Give A Little Bit,\" Ari finally promotes Lloyd as an agent. Lloyd continues to work under him into the seventh season. In the final season, Ari makes Lloyd the interim chief of TMA's TV division upon the condition that he will task the ''[[Mad Men]]'' production staff to derail the audition of a waiter Ari mistakes as dating his wife. As Ari steps down from TMA in the series finale, Lloyd is surprised and confronts Ari for not letting him know early on, telling Ari that he was his inspiration. Ari exhorts Lloyd to continue working at TMA under Babs Miller. In the movie, Ari agrees to give away Lloyd at his wedding. Played by [[Rex Lee (actor)|Rex Lee]] (74 Episodes)\n\n=== Melissa 'Mrs Ari' Gold===\nA former soap actress turned [[Beverly Hills]] socialite, Melissa Gold, known for most of the show's run as \"Mrs. Ari\", is Ari's long-suffering wife and the mother of his children. She is strong enough to stand up to Ari's intimidating personality, and is in charge of the homestead. It is revealed in season 3 that the two first met at [[Harvard College|Harvard]] years before the events of the series and that she came from a rich Jewish family who left her a sizable trust fund (which Ari dips into to finance his new agency). In season 4, she receives a call from the producers of the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to reprise her old role of Kendall Scott for a one-day comeback but turns down a full-time role to concentrate on raising her children. In season five, it is revealed that Melissa once featured in an erotic film that Ari tried to hide, but Adam Davies posted a picture from the film on the web. Mrs Ari has been shown to fully support her husband in his decisions through thick and thin, although in season 6, she is disgusted with Ari lying to her about Andrew Klein cheating on his wife Marlo (whom she had become close friends with). In the season 6 finale \"Give A Little Bit,\" Mrs Ari refuses to give Ari additional money to buy out the Terrance McQuewick Agency because of his admission of wanting to avenge his firing years before, but she is convinced to lend him the money for business reasons. The marital problems that built up in season 7 prompts Mrs Ari to separate from Ari and files for divorce while seeing [[Bobby Flay]] for most of the eighth season. However, Mrs Ari breaks up with Flay and reconciles with Ari in the series finale.\n\nMrs. Ari is a recurring guest star in the first three seasons and a credited star in the intro of Season 4. Creator/Producer/Head Writer [[Doug Ellin]] stated that the change in the introduction credits is the work of HBO. He added in many interviews and on various DVD commentaries that Mrs. Ari will never get a first name in the show. In the eighth season, however, it is finally revealed that her first name is Melissa. Ellin based Mrs Ari's name on his wife, Melissa Hecht. Reeves was brought into the cast while she was shooting [[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr and Mrs Smith]].<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/entourage-roundtable-214427#4</ref> Played by [[Perrey Reeves]] (68 Episodes)\n\n===Shauna Roberts===\nVince's publicist and his self-appointed \"West-Coast mother\", Shauna is a brutally honest woman who speaks her mind to Vince and the boys.

(36 Episodes)\n\n===Sloan McQuewick===\nFirst appearing in the second season, Sloan is Terrance McQuewick's daughter, to whom E takes a liking. Although they hit it off well in seasons 2 and 3, Sloan is disappointed when E moves in with her by the end of the season 3 finale but does not fully unpack his belongings. They broke up in the period between seasons 3 and 4 when E returns from the ''Medellin'' shoot and suddenly goes with the gang to Italy. Sloan reappears in the fifth season as E seeks her help in convincing Seth Green - who taunts E about his supposed past with her - to accept a role in a new show. Despite helping E lease one of her friends' houses to him in the sixth season and also land him a new job with her godfather, Sloan admits that she cannot get back with him unless they can really determine what they want from each other. A long fight on the road in the season 6 finale results in Sloan accepting E's marriage proposal. The couple plan their wedding for most of the seventh season, but they break up again during the interim of Seasons 7 and 8 because of Terrance's [[prenup]] demand as well as the takeover at Murray Berenson. In the final season, it is revealed that Sloan and E did not part amicably and spend one romantic moment together before E discovers Sloan will move to New York.

Played by [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]. (28 Episodes)\n\n===Billy Walsh===\nMaking his debut in the Season 1 episode \"The Scene,\" Walsh is first hired by Vince to direct his upcoming movie, ''Queens Boulevard'', on account of his triumph at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] with his indie movie ''Daze''. He partially rewrites the script to include a scene in which Vince's character has a homosexual encounter. The boys worry over the scene, but Walsh persuades Vince of its viability as a test of his commitment to the project - by admitting that the scene will not be made at all. The team shoots the movie in New York during the interlude between Seasons 1 and 2.\n\nIn season 2, Walsh aims for a second Sundance trophy by successfully submitting ''Queens Boulevard'' for exhibition, but defiantly insists that [[James Cameron]] - whom Vince wants to meet to firmly land the title role in ''Aquaman'' - watch it at the festival instead of sending him a print. The movie is eventually well received. In the third season, the studio prepares to release ''QB'' for a wider audience, but Walsh seeks an injunction because the general-release version would be [[Film colorization|colorized]]; it is implied that he was denied the injunction. Late in the season, the gang brings back Walsh - who is working as a porn film director - to direct the shooting of ''Medellin'' after he reads the script, knowing his ability to make quality films with small budgets. He agrees on the condition that he will have [[Final cut privilege|final cut]]. He later decides it will be shot in Spanish. \n\nIn the fourth season, the gang goes down to Colombia to shoot ''Medellin''. However, Walsh falls apart on the set over the course of the shoot, with some of his antics include banning cellphones during production meetings, violently firing a director of photography for poorly shooting a scene, conducting witch hunts to see who may have seduced a local woman ([[Sofia Vergara]]) hired for the shoot, and tapping [[Stephen Gaghan]] to help him rewrite the ending when he already revised it. Billy finishes filming the final scene of the movie, a military assault scene that he is pleased with. Walsh's conflicts in Colombia with E, whom he derisively calls \"suit,\" continue in Los Angeles for most of the season. Per his final cut authority, he avoids Vince and E from showing them the first cut and also refuses to consider editing it further after they see it. The [[Cannes Film Festival]] committee also accepts ''Medellin'' for screening, but not before Walsh gets angry at E for supposedly leaking the copy of a trailer (it is revealed that an editor's girlfriend did). Walsh hires Ari as his agent after Ari signs him, Vince and E to do a new movie, ''Lost in the Clouds''. Knowing E's pledge to never work with Walsh again, Vince tries to get Walsh off the movie. Walsh fires Ari over a threat about being sued for breach of contract because he disposed the ''Lost in the Clouds'' script to make an entirely new script for a sci-fi film called ''Silo''. Upon learning that Anna Faris is being managed by E, Walsh tries to get her aboard for the film, but she does not understand the script. He joins the gang in flying to Cannes for the ''Medellin'' premiere in the season finale \"The Cannes Kids\" but as with Cameron in ''Queens Boulevard'', he refuses to let Yair Marx see the film. E's warnings about a failure to edit the film come back to haunt him as the audience jeers away at ''Medellin'' after the world premiere. It is implied that this failure has resulted in the cancellation of the ''Silo'' project and it effectively ends Walsh's movie career.\n\nBilly returns in the season 7 episode \"Hair\" looking to find work again to feed his family. He explains that he had spent the past two years reforming his ways - including being an ordained minister - and specifically approaches E for help. Over the rest of the season, Billy works with Drama to create a new animated series called ''Johnny's Bananas''. In the final season, Walsh is temporarily rankled that Drama and [[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s labor strike could cost him his job. He also steps in to fix Vince's miner movie script and to direct it as well. The final fate of the project is left unknown with the ending of the series.\n\nAccording to interviews on the season 2 DVD, the Billy character was inspired mainly by ''Entourage'' writer [[Rob Weiss]] as well as [[Vincent Gallo]]. Played by [[Rhys Coiro]] (23 Episodes)\n\n===Barbara \"Babs\" Miller ===\nFirst appearing as Mandy Moore's agent in the second season, Babs is depicted as Ari Gold's mentor years before the events of the series. In the first half of season 3, Babs alerts Ari about the growing opposition to his creation of a new agency and comes to his aid after Terrence McQuewick  denies him the money. Ari and Babs agrees to a 51/49 partnership in the new Miller-Gold Agency (MGA), where they must both agree on hiring or firing employees. They periodically get at odds with each other over various company issues during the next two seasons. In the fifth season, after she discovers Ari being offered the presidency of Warner Brothers, Babs tells Ari she will pay him ten cents per every dollar he invested in the agency. She also objects to Ari's plans to merge MGA with Andrew Klein's Klein-Cutler Talent Agency despite its profitability and clean finances. She eventually relents and agrees to the buyout as long as Ari will take care of Klein's wages.\n\nIn season 6, Barbara wants to fire Klein after she sees him walking around the agency in his robe and threatens to do so unless he can sign [[Aaron Sorkin]] by the end of the day. Although Klein does land the job, Barbara begins to think less of him. In the seventh season, Babs works with Ari in dealing with the NFL and fallout from the disclosure of Lizzie Grant's blackmail. In the series finale, Ari lets her take over TMA as he resigns to spend time with his family.<ref>'''Babs''': Jesus Christ Ari, this is a place of business. <br>'''Ari''': Not for me, not anymore.<br> '''Babs''': What does that mean? <br> '''Ari''': It means take it, take it all.

(23 Episodes)\n\n===Dana Gordon===\nFirst appearing in Season 2 as the vice-president for production at Warner Brothers, Dana works with Ari to help Vincent Chase secure the role for ''Aquaman''. The working relationship comes to a short end by the conclusion of season 3's first half when Ari's admission to Bob Ryan about Dana's information on the final fate of his Ramones film script gets her fired. Dana is accepted as an executive in another studio in the fourth season, where she clashes with Billy Walsh and Ari regarding the treatment of a script Walsh rewrote into an entirely new movie. She also avoids buying ''Medellin'' for distribution after the film's failure at the Cannes Film Festival. In the fifth season, Dana lands the presidency of Warner Brothers with Ari's help. The success of the maneuver results in Dana securing Vince for the film ''Smoke Jumpers'', but issues with director Verner Vollstedt eventually lead to the project's cancellation despite Dana's attempts to get him in line. In Season 7, Dana is rebuffed by Ari over Vince's drug test ordered by ''Air-Walker'' director Randell Wallace, who later resigns and Peter Berg assumes the director's chair.\n\nOver the course of the series, various exchanges between Ari and Dana hint at a romantic and sexual relationship in the early 1990s. Ari also joked to Dana in the seventh season about she becoming the woman he would like to fool around with if he decides to cheat on Mrs. Ari. In the final season, it is revealed that the two were once lovers until September 1992. At the time, Dana wanted to get married to Ari, who broke up with her so he can marry who eventually became Mrs. Ari. The repercussions from Ari and Mrs. Ari's separation at the start of the eighth season prompts him to seek solace once again in Dana's arms. Both regretted walking away from each other years before and try to make their renewed relationship work, even as Mrs. Ari files for divorce. The attempts fail, especially after Dana encounters Ari's children at the TMA office.\n\nAri and Dana finally part ways in the penultimate episode \"Second to Last\" when Ari states that despite them being good together and making Dana happy once again, he still loved his wife. A heartbroken Dana, who wanted to have a child with Ari as she was close to 40 years old, encourages him to go back to Mrs Ari. Played by [[Constance Zimmer]]. (21 Episodes)\n\n===Scott Lavin===\nFirst appearing in the season 6 episode \"No More Drama,\" Lavin is a young albeit ruthless and extremely manipulative manager at Murray Berenson's management group. However, he clashes with E on his first day at the company over signing Bob Saget, as Scott had been trying to do for the past month. Being familiar with E as former neighbors (in season 2) and fed up with Scott's repeated calls, Saget himself brushes off Scott and prefers to talk to E about signing on. Scott later mocks Eric over a sexual encounter late in the season. In the seventh season, their rivalry escalates as Scott takes advantage of E's concerns with his wedding by luring Vince away from Eric with ''Air-Walker'', a potential superhero franchise film. Despite agreeing to work together, the partnership sours as Scott is further marked as the catalyst of Vince's erratic behavior, although the partnership seems to have mended over time. As E learns of Murray's reporting to Terrance McQuewick about his work performance, Scott finally recruits him to aid in a takeover of the company, which is implied to have the support of the rank-and-file. It is also implied that while Scott likes Murray to his face, he secretly resents and despises the man because he's often absent from work.\n\nIn the final season, Scott and E are busy handling operations at the new Murphy Lavin management agency. As a result, Scott tags along with the rest of the gang. When E decides to go and take care of Sloan in the finale, Scott gets mixed signals from him about actually resigning from Murphy Lavin; E promises to talk about the matter with him when he returns in the future. Played by [[Scott Caan]].

When Ari plans a rebellion codenamed \"Tsetse Fly Elite Eight\" in the season 2 episode \"Exodus,\" he helps seal Ari's fate after he tips off returning TMA boss Terrance McQuewick to the plan, having been turned off by Ari's abrasive behavior. With Vince deciding to join Ari, Davies drops Drama as well. His deception continues in season 3 when Ari sets up a bigger agency to rival TMA and wants in on it, but Ari rejects Davies, prompting him to squeal to Terrance about Ari's plan. Davies reappears in Season 5, tricking Ari and Vince for false hopes of a meeting for a new project. Their rivalry takes a personal turn in the episode \"The All Out Fall Out\" when a simple drag race gradually escalates to Davies blackmailing Ari with pictures of Mrs Ari in an old soft-core porn movie, forcing Ari to threaten to beat him up in front of his colleagues at TMA. Davies eventually apologizes. In Season 6, Davies is promoted to being a partner at TMA. When Ari maneuvers to have [[Zac Efron]] fire him as his agent, Davies successfully offers Lloyd a job as agent at TMA. He is left uneasy with Ari and Terrance's negotiations of a merger. It is proven true in the season finale \"Give a Little Bit,\" as he is hit by Ari's paintball barrage in firing employees. Played by [[Jordan Belfi]].

She gives him a hand-job (and her phone number) during the flight, but gets angry after Turtle admits to the gang that it happened and Drama (who calls her by her character name in ''[[The Sopranos]]'') spread the word to skeptical friends. In the episode \"Play'n with Fire,\" Jamie suddenly calls up Turtle and offers to spend the weekend off with him. The date enables Jamie to get to know Turtle more and their friendship develops into a relationship by the end of the season.\n\nIn the sixth season, Jamie and Turtle finally make their relationship public as she accompanies him to the premiere of Vince's new movie, ''Gatsby''. The actress is also generous towards Turtle, giving him a new Porsche for his 30th birthday and helps him decide the next step in opening his limo service is to take a business administration course at [[UCLA|UCLA Extension]]. Jamie agrees to be Drama's love interest in ''Five Towns'' and attracts the interest of studio executive Dan Coakley, who wanted to talk with her about new projects. When Drama's hardships come over misconceptions about Coakley's supposed ulterior motives on Jamie, she tells Drama that she and Coakley strictly talked about business matters. At the same time, Jamie's relationship with Turtle is also a hot topic on campus, but she herself is jealous of one of Turtle's female classmates making a move on him and adding him on Facebook.

It is revealed in Klein's backstory that he and Ari once worked together at the Terrance McQuewick Agency until Terrance's partner, Jim Oliver, broke away to create his own agency, taking Klein and many other agents as well. Klein admits that the split was not beneficial because Oliver reportedly ripped off clients and employees alike. With the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]] sapping Klein-Cutler's earnings despite having clients everywhere in Hollywood, Klein seeks a $500,000 loan from Ari and shows his company records to prove he can pay it back in three months.

The Atpur Inscription of 977 AD lists 20 kings starting with Guhadatta and ending with Saktikumara.  Major cities included [[Nagda, Rajasthan|Nagahrada]] and Aghata.  [[Chittor]] was captured by [[Bappa Rawal]] in the 8th century. The Guhilas fought the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]]s in the 11th century and the [[Chaulukya]]s in the 12th century.  During the reign of Jaitrasimha (1213-1252 AD), Nagahrada was sacked by [[Iltutmish]].  Then Samarasimha (1273-1301 AD) submitted to Ulugh Khan before Ratnasimha was defeated by [[Alauddin Khalji]] in 1303 when [[Chittor Fort]] was captured.<ref name=\"sen\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>According to 1274 CE Chittor inscription and 1285 CE [[Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple|Achaleshwar]] ([[Mount Abu|Abu]]) inscription of Vedasharma, Bappa Rawal \"changed his priestly splendour for regal lustre\".
