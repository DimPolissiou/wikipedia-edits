{"title_page": "Trade during the Viking Age", "text_new": "{{citation style|date=February 2020}}\nWhile the [[Vikings]] are perhaps best known for accumulating wealth through [[plunder]], [[tribute]], and [[Conquest (military)|conquest]], they were also skilled and successful traders. The Vikings developed several trading centres both in Scandinavia and abroad as well as a series of long-distance trading routes during the [[Viking Age]] (c. 8th Century AD to 11th Century AD). Viking trading centres and trade routes would bring tremendous wealth and plenty of exotic goods such as Arab coins, Chinese Silks, and Indian Gems.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 10.</ref> Vikings also established a \"bullion economy\" in which weighed silver, and to a lesser extent gold, was used as a means of exchange. Evidence for the centrality of trade and economy can be found in the criminal archaeological record through evidence of theft, counterfeit coins, and smuggling.<ref>Kalmring, Sven. \u201cOf Thieves, Counterfeiters and Homicides\u202f: Crime in Hedeby and Birka,\u201d 2010.</ref> The Viking economy and trade network also effectively helped rebuild the European economy after the fall of the Roman Empire.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 123</ref><br />\n\n== Trade routes ==  \n\nThe Vikings had a vast, expansive, and planned out [[trade network]]. Trade took place on a gold level and over short and long distances. Improvements in ship technology and cargo capabilities made trade and the transport of goods much easier,<ref>Wolf, Kristen. ''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 97</ref> Especially as Europe began to shift to a bulk economy.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 128.</ref> The majority of trade was conducted among the several ports that lined the [[Scandinavian coast]]s,<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref> and the routes were well enough established that they were frequented by pirates looking to seize possessions.<ref>Wolf, Kristen. ''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004, 27</ref> Viking raids likely followed such established trade routes.<ref>Wolf, Kristen. ''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004, 124.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings also engaged in trade with merchants throughout Europe, Asia and the Far East.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref> The [[Volga trade route|Volga]] and [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|Dnieper]] Trade Routes were the two main trade routes that connected Northern Europe with [[Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Baghdad]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], and the end of the [[Silk Road]]. These trade routes were not only brought luxury and exotic goods from the Far East but also an overwhelming amount of silver Arab coins that were melted down for silver and also used for trade.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2004, 103.</ref>\n\nSeveral trade routes connected [[Scandinavia]] with the [[Mediterranean]] with trade routes that ran through Central Europe and around the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christys, Ann. ''Vikings In the South: Voyages to Iberia and the Mediterranean''. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015.</ref> In Iberia the first trade and exploration was likely in minerals due to the role that the region played in the Roman Period. The Iberian example shows how Viking were often traders and raiders, who in the aftermath of raids would use their newfound established power to establish trade.<ref>Christys, Ann. ''Vikings In the South: Voyages to Iberia and the Mediterranean''. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015, 4-5.</ref> The Vikings are also sent merchants as far west as [[Greenland]] and [[North America]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nTrade routes would play an important role in rebuilding the economy of Europe during the Viking Age. The collapse of the Roman Empire significantly reduced the European economy. Prior to the start of the Viking Age trade had begun to rise again but was highly dependent on [[Barter|bartering]], meaning that all trade hinged on \u201ca double coincidence of wants\u201d. Viking trade and raids helped reintroduce coins and other valuable goods that were either traded for or stolen back into the economy. Such goods were reintroduced into the economy through either trade or markets that were set up by the Vikings for the purpose of selling plundered objects.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 123.</ref>\n\n== Trading towns ==\n\nAt the beginning of the Viking Age, the first proper trading towns developed in Scandinavia. These appeared in central locations along Scandinavia's coasts near natural harbors or fjords. Trading centers varied in size, character, and significance. Only a select few developed into international trading posts. Every town was ruled by a king who imposed taxes on imported and exported goods in exchange for military protection of the town's citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>\n\nThe largest trading centers during the Viking Age were [[Ribe]] (Denmark), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Hedeby]] (Denmark), and [[Birka]] (Sweden) in the Baltic region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nHedeby was the largest and most important trading center.  Located along the southern border of Denmark in the inner part of the [[Schlei]] Fjord, Hedeby controlled both the north\u2013south trade routes (between Europe and Scandinavia) and the east\u2013west routes (between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]]s).<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref> At its peak, Hedeby's population was around 1000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>Archaeological evidence from Hedeby suggests that the city's economic importance was of political significance as fortifications were erected in the tenth century to withstand numerous assaults.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 107.</ref>\n\nRibe, located on the West coast of Denmark, was established in the early 8th century as the eastern end of a trading and monetary network that stretched around the North Sea.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref> Many of the trading towns in the Baltic would begin to disappear shortly after the year 1000 as the continent shifted to a bulk economy that minimized the role of these centres. This was also parallel with the rise of royal power in the region.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 128-29.</ref>\n\nThere were also several Viking trading centers located along several rivers in modern-day Russia including Gorodische, Gnezdovo, Cherigov, Novgorod, and Kiev. These towns became major trade destinations on the trading route from the Baltic Sea to Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Trade and Settlement ==\n\nViking settlements also played an important role in Viking trade. In Viking settlements such as [[History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Ireland]] the first peaceful interactions between the Native Irish and the Vikings were economic in nature.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Settlements in Ireland before 1014.\u201d ''Celtic-Norse Relationships in the Irish Sea in the Middle Ages'' 800, no. 1200 (2014): 2.</ref> Silver hordes in Ireland containing coins from other corners of the Viking World also show how such settlements were very quickly incorporated into a new Global economy.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Age Waterford.\u201d Accessed December 2, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.academia.edu/1499801/Viking_Age_Waterford</nowiki>, 91.</ref> Here the initial strategic military significance of such settlements morphed into economic and political significance.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Age Waterford.\u201d Accessed December 2, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.academia.edu/1499801/Viking_Age_Waterford</nowiki>, 94.</ref> Place names also show the broader economic significance and impact of the Vikings. The Copeland Islands off the coast of Ireland bear the name of \u201cMerchant Islands\u201d in Old Norse.

Domestic animals were also traded among local peoples. These items were brought into town by farmers and traded for basic necessities, such as tools and clothes, and luxury items, such as glassware and jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking female bloody Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref>\n\n== Bullion economy ==\n\n \n\n[[File:Viking weight combined only reflection.jpg|thumb|Anglo-Saxon-Viking Coin weight. Used for trading bullion and hack-silver. Material is lead and weighs approx 36&nbsp;g. Embedded with an Anglo-Saxon sceat (Series K type 32a) dating to 720-750 AD and minted in Kent. It is edged in dotted triangle pattern. Origin is the Danelaw region and dates 870-930CE]]\n\nThe Viking Age saw the development of a bullion economy. In this economic framework, traders and merchants exchanged goods for [[bullion]] (precious metals, primarily [[gold]] and [[silver]]). Trade was usually accomplished by barter. Bullion lacked the formal quality control linked with coinage and therefore provided a highly flexible system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|title=Viking Money|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|website=BBC}}</ref> The durability of silver and gold made them more suited for a monetary role than many other commodities. \n\nBy the 9th century, silver had become the basis for the Viking economy. Most of the silver was acquired from the Islamic world. When the silver mines near Baghdad ran dry in the late 10th century, the Vikings began to tap central Europe, specifically the [[Harz Mountains]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=Silver Economy in the Viking Age|last1=Graham-Campbell|first1=James|date=2007|publisher=Left Coast|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}</ref> Bullion took the form of coins, ingots, and jewelry. The value of bullion was determined by its purity and mass. Methods used to test the purity of the metal included \u201cpricking\" and \u201cpecking\u201d the surface to test the hardness of the alloy and reveal plating. Determining bullion's mass required the use of weights and scales. Many of the bronze scales used by Viking traders folded on themselves making them compact and easy to carry for travel.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe two types of weights imported from foreign lands were '''''cubo-octahedral weights''''' (''Dice weights'') and '''''oblate spheroids''''' (''barrel weights''). Both were produced in various sizes with markings indicating the weights they represented. The majority of imported weights came from the Islamic world and contained Arabic inscriptions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nVikings also produced their own weights for measuring quantities of silver and gold. These lead weights were decorated with enameling, insert coins, or cut up ornamental metalwork.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viking Weight|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=32976b0a-e67c-4f06-9921-782f3ba135d1|website=The National Museum of Ireland}}</ref> Unlike the dice weights or barrel weights, each lead weight was unique so there was no danger of them being rearranged or switched during the course of an exchange.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Exchange rates==\nEstimated exchange rates at the beginning of the 11th century in Iceland were:\n*8 ounces of silver = 1 ounce of gold\n*8 ounces of silver = 4 milk cows\n*8 ounces of silver = 24 sheep\n*8 ounces of silver = 144 ells (roughly 72 meters) of [[wadmal]] 2 ells wide (about 1 meter)\n*12 ounces of silver = 1 adult male slave<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>\n\nIf the weight of a piece of jewelry was more than needed to complete a purchase, it was cut up into smaller bits until the correct weight needed for the transaction was reached. The term [[hack silver]] is used to describe these silver objects.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}</ref> Silver ingots were primarily used for large/high-value transactions. The largest found weights weigh more than 1 kilogram each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\nPrecious metals were also used to display personal wealth and status. For example, [[Rus trader]]s symbolized their wealth through silver [[neck ring]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gareth|first1=Williams|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref> Silver or gold gifts were often exchanged to secure social and political relationships.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Graham-Campbell, James, and Gareth Williams.

The Vikings developed several trading centres both in Scandinavia and abroad as well as a series of long-distance trading routes during the [[Viking Age]] (c. 8th Century AD to 11th Century AD). Viking trading centres and trade routes would bring tremendous wealth and plenty of exotic goods such as Arab coins, Chinese Silks, and Indian Gems.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 10.</ref> Vikings also established a \"bullion economy\" in which weighed silver, and to a lesser extent gold, was used as a means of exchange.

Trade took place on a gold level and over short and long distances. Improvements in ship technology and cargo capabilities made trade and the transport of goods much easier,<ref>Wolf, Kristen. ''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''.

''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004, 27</ref> Viking raids likely followed such established trade routes.<ref>Wolf, Kristen. ''Daily Life of the Vikings''. Greenwood Press, 2004, 124.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings also engaged in trade with merchants throughout Europe, Asia and the Far East.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref> The [[Volga trade route|Volga]] and [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|Dnieper]] Trade Routes were the two main trade routes that connected Northern Europe with [[Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Baghdad]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], and the end of the [[Silk Road]]. These trade routes were not only brought luxury and exotic goods from the Far East but also an overwhelming amount of silver Arab coins that were melted down for silver and also used for trade.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2004, 103.</ref>\n\nSeveral trade routes connected [[Scandinavia]] with the [[Mediterranean]] with trade routes that ran through Central Europe and around the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christys, Ann. ''Vikings In the South: Voyages to Iberia and the Mediterranean''. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015.</ref> In Iberia the first trade and exploration was likely in minerals due to the role that the region played in the Roman Period. The Iberian example shows how Viking were often traders and raiders, who in the aftermath of raids would use their newfound established power to establish trade.<ref>Christys, Ann. ''Vikings In the South: Voyages to Iberia and the Mediterranean''. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015, 4-5.</ref> The Vikings are also sent merchants as far west as [[Greenland]] and [[North America]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nTrade routes would play an important role in rebuilding the economy of Europe during the Viking Age. The collapse of the Roman Empire significantly reduced the European economy. Prior to the start of the Viking Age trade had begun to rise again but was highly dependent on [[Barter|bartering]], meaning that all trade hinged on \u201ca double coincidence of wants\u201d. Viking trade and raids helped reintroduce coins and other valuable goods that were either traded for or stolen back into the economy. Such goods were reintroduced into the economy through either trade or markets that were set up by the Vikings for the purpose of selling plundered objects.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 123.</ref>\n\n== Trading towns ==\n\nAt the beginning of the Viking Age, the first proper trading towns developed in Scandinavia. These appeared in central locations along Scandinavia's coasts near natural harbors or fjords. Trading centers varied in size, character, and significance. Only a select few developed into international trading posts. Every town was ruled by a king who imposed taxes on imported and exported goods in exchange for military protection of the town's citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>\n\nThe largest trading centers during the Viking Age were [[Ribe]] (Denmark), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Hedeby]] (Denmark), and [[Birka]] (Sweden) in the Baltic region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nHedeby was the largest and most important trading center.  Located along the southern border of Denmark in the inner part of the [[Schlei]] Fjord, Hedeby controlled both the north\u2013south trade routes (between Europe and Scandinavia) and the east\u2013west routes (between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]]s).<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref> At its peak, Hedeby's population was around 1000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>Archaeological evidence from Hedeby suggests that the city's economic importance was of political significance as fortifications were erected in the tenth century to withstand numerous assaults.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 107.</ref>\n\nRibe, located on the West coast of Denmark, was established in the early 8th century as the eastern end of a trading and monetary network that stretched around the North Sea.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref> Many of the trading towns in the Baltic would begin to disappear shortly after the year 1000 as the continent shifted to a bulk economy that minimized the role of these centres. This was also parallel with the rise of royal power in the region.<ref>Winroth, Anders. ''The Age Of The Vikings''. Princeton University Press, 2014, 128-29.</ref>\n\nThere were also several Viking trading centers located along several rivers in modern-day Russia including Gorodische, Gnezdovo, Cherigov, Novgorod, and Kiev. These towns became major trade destinations on the trading route from the Baltic Sea to Central Asia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Trade and Settlement ==\n\nViking settlements also played an important role in Viking trade. In Viking settlements such as [[History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Ireland]] the first peaceful interactions between the Native Irish and the Vikings were economic in nature.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Settlements in Ireland before 1014.\u201d ''Celtic-Norse Relationships in the Irish Sea in the Middle Ages'' 800, no. 1200 (2014): 2.</ref> Silver hordes in Ireland containing coins from other corners of the Viking World also show how such settlements were very quickly incorporated into a new Global economy.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Age Waterford.\u201d Accessed December 2, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.academia.edu/1499801/Viking_Age_Waterford</nowiki>, 91.</ref> Here the initial strategic military significance of such settlements morphed into economic and political significance.<ref>Downham, Clare. \u201cViking Age Waterford.\u201d Accessed December 2, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.academia.edu/1499801/Viking_Age_Waterford</nowiki>, 94.</ref> Place names also show the broader economic significance and impact of the Vikings. The Copeland Islands off the coast of Ireland bear the name of \u201cMerchant Islands\u201d in Old Norse.

Domestic animals were also traded among local peoples. These items were brought into town by farmers and traded for basic necessities, such as tools and clothes, and luxury items, such as glassware and jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade in the Viking female bloody Period|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/trade-in-the-viking-period/|website=The National Museum of Denmark}}</ref>\n\n== Bullion economy ==\n\n \n\n[[File:Viking weight combined only reflection.jpg|thumb|Anglo-Saxon-Viking Coin weight. Used for trading bullion and hack-silver. Material is lead and weighs approx 36&nbsp;g. Embedded with an Anglo-Saxon sceat (Series K type 32a) dating to 720-750 AD and minted in Kent. It is edged in dotted triangle pattern. Origin is the Danelaw region and dates 870-930CE]]\n\nThe Viking Age saw the development of a bullion economy. In this economic framework, traders and merchants exchanged goods for [[bullion]] (precious metals, primarily [[gold]] and [[silver]]). Trade was usually accomplished by barter. Bullion lacked the formal quality control linked with coinage and therefore provided a highly flexible system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|title=Viking Money|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|website=BBC}}</ref> The durability of silver and gold made them more suited for a monetary role than many other commodities. \n\nBy the 9th century, silver had become the basis for the Viking economy. Most of the silver was acquired from the Islamic world. When the silver mines near Baghdad ran dry in the late 10th century, the Vikings began to tap central Europe, specifically the [[Harz Mountains]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=Silver Economy in the Viking Age|last1=Graham-Campbell|first1=James|date=2007|publisher=Left Coast|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}</ref> Bullion took the form of coins, ingots, and jewelry. The value of bullion was determined by its purity and mass. Methods used to test the purity of the metal included \u201cpricking\" and \u201cpecking\u201d the surface to test the hardness of the alloy and reveal plating. Determining bullion's mass required the use of weights and scales. Many of the bronze scales used by Viking traders folded on themselves making them compact and easy to carry for travel.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|date=2014|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe two types of weights imported from foreign lands were '''''cubo-octahedral weights''''' (''Dice weights'') and '''''oblate spheroids''''' (''barrel weights''). Both were produced in various sizes with markings indicating the weights they represented. The majority of imported weights came from the Islamic world and contained Arabic inscriptions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\nVikings also produced their own weights for measuring quantities of silver and gold. These lead weights were decorated with enameling, insert coins, or cut up ornamental metalwork.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viking Weight|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=32976b0a-e67c-4f06-9921-782f3ba135d1|website=The National Museum of Ireland}}</ref> Unlike the dice weights or barrel weights, each lead weight was unique so there was no danger of them being rearranged or switched during the course of an exchange.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Exchange rates==\nEstimated exchange rates at the beginning of the 11th century in Iceland were:\n*8 ounces of silver = 1 ounce of gold\n*8 ounces of silver = 4 milk cows\n*8 ounces of silver = 24 sheep\n*8 ounces of silver = 144 ells (roughly 72 meters) of [[wadmal]] 2 ells wide (about 1 meter)\n*12 ounces of silver = 1 adult male slave<ref>{{cite web|title=Towns and Trading in the Viking Age|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/daily_living/text/Towns.htm|website=Hurstwic}}</ref>\n\nIf the weight of a piece of jewelry was more than needed to complete a purchase, it was cut up into smaller bits until the correct weight needed for the transaction was reached. The term [[hack silver]] is used to describe these silver objects.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}</ref> Silver ingots were primarily used for large/high-value transactions. The largest found weights weigh more than 1 kilogram each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\nPrecious metals were also used to display personal wealth and status. For example, [[Rus trader]]s symbolized their wealth through silver [[neck ring]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gareth|first1=Williams|title=Vikings: Life and Legend|date=2007|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}</ref> Silver or gold gifts were often exchanged to secure social and political relationships.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Gareth|title=Viking Money|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Scales and Weights|url=http://teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/viking_scales_and_weights|website=Teaching History.org|publisher=The British Museum}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Graham-Campbell, James, and Gareth Williams.
