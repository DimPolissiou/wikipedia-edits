After gambling away her latest disability check at the local casino, the owner, Sue Lynn, asks Dex to find her runaway granddaughter Nina in return for clearing her debt. Dex accepts the job, but her lack of experience quickly shows, as she finds Nina only to then lose her to two kidnappers and steals a car from a gangster whom she wrongly assumes had something to do with the kidnapping. She meets a police detective, Miles Hoffman, who encourages her to stay away from the case. Shortly thereafter, Sue Lynn fires Dex, claiming Nina has been returned home. Depressed, she goes to Hoffman's apartment and sleeps with him. The next day, while Dex is trying to track down Nina's boyfriend Michael, the kidnappers grab her and drive off; she subdues them and proceeds to rescue Sue Lynn and Nina from an unstable Michael.

Hoffman persuades her not to drop the case, and she strikes a deal with Sue Lynn to get full access to the reservation; Sue Lynn assigns Naomi to shadow her investigation. Based on Dex's intuition that someone within the tribe has a grievance against Sue Lynn, the pair discover that Hollis' nephew is plotting against her, and use it to force Hollis to turn over the names of reservation members expelled by Sue Lynn. Hoffman finds that one of them was a young man kicked out for selling drugs, and arrests him after finding him with a pipe bomb.

Dex's high school nemesis, Penny, hires her when her daughter Jennifer is expelled for selling [[Adderall]], which she swears was planted. Dex goes undercover as a substitute teacher, wiretaps a member of the school's volleyball team, and discovers that the coach was the drug dealer. Grey found out from Ansel that Liz had spent the night with Dex. When Dex cannot be straightforward about what happened, Grey tells her she's not welcome in his bar any longer. Hoffman is hurt as well, but buries his feelings and tells Dex their relationship should be kept professional. The coach is arrested after she's seen buying more pills and tried to flee. Jennifer is cleared, and Penny makes amends with Dex. With video footage provided by Sue Lynn, Grey discovers that Liz intentionally got Dex drunk to destroy their friendship, and he kicks her out.

Dex discovers that Lataurus used the money to purchase rare [[civet|civet cat]]s for pet shop owner Dwaddle Chen, but since the cats were seized by customs officers, he's terrified Chen will kill him. Hoffman is assigned to escort a police captain's wife to a concert; on the way home, her car is stolen and Hoffman uses his leverage on Grey to force him to help find it. Lataurus is abducted, and the judge refuses to pay the ransom, saying that his deadbeat brother isn't worth it. This causes Dex to reevaluate her hostile reaction to Ansel's wanting to leave the house, as she realizes that he's tired of being treated as a child and wants the chance to live like a normal adult. Dex stages a rescue to free Lataurus from Chen, but the judge is shot and decides to give his brother the money to get his cats back after he declines an offer to move in with him.

Grey meets the carjacking ring Hoffman assigned him to, including a young mechanic named Max who he begins to develop feelings for. Ansel starts working on a list of things to do to prove that he's a \"real man\", but Grey tells him that his maturity already makes him that.

Ginger showers Dex with attention and gifts (something strictly prohibited by PI regulations) and attempts to get her to sleep with a dancer. Everything comes to a head when the dancers reveal that they have all been skimming to help a colleague who blames Ginger for his injuries; Ginger refuses to hear Dex out, fires her, and files a complaint accusing her of accepting bribes and demonstrating incompetence, putting her license at risk. Dex goes to her first group meeting, which inspires her to retaliate by filing her own complaints with the city. Impressed by her boldness, Ginger drops the complaint and agrees to address the dancers' concerns. Hoffman sets a trap for Jimmy, correctly guessing he's corrupt.

After gambling away her latest disability check at the local casino, the owner, Sue Lynn, asks Dex to find her runaway granddaughter Nina in return for clearing her debt.

She meets a police detective, Miles Hoffman, who encourages her to stay away from the case. Shortly thereafter, Sue Lynn fires Dex, claiming Nina has been returned home.

Hoffman persuades her not to drop the case, and she strikes a deal with Sue Lynn to get full access to the reservation; Sue Lynn assigns Naomi to shadow her investigation. Based on Dex's intuition that someone within the tribe has a grievance against Sue Lynn, the pair discover that Hollis' nephew is plotting against her, and use it to force Hollis to turn over the names of reservation members expelled by Sue Lynn. Hoffman finds that one of them was a young man kicked out for selling drugs, and arrests him after finding him with a pipe bomb. However, before he can be processed, Sue Lynn exercises her authority as tribal chief to take him into her custody. Hoffman tells Dex that she crossed a line when she included Liz in the names to be investigated. Dex was paid by Sue Lynn with casino chips and she invites Liz to join her for a celebration at the [[craps]] table.

Dex goes undercover as a substitute teacher, wiretaps a member of the school's volleyball team, and discovers that the coach was the drug dealer. Grey found out from Ansel that Liz had spent the night with Dex. When Dex cannot be straightforward about what happened, Grey tells her she's not welcome in his bar any longer. Hoffman is hurt as well, but buries his feelings and tells Dex their relationship should be kept professional. The coach is arrested after she's seen buying more pills and tried to flee.

Hoffman is assigned to escort a police captain's wife to a concert; on the way home, her car is stolen and Hoffman uses his leverage on Grey to force him to help find it. Lataurus is abducted, and the judge refuses to pay the ransom, saying that his deadbeat brother isn't worth it. This causes Dex to reevaluate her hostile reaction to Ansel's wanting to leave the house, as she realizes that he's tired of being treated as a child and wants the chance to live like a normal adult. Dex stages a rescue to free Lataurus from Chen, but the judge is shot and decides to give his brother the money to get his cats back after he declines an offer to move in with him.

Grey meets the carjacking ring Hoffman assigned him to, including a young mechanic named Max who he begins to develop feelings for. Ansel starts working on a list of things to do to prove that he's a \"real man\", but Grey tells him that his maturity already makes him that.

Ginger showers Dex with attention and gifts (something strictly prohibited by PI regulations) and attempts to get her to sleep with a dancer. Everything comes to a head when the dancers reveal that they have all been skimming to help a colleague who blames Ginger for his injuries; Ginger refuses to hear Dex out, fires her, and files a complaint accusing her of accepting bribes and demonstrating incompetence, putting her license at risk. Dex goes to her first group meeting, which inspires her to retaliate by filing her own complaints with the city. Impressed by her boldness, Ginger drops the complaint and agrees to address the dancers' concerns. Hoffman sets a trap for Jimmy, correctly guessing he's corrupt.

The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8&nbsp;May 1835 in Copenhagen by C. A. Reitzel.\n\nAndersen had heard the story as a child, and it likely has its source in folk material, possibly originating from Sweden, as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} Neither \"The Princess and the Pea\" nor Andersen's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics, who disliked their casual, chatty style and their lack of morals.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|pp=159\u2013160|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1959 \"The Princess and the Pea\" was adapted to the [[musical comedy|musical stage]] in a production called ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'' starring [[Carol Burnett]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story tells of a prince who wants to marry a princess but is having difficulty finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets and he cannot be certain they are ''real'' princesses because they have bad table manners or they are not his type. One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She claims to be a princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by huge mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices at her bruised back. A huge wedding takes place in the palace. The prince couldn't believe that he found his true princess. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married. The story ends with the pea being placed in a museum, where according to the story it can still be seen today unless someone has removed it.\n\n==Sources==\nIn his preface to the second volume of ''Tales and Stories'' (1863) Andersen claims to have heard the story in his childhood,{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holbek |first=Bengt |year=1990 |title=Hans Christian Andersen's Use of Folktales |journal=[[Merveilles et Contes]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=220\u201332 |jstor=41380775 |mode=cs2}}</ref> but the tale has never been a traditional one in Denmark.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}} He may as a child have heard a Swedish version, \"Princess Who Lay on Seven Peas\" (\"Princessa' som l\u00e5' p\u00e5 sju \u00e4rter\"), which tells of an orphan girl who establishes her identity after a sympathetic helper (a cat or a dog) informs her that an object (a bean, a pea or a straw) had been placed under her mattress.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}\n\nThe theme of this fairy tale is a repeat of that of the medieval Perso-Arabic legend of [[al-Nadirah]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donzel |first1=E.

Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|<center>[[Hans Christian Andersen|Andersen]] in 1836</center>]]\nAndersen deliberately cultivated a funny and colloquial style in the tales of 1835, reminiscent of oral storytelling techniques rather than the sophisticated literary devices of the fairy tales written by ''[[pr\u00e9cieuses|les pr\u00e9cieuses]]'', [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] and other precursors. The earliest reviews criticized Andersen for not following such models. In the second volume of the 1863 edition of his collected works Andersen remarked in the preface: \"The style should be such that one hears the narrator. Therefore, the language had to be similar to the spoken word; the stories are for children but adults too should be able to listen in.\"{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}}Although no materials appear to exist specifically addressing the composition of \"The Princess and the Pea\", Andersen does speak to the writing of the first four tales of 1835 of which \"The Princess on the Pea\" is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: \"I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know\" and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]]: \"I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about and which I do not believe are known and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a ''child''.\"  Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: \"I have also written some fairy tales for children; [[\u00d8rsted]] says about them that if ''[[The Improvisatore]]'' makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so.\"{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=144|ps=none}} On 26&nbsp;March, he observed that \"[the fairy tales] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world.\"{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=144|ps=none}}\n\n==Publication==\n\"The Princess and the Pea\" was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C.A. Reitzel on 8&nbsp;May 1835 in an unbound 61-page booklet called ''Tales, Told for Children. First Collection. First Booklet. 1835.'' (''Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. F\u00f8rste Samling. F\u00f8rste Hefte. 1835.'').  \"The Princess and the Pea\" was the third tale in the collection, with \"[[The Tinderbox]]\" (\"''Fyrt\u00f8iet''\"), \"Little Claus and Big Claus\" (\"''Lille Claus og store Claus''\") and \"Little Ida's Flowers\" (\"''Den lille Idas Blomster''\"). The booklet was priced at twenty-four shillings (the equivalent of 25&nbsp;Dkr. or approximately US$5 as of 2009),{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}} and the publisher paid Andersen 30&nbsp;[[rixdollar]]s (US$450 as of 2009).{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=144|ps=none}} A second edition was published in 1842 and a third in 1845.{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}}  \"The Princess and the Pea\" was reprinted on 18&nbsp;December 1849 in ''Tales. 1850.'' with illustrations by [[Vilhelm Pedersen]]. The story was published again on 15&nbsp;December 1862, in ''Tales and Stories. First Volume. 1862.''The first Danish reviews of Andersen's 1835 tales appeared in 1836 and were hostile. Critics disliked the informal, chatty style and the lack of morals,{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|pp=159\u2013160|ps=none}} and offered Andersen no encouragement. One literary journal failed to mention the tales at all, while another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing \"wonder stories\". He was told he \"lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry&nbsp;... and would not study models\".  Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be and returned to writing novels, believing it to be his true calling.{{sfnp|Andersen|2000|p=135|ps=none}}\n\n==English translation==\n[[Charles Boner]] was the first to translate \"The Princess and the Pea\" into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=290|ps=none}}  Boner's translation was published as \"The Princess on the Peas\" in ''A Danish Story-Book'' in 1846.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}}  Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, \"Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?\" rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=290|ps=none}} Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, \"continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal\".{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|pp=290\u2013291|ps=none}}\n\n==Commentaries==\nWullschlager observes that in \"The Princess and the Pea\" Andersen blended his childhood memories of a primitive world of violence, death and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept him as one of their own. Researcher [[Jack Zipes]] said that Andersen, during his lifetime, \"was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer\"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and longed to be a part of the upper class.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dewsbury |first=Suzanne |title=Hans Christian Andersen- Introduction |url=http://www.enotes.com/hans-christian-criticism/andersen-hans-christian |work=Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism |publisher=Gale Cengage |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref> The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the [[bourgeoisie]] were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of \"The Princess and the Pea\", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20&nbsp;mattresses.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=151|ps=none}}[[Maria Tatar]] notes that, unlike the folk heroine of his source material for the story, Andersen's princess has no need to resort to deceit to establish her identity; her sensitivity is enough to validate her nobility. For Andersen, she indicates, \"true\" nobility derived not from an individual's birth but from their sensitivity. Andersen's insistence upon sensitivity as the exclusive privilege of nobility challenges modern notions about character and social worth. The princess's sensitivity, however, may be a metaphor for her depth of feeling and compassion.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}While a 1905 article in the American ''Journal of Education'' recommended the story for children aged 8\u201310,<ref>{{cite journal |year=1905 |title=Readings from Andersen| journal=The Journal of Education |volume=61| issue=6 |page=146 |jstor=42806381 |mode=cs2}}</ref> \"The Princess and the Pea\" was not uniformly well received by critics. Toksvig wrote in 1934, \"[the story] seems to the reviewer not only indelicate but indefensible, in so far as the child might absorb the false idea that great ladies must always be so terribly thin-skinned.\"{{sfnp|Toksvig|1934|p=179|ps=none}} Tatar notes that the princess's sensitivity has been interpreted as poor manners rather than a manifestation of noble birth, a view said to be based on \"the cultural association between women's physical sensitivity and emotional sensitivity, specifically, the link between a woman reporting her physical experience of touch and negative images of women who are hypersensitive to physical conditions, who complain about trivialities, and who demand special treatment\".{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}Researcher [[Jack Zipes]] notes that the tale is told tongue-in-cheek, with Andersen poking fun at the \"curious and ridiculous\" measures taken by the nobility to establish the value of bloodlines.  He also notes that the author makes a case for sensitivity being the decisive factor in determining royal authenticity and that Andersen \"never tired of glorifying the sensitive nature of an elite class of people\".{{sfnp|Zipes|2005|p=35|ps=none}}\u201cThe Princess and the Pea\u201d spurred on positive criticism, as well. In fact, critic [[Paul Hazard]] pointed out the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that \"the world Andersen witnessed\u2014which encompassed sorrow, death, evil and man's follies\u2014is reflected in his tales,\" and most evidently in \"The Princess and the Pea.\" Another scholar, [[Niels Kofoed]], noticed that \u201csince they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes and genders.\u201d Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized that one of the things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dewsbury |first=Suzanne |title=Hans Christian Andersen\u2014Introduction |url=http://www.enotes.com/hans-christian-criticism/andersen-hans-christian|work=Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism |publisher=Gale Cengage |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1927, German composer [[Ernst Toch]] published an opera based on \"The Princess and the Pea\", with a libretto by [[Benno Elkan]].<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Frederic |year=1954 |title=The Princess and the Pea.

A crooked red mark is discovered on his body and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}}  An Italian tale called \"The Most Sensitive Woman\" tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The [[Brothers Grimm]] included a \"Princess on the Pea\" tale in an edition of their ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw and is therefore of aristocratic blood.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} In the more popular versions of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions can be seen in various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all and the princess decides to lie all on her own.<ref>{{cite web |last=Heiner |first=Heidi Anne |title=History of The Princess and the Pea |url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/princesspea/history.html |work=SurLaLune Fairy Tales |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em|refs=}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Hans Christian |authorlink=Hans Christian Andersen |year=2000 |origyear=1871 |title=The Fairy Tale of My Life: An Autobiography |publisher=Cooper Square Press |isbn=0-8154-1105-7|mode=cs2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |last=de Mylius |first=Johan |year=2009 |title=The Timetable Year By Year, 1835: The First Collection of Fairy-Tales |work=H.C.

The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8&nbsp;May 1835 in Copenhagen by C. A. Reitzel.\n\nAndersen had heard the story as a child, and it likely has its source in folk material, possibly originating from Sweden, as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} Neither \"The Princess and the Pea\" nor Andersen's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics, who disliked their casual, chatty style and their lack of morals.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|pp=159\u2013160|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1959 \"The Princess and the Pea\" was adapted to the [[musical comedy|musical stage]] in a production called ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'' starring [[Carol Burnett]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story tells of a prince who wants to marry a princess but is having difficulty finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets and he cannot be certain they are ''real'' princesses because they have bad table manners or they are not his type. One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She claims to be a princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by huge mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices at her bruised back. A huge wedding takes place in the palace. The prince couldn't believe that he found his true princess. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married. The story ends with the pea being placed in a museum, where according to the story it can still be seen today unless someone has removed it.\n\n==Sources==\nIn his preface to the second volume of ''Tales and Stories'' (1863) Andersen claims to have heard the story in his childhood,{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holbek |first=Bengt |year=1990 |title=Hans Christian Andersen's Use of Folktales |journal=[[Merveilles et Contes]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=220\u201332 |jstor=41380775 |mode=cs2}}</ref> but the tale has never been a traditional one in Denmark.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}} He may as a child have heard a Swedish version, \"Princess Who Lay on Seven Peas\" (\"Princessa' som l\u00e5' p\u00e5 sju \u00e4rter\"), which tells of an orphan girl who establishes her identity after a sympathetic helper (a cat or a dog) informs her that an object (a bean, a pea or a straw) had been placed under her mattress.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}\n\nThe theme of this fairy tale is a repeat of that of the medieval Perso-Arabic legend of [[al-Nadirah]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Donzel |first1=E.

T. A. Hoffmann]] and other precursors. The earliest reviews criticized Andersen for not following such models. In the second volume of the 1863 edition of his collected works Andersen remarked in the preface: \"The style should be such that one hears the narrator. Therefore, the language had to be similar to the spoken word; the stories are for children but adults too should be able to listen in.\"{{sfnp|de Mylius|2009|ps=none}}Although no materials appear to exist specifically addressing the composition of \"The Princess and the Pea\", Andersen does speak to the writing of the first four tales of 1835 of which \"The Princess on the Pea\" is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: \"I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know\" and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]]: \"I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded.

Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be and returned to writing novels, believing it to be his true calling.{{sfnp|Andersen|2000|p=135|ps=none}}\n\n==English translation==\n[[Charles Boner]] was the first to translate \"The Princess and the Pea\" into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=290|ps=none}}  Boner's translation was published as \"The Princess on the Peas\" in ''A Danish Story-Book'' in 1846.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}}  Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, \"Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?\" rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=290|ps=none}} Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, \"continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal\".{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|pp=290\u2013291|ps=none}}\n\n==Commentaries==\nWullschlager observes that in \"The Princess and the Pea\" Andersen blended his childhood memories of a primitive world of violence, death and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept him as one of their own. Researcher [[Jack Zipes]] said that Andersen, during his lifetime, \"was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer\"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and longed to be a part of the upper class.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dewsbury |first=Suzanne |title=Hans Christian Andersen- Introduction |url=http://www.enotes.com/hans-christian-criticism/andersen-hans-christian |work=Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism |publisher=Gale Cengage |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref> The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the [[bourgeoisie]] were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of \"The Princess and the Pea\", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20&nbsp;mattresses.{{sfnp|Wullschlager|2000|p=151|ps=none}}[[Maria Tatar]] notes that, unlike the folk heroine of his source material for the story, Andersen's princess has no need to resort to deceit to establish her identity; her sensitivity is enough to validate her nobility. For Andersen, she indicates, \"true\" nobility derived not from an individual's birth but from their sensitivity. Andersen's insistence upon sensitivity as the exclusive privilege of nobility challenges modern notions about character and social worth. The princess's sensitivity, however, may be a metaphor for her depth of feeling and compassion.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}While a 1905 article in the American ''Journal of Education'' recommended the story for children aged 8\u201310,<ref>{{cite journal |year=1905 |title=Readings from Andersen| journal=The Journal of Education |volume=61| issue=6 |page=146 |jstor=42806381 |mode=cs2}}</ref> \"The Princess and the Pea\" was not uniformly well received by critics. Toksvig wrote in 1934, \"[the story] seems to the reviewer not only indelicate but indefensible, in so far as the child might absorb the false idea that great ladies must always be so terribly thin-skinned.\"{{sfnp|Toksvig|1934|p=179|ps=none}} Tatar notes that the princess's sensitivity has been interpreted as poor manners rather than a manifestation of noble birth, a view said to be based on \"the cultural association between women's physical sensitivity and emotional sensitivity, specifically, the link between a woman reporting her physical experience of touch and negative images of women who are hypersensitive to physical conditions, who complain about trivialities, and who demand special treatment\".{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}}Researcher [[Jack Zipes]] notes that the tale is told tongue-in-cheek, with Andersen poking fun at the \"curious and ridiculous\" measures taken by the nobility to establish the value of bloodlines.  He also notes that the author makes a case for sensitivity being the decisive factor in determining royal authenticity and that Andersen \"never tired of glorifying the sensitive nature of an elite class of people\".{{sfnp|Zipes|2005|p=35|ps=none}}\u201cThe Princess and the Pea\u201d spurred on positive criticism, as well. In fact, critic [[Paul Hazard]] pointed out the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that \"the world Andersen witnessed\u2014which encompassed sorrow, death, evil and man's follies\u2014is reflected in his tales,\" and most evidently in \"The Princess and the Pea.\" Another scholar, [[Niels Kofoed]], noticed that \u201csince they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes and genders.\u201d Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized that one of the things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dewsbury |first=Suzanne |title=Hans Christian Andersen\u2014Introduction |url=http://www.enotes.com/hans-christian-criticism/andersen-hans-christian|work=Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism |publisher=Gale Cengage |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1927, German composer [[Ernst Toch]] published an opera based on \"The Princess and the Pea\", with a libretto by [[Benno Elkan]].<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Frederic |year=1954 |title=The Princess and the Pea.

As early as the 1st century, [[Seneca the Younger]] had mentioned a legend about a Sybaris native who slept on a bed of roses and suffered due to one petal folding over.<ref>[http://en.antiquitatem.com/bed-of-roses-princess-and-pea-andersen A Bed of Roses]</ref> The 11th-century ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' by [[Somadeva]] tells of a young man who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed.{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1974|p=216|ps=none}}  An Italian tale called \"The Most Sensitive Woman\" tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The [[Brothers Grimm]] included a \"Princess on the Pea\" tale in an edition of their ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw and is therefore of aristocratic blood.{{sfnp|Tatar|2008|pp=70\u201377|ps=none}} In the more popular versions of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions can be seen in various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all and the princess decides to lie all on her own.<ref>{{cite web |last=Heiner |first=Heidi Anne |title=History of The Princess and the Pea |url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/princesspea/history.html |work=SurLaLune Fairy Tales |accessdate=3 May 2012 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em|refs=}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Hans Christian |authorlink=Hans Christian Andersen |year=2000 |origyear=1871 |title=The Fairy Tale of My Life: An Autobiography |publisher=Cooper Square Press |isbn=0-8154-1105-7|mode=cs2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |last=de Mylius |first=Johan |year=2009 |title=The Timetable Year By Year, 1835: The First Collection of Fairy-Tales |work=H.C.
