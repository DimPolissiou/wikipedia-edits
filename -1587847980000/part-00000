The house cost $4,000 and was completed by the end of the year. It is not certain who was tasked with building the structure, as C.

After completion, the house appeared in \"Plaster Houses and their Construction\", an article in ''[[House Beautiful]]'' in September 1905. The house was also part of Wright's [[Wasmuth Portfolio]]. The Walsers lived in the house for seven years. In 1910, when the Walsers moved six blocks east, the house was sold to George Donnersberger. Since then, the house has had a dozen owners, although it has remained in the hands of the Teague family since 1970.

The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current {{convert|14.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}-diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} first stage for greater range with a second \"kick stage\" to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of 2020, THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes that the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries.<ref name=\"aviationweek8jan15\">[http://aviationweek.com/defense/china-s-hypersonic-ambitions-prompt-thaad-er-push \"China's Hypersonic Ambitions Prompt Thaad-ER Push\"].

The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current {{convert|14.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}-diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} first stage for greater range with a second \"kick stage\" to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of 2020, THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes that the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries.<ref name=\"aviationweek8jan15\">[http://aviationweek.com/defense/china-s-hypersonic-ambitions-prompt-thaad-er-push \"China's Hypersonic Ambitions Prompt Thaad-ER Push\"].

He won three [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) championships with the [[Canberra Cannons]] before going on to be a three-time championship-winning [[head coach]] of the NBL's [[Adelaide 36ers]]. Smyth was a four-time Olympian with the [[Australian national basketball team]].\n\n==Professional career==\nSmyth, an Adelaide junior, was already seen as one of Australia's best [[point guard]]s when the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] first started in 1979, yet it took him until 1982 to actually play in the league, despite having represented Australia at the [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] in the [[Philippines]] and at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]].\n\nFor personal reasons, Smyth chose not to play in the NBL until 1982 and even then, while still living in Adelaide, he signed to play with the [[St Kilda Saints (NBL)|St Kilda Saints]], commuting between his home in Adelaide and [[Melbourne]] where the Saints were based. He only played for St Kilda for the [[1982 NBL season]], winning the [[NBL (Australia) Best Defensive Player|NBL's Defensive Player of the Year]] award and selection in the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL Teams|NBL's First Team]] in the process before signing with the [[Canberra Cannons]] from 1983. At this time he also moved from Adelaide to Canberra for what would prove to be 10 seasons in Australia's [[Canberra|capital city]]. During that time he enhanced his reputation as one of the best ever Australian basketball players and helped transform the Cannons into a championship winning team.\n\nCanberra won their first NBL Championship in 1983, Smyth's first season with the club. The Cannons defeated the defending champion [[West Adelaide Bearcats]] 75-73 in the grand final. They would go on to win the championship again in 1984, this time defeating the emerging [[Brisbane Bullets]] 84-82 in another closely fought grand final win. Smyth's play during this time was a major contributor to Canberra's success. He won his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year award in 1983 and was also a member of the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL Teams|ALL NBL First team]] in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989.\n\nSmyth would win his 3rd NBL Championship when the Cannons defeated the [[North Melbourne Giants]] in the 1988 grand final series two games to one. He would also be named as the [[NBL (Australia) Most Valuable Player - Grand Final|Grand Final MVP]] in 1988. He narrowly missed out on a fourth NBL crown in 1989 when the Giants reversed the 1988 result by defeating Canberra two games to one.\n\nHe would play on with the Cannons until the end of the 1992 NBL season when he was lured back home to Adelaide to play for the Adelaide 36ers. Despite being in the twilight of his playing career, Smyth would again be a major contributor helping the generally under-performing 36ers get back into the playoffs. Smyth played two seasons for the 36ers and would lose his second and last NBL grand final series in 1994, again to the North Melbourne Giants who defeated Adelaide 2-0 in the championship series.\n\nAfter two season back home in Adelaide, Smyth had a falling out with 36ers coach [[Mike Dunlap]] who had a reputation for favouring the younger players. During 1994 Dunlap had even begun to start 3rd year player [[Brett Maher (basketball)|Brett Maher]] as the 36ers point guard and playing Smyth from the bench despite Smyth still being the starting point guard for the Australian Boomers (when Smyth questioned Dunlap on why he was benched, Dunlap told him that it was simply because he was old). This saw Smyth sign for the NBL's highest profile club, the [[Sydney Kings]] for the 1995 season where he linked with his former Canberra championship winning coach Bob Turner. In an injury interrupted season, Smyth played just 16 games for the Kings, who didn't make the playoffs. He retired from playing professional basketball after his season with the Kings.\n\nPhil Smyth played 356 games in his NBL career, 25 with St Kilda, 282 with Canberra, 33 for Adelaide and 16 for Sydney. He averaged 22.3 points per game at 44.8%, 5.3 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.8 steals.\n\n==International career==\nSmyth represented Australia at four [[Summer Olympic Games]] ([[Basketball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] and [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]]), achieving a best result of 4th at the 1988 Games in [[Seoul]] where he was the team captain. He was also a member of the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] at the [[FIBA World Championship]]s in [[1978 FIBA World Championship|1978]], [[1982 FIBA World Championship|1982]], [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]], [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990]] and [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994]] with a best result of 5th place in both 1982 and 1994. At the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games]], Smyth and his wife, [[Jenny Cheesman]], would become the first husband and wife to captain Australian teams at the same Olympics.<ref>[http://basketball.net.au/index.php?id=302&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=59&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1323&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=615&cHash=cfb495f2fb Back in the Day: Late Autumn 1984]. Basketball Australia News (May 18, 2010). Retrieved 2012-09-02.</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter Adelaide 36ers coach Dave Claxton failed to take the team to the playoffs in 1997, the club hired the recently retired Smyth as head coach of the team from the [[1998 NBL season]], the club banking on his years of experience as a player despite his only previous coaching experience being as a specialist coach at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) during his playing days with Canberra as well as coaching [[South Adelaide Basketball Club|South Adelaide]] women's teams in the early 1980s.\n\nSmyth's impact on the club was immediate, with the 36ers winning both the 1998 and [[1998\u201399 NBL season|1998\u201399 NBL Championships]] in his first two seasons coaching in the league (according to Smyth, the 36ers coaching job in 1998 came down to himself and former North Melbourne and Brisbane coach [[Bruce Palmer (basketball)|Bruce Palmer]], but the 36ers ultimately wanted someone local). The team was beaten semi finalists for the next two seasons before winning their 4th championship, and 3rd under Smyth, in [[2001\u201302 NBL season|2001\u201302]]. Under his coaching the team would reach the elimination finals in [[2002\u201303 NBL season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304]] and improve to the quarters in [[2004-05 NBL season|2004-05]] and [[2005\u201306 NBL season|2005\u201306]] before failing to reach the playoffs twice which resulted in Smyth being replaced as head coach by former player and assistant Scott Ninnis.\n\nIn all, Phil Smyth coached the 36ers in the NBL for 365 games over 11 seasons, winning 205 games and losing 160.\n\nFollowing his stellar international career as a player and his championship success coaching the 36ers, Smyth was appointed head coach of the Boomers in January 2001. Unfortunately his international coaching career only lasted eight months. After losing the [[FIBA Oceania Championship 2001|2001 FIBA Oceania Championship]] to the [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand Tall Blacks]] 1-2 the team failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Indianapolis]] as a result. It was the first time Australia had missed out on the [[FIBA World Championship]] since making their championship debut in [[1970 FIBA World Championship|1970]]. Smyth resigned from the job on 27 September 2001 and was ultimately replaced by the man who he defeated to win both the 1998 and 1998\u201399 NBL Championships, [[Brian Goorjian]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-47178963.html HighBeam]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Media work==\nIn March 2009 Smyth joined radio and sporting legend [[K. G. Cunningham]] to host an internet sports show KG and the General, streaming live from 3-6pm weekdays and podcast.\n\n==Honours==\nSmyth was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1988, inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1997, and received an [[Australian Sports Medal]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite

1958)<ref>https://www.olympic.org/philip-smyth</ref> is an Australian former professional [[basketball]] player and coach. He won three [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) championships with the [[Canberra Cannons]] before going on to be a three-time championship-winning [[head coach]] of the NBL's [[Adelaide 36ers]]. Smyth was a four-time Olympian with the [[Australian national basketball team]].\n\n==Professional career==\nSmyth, an Adelaide junior, was already seen as one of Australia's best [[point guard]]s when the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] first started in 1979, yet it took him until 1982 to actually play in the league, despite having represented Australia at the [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] in the [[Philippines]] and at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]].\n\nFor personal reasons, Smyth chose not to play in the NBL until 1982 and even then, while still living in Adelaide, he signed to play with the [[St Kilda Saints (NBL)|St Kilda Saints]], commuting between his home in Adelaide and [[Melbourne]] where the Saints were based. He only played for St Kilda for the [[1982 NBL season]], winning the [[NBL (Australia) Best Defensive Player|NBL's Defensive Player of the Year]] award and selection in the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL Teams|NBL's First Team]] in the process before signing with the [[Canberra Cannons]] from 1983. At this time he also moved from Adelaide to Canberra for what would prove to be 10 seasons in Australia's [[Canberra|capital city]]. During that time he enhanced his reputation as one of the best ever Australian basketball players and helped transform the Cannons into a championship winning team.\n\nCanberra won their first NBL Championship in 1983, Smyth's first season with the club. The Cannons defeated the defending champion [[West Adelaide Bearcats]] 75-73 in the grand final. They would go on to win the championship again in 1984, this time defeating the emerging [[Brisbane Bullets]] 84-82 in another closely fought grand final win. Smyth's play during this time was a major contributor to Canberra's success. He won his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year award in 1983 and was also a member of the [[NBL (Australia) All NBL Teams|ALL NBL First team]] in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989.\n\nSmyth would win his 3rd NBL Championship when the Cannons defeated the [[North Melbourne Giants]] in the 1988 grand final series two games to one. He would also be named as the [[NBL (Australia) Most Valuable Player - Grand Final|Grand Final MVP]] in 1988. He narrowly missed out on a fourth NBL crown in 1989 when the Giants reversed the 1988 result by defeating Canberra two games to one.\n\nHe would play on with the Cannons until the end of the 1992 NBL season when he was lured back home to Adelaide to play for the Adelaide 36ers. Despite being in the twilight of his playing career, Smyth would again be a major contributor helping the generally under-performing 36ers get back into the playoffs. Smyth played two seasons for the 36ers and would lose his second and last NBL grand final series in 1994, again to the North Melbourne Giants who defeated Adelaide 2-0 in the championship series.\n\nAfter two season back home in Adelaide, Smyth had a falling out with 36ers coach [[Mike Dunlap]] who had a reputation for favouring the younger players. During 1994 Dunlap had even begun to start 3rd year player [[Brett Maher (basketball)|Brett Maher]] as the 36ers point guard and playing Smyth from the bench despite Smyth still being the starting point guard for the Australian Boomers (when Smyth questioned Dunlap on why he was benched, Dunlap told him that it was simply because he was old). This saw Smyth sign for the NBL's highest profile club, the [[Sydney Kings]] for the 1995 season where he linked with his former Canberra championship winning coach Bob Turner. In an injury interrupted season, Smyth played just 16 games for the Kings, who didn't make the playoffs. He retired from playing professional basketball after his season with the Kings.\n\nPhil Smyth played 356 games in his NBL career, 25 with St Kilda, 282 with Canberra, 33 for Adelaide and 16 for Sydney. He averaged 22.3 points per game at 44.8%, 5.3 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.8 steals.\n\n==International career==\nSmyth represented Australia at four [[Summer Olympic Games]] ([[Basketball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] and [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]]), achieving a best result of 4th at the 1988 Games in [[Seoul]] where he was the team captain. He was also a member of the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] at the [[FIBA World Championship]]s in [[1978 FIBA World Championship|1978]], [[1982 FIBA World Championship|1982]], [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]], [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990]] and [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994]] with a best result of 5th place in both 1982 and 1994. At the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games]], Smyth and his wife, [[Jenny Cheesman]], would become the first husband and wife to captain Australian teams at the same Olympics.<ref>[http://basketball.net.au/index.php?id=302&tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=59&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1323&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=615&cHash=cfb495f2fb Back in the Day: Late Autumn 1984]. Basketball Australia News (May 18, 2010). Retrieved 2012-09-02.</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter Adelaide 36ers coach Dave Claxton failed to take the team to the playoffs in 1997, the club hired the recently retired Smyth as head coach of the team from the [[1998 NBL season]], the club banking on his years of experience as a player despite his only previous coaching experience being as a specialist coach at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) during his playing days with Canberra as well as coaching [[South Adelaide Basketball Club|South Adelaide]] women's teams in the early 1980s.\n\nSmyth's impact on the club was immediate, with the 36ers winning both the 1998 and [[1998\u201399 NBL season|1998\u201399 NBL Championships]] in his first two seasons coaching in the league (according to Smyth, the 36ers coaching job in 1998 came down to himself and former North Melbourne and Brisbane coach [[Bruce Palmer (basketball)|Bruce Palmer]], but the 36ers ultimately wanted someone local). The team was beaten semi finalists for the next two seasons before winning their 4th championship, and 3rd under Smyth, in [[2001\u201302 NBL season|2001\u201302]]. Under his coaching the team would reach the elimination finals in [[2002\u201303 NBL season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304]] and improve to the quarters in [[2004-05 NBL season|2004-05]] and [[2005\u201306 NBL season|2005\u201306]] before failing to reach the playoffs twice which resulted in Smyth being replaced as head coach by former player and assistant Scott Ninnis.\n\nIn all, Phil Smyth coached the 36ers in the NBL for 365 games over 11 seasons, winning 205 games and losing 160.\n\nFollowing his stellar international career as a player and his championship success coaching the 36ers, Smyth was appointed head coach of the Boomers in January 2001. Unfortunately his international coaching career only lasted eight months. After losing the [[FIBA Oceania Championship 2001|2001 FIBA Oceania Championship]] to the [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand Tall Blacks]] 1-2 the team failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Indianapolis]] as a result. It was the first time Australia had missed out on the [[FIBA World Championship]] since making their championship debut in [[1970 FIBA World Championship|1970]]. Smyth resigned from the job on 27 September 2001 and was ultimately replaced by the man who he defeated to win both the 1998 and 1998\u201399 NBL Championships, [[Brian Goorjian]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-47178963.html HighBeam]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Media work==\nIn March 2009 Smyth joined radio and sporting legend [[K. G. Cunningham]] to host an internet sports show KG and the General, streaming live from 3-6pm weekdays and podcast.\n\n==Honours==\nSmyth was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1988, inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1997, and received an [[Australian Sports Medal]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite

[[Plantar]] surface.]]\n[[File:Female feet.jpg|thumb|Female toes.]]\n[[File:Toe ring (1).jpg|thumb|The underside of a woman's toes wearing a [[toe ring]] on the second toe.]]\n\nThere are five toes present on each human foot. Each toe consists of three [[phalanx bone]]s, the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal, middle and distal]], with the exception of the big toe ({{lang-la|Hallux}}). For a minority of people, the little toe also is missing a middle bone. The hallux only contains two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal. The joints between each phalanx are the [[Interphalangeal joints of foot|interphalangeal joints]]. The proximal phalanx bone of each toe articulates with the [[metatarsal]] bone of the foot at the [[Metatarsophalangeal joints|metatarsophalangeal joint]]. Each toe is surrounded by skin, and present on all five toes is a [[toenail]].\n\nThe toes are, from [[Medial (anatomy)|medial to lateral]]: \n\n* the first toe, also known as the hallux (\"big toe\", \"great toe\", \"thumb toe\"), the innermost toe;\n* the second toe, (\"long toe\", \"pointer toe\", \"index toe\");\n* the third toe, (\"middle toe\", \"long toe\");\n* the fourth toe, (\"fore toe\"); and\n* the fifth toe, (\"baby toe\", \"little toe\", \"pinky toe\" \"small toe\", \"tiny toe\", \"wee toe\"), the outermost toe.\n\n===Muscles===\n{{See also|Foot#Muscles}}\nToe movement is generally [[Anatomical terms of movement#Flexion and extension|flexion and extension]] via muscular [[tendon]]s that attach to the toes on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and superior|anterior and superior]] surfaces of the phalanx bones.<ref name=\"GRAYS2005\">{{cite book|title=Gray's anatomy for students|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|author2=Vogl, Wayne|author3=Tibbitts, Adam W.M.

Additional flexion control is provided by the [[flexor hallucis brevis]]. It is extended by the [[abductor hallucis muscle]] and the [[adductor hallucis muscle]]. \n* The little toe has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments, the [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor]] and [[abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor]] digiti minimi. Numerous other [[:Category:Foot muscles|foot muscles]] contribute to fine motor control of the foot. The connective tendons between the minor toes account for the inability to actuate individual toes.\n\n===Blood supply===\nThe toes receive blood from the digital branches of the [[plantar metatarsal artery|plantar metatarsal arteries]] and drain blood into the [[dorsal venous arch]] of the foot.<ref name=GRAYS2005 />{{rp|580\u201381}}\n\n===Nerve supply===\nSensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves. The [[superficial fibular nerve]] supplies sensation to the top of the toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the [[deep fibular nerve]], and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the [[sural nerve]]. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the [[medial plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes, and the [[lateral plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.\n\nIn [[human]]s, the hallux is usually longer than the second toe, but in some individuals, it may not be the longest toe. There is an [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] trait in humans, where the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[gene]] causes a longer second toe (\"[[Morton's toe]]\" or \"Greek foot\") while the [[Zygosity|homozygous]] recessive [[genotype]] presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux.<ref>{{OMIM|189200|Toes&nbsp;\u2013 relative lengths of first and second}}</ref> People with the rare genetic disease [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]] characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.\n\n===Variation===\nHumans usually have five toes on each foot.

Hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or \u201cbuckling\u201d of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain. Deformities of the foot can also be caused by [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[diabetes mellitus]]. Deformities may predispose to [[ulcer]]s and pain, especially when shoe-wearing.\n\nA common problem involving the big toe is the formation of [[bunion]]s.

The various cartilaginous or bony radii that are found in large numbers in each fin correspond to the fingers of toes of the higher Vertebrates. The several joints of each fin-radius correspond to the various parts of the toe. Even in the Dipneusta the fin is of the same construction as in the fishes; it was afterwards gradually evolved into the five-toed form, which we first encounter in the Amphibia. The reduction of the number of toes to six, and then to five, probably took place in the second half of the Devonian period - at the latest, in the subsequent Carboniferous period - in those Dipneusta which we regard as the ancestors of the Amphibia. [...] The fact that the toes number five is of great importance, because they have clearly been transmitted from the Amphibia to all the higher Vertebrates. Man entirely resembles his amphibian ancestors in this respect, and indeed in the whole structure of the bony skeleton of his five-toed extremities. A careful comparison of the skeleton of the frog with our own is enough to show this. [...] There is absolutely no reason why there should be five toes in the fore and hind feet in the lowest Amphibia, the reptiles, and the higher Vertebrates, unless we ascribe it to inheritance from a common stem-form. Heredity alone can explain it. It is true that we find less than five toes in many of the Amphibia and of the higher Vertebrates. But in all these cases we can prove that some of the toes atrophied, and were in time lost altogether.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nIn [[bird]]s with [[anisodactyl]] or [[heterodactyl]] feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.\n\nWhile the thumb is often mentioned{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all [[primates]].

A sprain or strain where the toe joins to the foot is called [[turf toe]].\n\nLong-term use of improperly sized shoes can cause misalignment of toes, as well as other orthopedic problems.\n\n[[Morton's neuroma]] commonly results in pain and numbness between the third and fourth toes of the sufferer, due to it affecting the nerve between the third and fourth metatarsal bones.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.patient.info/health/Morton%27s-Neuroma.htm | title=Morton's Neuroma | accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe big toe is also the most common locus of [[ingrown nail]]s and the proximal phalanx joint of the hallux is the most common locus for [[gout]] attacks.\n\n===Deformity===\n{{Main|Hammer toe|Bunion}}\nDeformities of the foot include [[hammer toe]], trigger toe, and claw toe. Hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or \u201cbuckling\u201d of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain. Deformities of the foot can also be caused by [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[diabetes mellitus]]. Deformities may predispose to [[ulcer]]s and pain, especially when shoe-wearing.\n\nA common problem involving the big toe is the formation of [[bunion]]s. These are structural deformities of the bones and the [[joint]] between the foot and big toe, and may be painful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footphysicians.com/footankleinfo/bunions.htm |author=American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons |title=Bunions |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> Similar deformity involving the [[fifth toe]] is described as [[tailor's bunion]] or bunionette.\n\n===In reconstruction===\nA favourable option for the reconstruction of missing adjacent fingers<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2780906 |year=1989 |last1=Wei |first1=Fu-Chan |last2=Colony |first2=Lee H. |last3=Chen |first3=Hung-Chi |last4=Chuang |first4=Chwei-Chin |last5=Noordhoff |first5=Samuel M. |title=Combined Second and Third Toe Transfer |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=651\u201361 |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |doi=10.1097/00006534-198984040-00016}}</ref>/multiple digit amputations, i.e. such as a metacarpal hand reconstruction, is to have a combined second and third toe transplantation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00006534-199812000-00021 |pmid=9858177 |title=Single versus Double Arterial Anastomoses in Combined Second- and Third-Toe Transplantation |year=1998 |last1=Cheng |first1=Ming-Huei |last2=Wei |first2=Fu-Chan |last3=Santamaria |first3=Eric |last4=Cheng |first4=Shao-Lung |last5=Lin |first5=Chih-Hung |last6=Chen |first6=Samuel H.

The various cartilaginous or bony radii that are found in large numbers in each fin correspond to the fingers of toes of the higher Vertebrates. The several joints of each fin-radius correspond to the various parts of the toe. Even in the Dipneusta the fin is of the same construction as in the fishes; it was afterwards gradually evolved into the five-toed form, which we first encounter in the Amphibia. The reduction of the number of toes to six, and then to five, probably took place in the second half of the Devonian period - at the latest, in the subsequent Carboniferous period - in those Dipneusta which we regard as the ancestors of the Amphibia. [...] The fact that the toes number five is of great importance, because they have clearly been transmitted from the Amphibia to all the higher Vertebrates. Man entirely resembles his amphibian ancestors in this respect, and indeed in the whole structure of the bony skeleton of his five-toed extremities. A careful comparison of the skeleton of the frog with our own is enough to show this. [...] There is absolutely no reason why there should be five toes in the fore and hind feet in the lowest Amphibia, the reptiles, and the higher Vertebrates, unless we ascribe it to inheritance from a common stem-form. Heredity alone can explain it. It is true that we find less than five toes in many of the Amphibia and of the higher Vertebrates. But in all these cases we can prove that some of the toes atrophied, and were in time lost altogether.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nIn [[bird]]s with [[anisodactyl]] or [[heterodactyl]] feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.\n\nWhile the thumb is often mentioned{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all [[primates]].

I am particularly concerned by the situation of Mr Lee Po, a British citizen. The full facts of the case remain unclear, but our current information indicates that Mr Lee was involuntarily removed to the mainland without any due process under Hong Kong SAR law. This constitutes a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d which assures Hong Kong residents of the protection of the Hong Kong legal system. We have called, in our contacts with the Chinese government at the highest level, for Mr Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong. We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong SAR governments to reassure the people of Hong Kong that law enforcement in the Hong Kong SAR is exclusively the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will continue to be fully protected, and respected by all, in accordance with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.\"<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499940/The_Six_Monthly_Report_on_Hong_Kong_-_1_July_to_31_December_2015.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%8B%B1%E5%A4%96%E7%9B%B8%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E9%A1%98%E9%81%A3%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E9%81%95%E5%8F%8D%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=\u82f1\u5916\u76f8\u767c\u8868\u5831\u544a\uff1a\u674e\u6ce2\u88ab\u975e\u81ea\u9858\u9063\u9001\u4e2d\u570b\u3000\u806f\u7d61\u5317\u4eac\u6700\u9ad8\u5c64\u4fc3\u653e\u4eba &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of first bookstore\u2019s stocks ===\nUp until the disappearances, the first bookstore maintained a stock of books for sale \u2013 in excess of 100,000 units \u2013 in two warehouses.

Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, \"Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office.

Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]]. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (the first in the Dollars Trilogy).<ref name=TG>{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Forget the Spaghetti Western \u2013 try a Curry Western or a Sauerkraut one|author=Billson, Anne|date=September 15, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11096814/Forget-the-Spaghetti-Western-try-a-Curry-Western-or-a-Sauerkraut-one.html}}</ref>\n\n====Snow Western====\nThe Snow Western subgenre is a Western based during midwinter to late winter, and set in the [[continental United States]]. It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western.

Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

I will save her!'\" (1908)]]\n\n==Visual art==\n{{Main|Artists of the American West}}\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[neckerchief]] [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, vests, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s, and [[buckskins]] (alternatively [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]]). Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, \"Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office.

Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]]. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (the first in the Dollars Trilogy).<ref name=TG>{{cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Forget the Spaghetti Western \u2013 try a Curry Western or a Sauerkraut one|author=Billson, Anne|date=September 15, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11096814/Forget-the-Spaghetti-Western-try-a-Curry-Western-or-a-Sauerkraut-one.html}}</ref>\n\n====Snow Western====\nThe Snow Western subgenre is a Western based during midwinter to late winter, and set in the [[continental United States]]. It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western.

Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared. Raising her hands, she exclaimed, 'Go back, Young Wild West. I will save her!'\" (1908)]]\n\n==Visual art==\n{{Main|Artists of the American West}}\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series. Examples include ''[[League of STEAM]]'', ''[[Red Bird (web series)|Red Bird]]'' and [[Arkansas Traveler (web series)|''Arkansas Traveler'']].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n*[[5-in-1 blank cartridge|5-in-1 Blank Cartridges]]\n*[[AFI's 10 Top 10#Western|AFI'S 10 Top 10]]\n*[[Boss of the plains]]\n*[[Cowboy]]\n*[[Crime fiction]]\n*[[Dime Western]]\n*[[Golden Boot Awards]]\n*[[Movie ranches|History of Movie Ranches]]\n*[[History of United States continental expansion]]\n*[[:Category:Native American history|Native American History]]\n*[[:Category:Native American history of California|Native American history of California]]\n*[[Sombrero]]\n*[[TV Western]]\n*[[Wild West shows]]\n*[[Film genre|List of film genres]]\n*[[List of genres]]\n*[[List of Western computer and video games]]\n*[[List of Western fiction authors]]\n*[[Lists of Western films]]\n*[[Western lifestyle]]\n*[[Western Writers of America]]\n*[[Earl W.
