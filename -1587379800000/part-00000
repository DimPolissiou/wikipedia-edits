In modern times, various schools of [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]] have offered theories about the meaning and purpose of dreams. Most people currently appear to interpret dream content according to [[The Interpretation of Dreams|Freudian psychoanalysis]] in the [[United States]], [[India]], and [[South Korea]], according to a study conducted in those countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople appear to believe dreams are particularly meaningful: they assign more meaning to dreams than to similar waking thoughts. For example, people report they would be more likely to cancel a trip they had planned that involved a plane flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before than if the Department of Homeland Security issued a Federal warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, people do not attribute equal importance to all dreams. People appear to use [[motivated reasoning]] when interpreting their dreams.

[[Hieroglyph]]ics depicting dreams and their interpretations are evident. Dreams have been held in considerable importance through history by most cultures.\n\n===Classical Antiquity===\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] constructed temples they called [[Asclepieion]]s, where sick people were sent to be cured. It was believed that cures would be effected through [[divine grace]] by [[incubation (ritual)|incubating dreams]] within the confines of the temple. Dreams were also considered prophetic or [[omen]]s of particular significance. [[Artemidorus]] of Daldis, who lived in the 2nd century AD, wrote a comprehensive text ''Oneirocritica (The Interpretation of Dreams)''.<ref>Artemidorus (1990) The Interpretation of Dreams: Oneirocritica. White, R., trans., Torrance, CA: Original Books, 2nd Edition.</ref> Although Artemidorus believed that dreams can predict the future, he presaged many contemporary approaches to dreams. He thought that the meaning of a dream image could involve puns and could be understood by decoding the image into its component words. For example, Alexander, while waging war against the Tyrians, dreamt that a satyr was dancing on his shield. Artemidorus reports that this dream was interpreted as follows: satyr = ''sa tyros'' (\"Tyre will be thine\"), predicting that Alexander would be triumphant. Freud acknowledged this example of Artemidorus when he proposed that dreams be interpreted like a rebus.<ref name=\"Freud, S. 1900\">Freud, S. (1900) ''The Interpretation of Dreams.'' New York: Avon, 1980.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn [[psychology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic psychology]], certain [[hadith]]s indicate that [[dream]]s consist of three parts, and early [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] recognized three kinds of dreams: false, pathogenic, and true.<ref name=Amber-376>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}</ref> [[Ibn Sirin]] (654\u2013728) was renowned for his ''Ta'bir al-Ru'ya'' and ''Muntakhab al-Kalam fi Tabir al-Ahlam'', a book on dreams.

He writes that it is important for a layperson to seek assistance from an [['alim|alim]] (Muslim scholar) who could guide in the interpretation of dreams with a proper understanding of the cultural context and other such causes and interpretations.<ref name=Amber-375>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=375}}</ref> [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) (801\u2013873) also wrote a treatise on dream interpretation: ''On Sleep and Dreams''.<ref name=Amber-361>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=361}}</ref> In [[consciousness]] studies, [[Al-Farabi]] (872\u2013951) wrote the ''On the Cause of Dreams'', which appeared as chapter 24 of his ''Book of Opinions of the people of the Ideal City''.

Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah, trans.'', p. 338, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}</ref>\n\nIbn Shaheen states: \"Interpretations change their foundations according to the different conditions of the seer (of the vision), so seeing handcuffs during sleep is disliked but if a righteous person sees them it can mean stopping the hands from evil\". Ibn Sirin said about a man who saw himself giving a sermon from the mimbar: \"He will achieve authority and if he is not from the people who have any kind of authority it means that he will be crucified\".\n\n===China===\nA standard traditional Chinese book on dream-interpretation is the ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'' (\u5922\u5360\u9038\u65e8) compiled in the 16th century by Chen Shiyuan (particularly the \"Inner Chapters\" of that opus).<ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.1-4.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapters 1\u20134\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.5.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapter 5\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.6-9.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapters 6\u20139\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.10.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapter 10\"]</ref> Chinese thinkers also raised profound ideas about dream interpretation, such as the question of how we know we are dreaming and how we know we are awake. It is written in the Chuang-tzu: \"Once Chuang Chou dreamed that he was a butterfly. He fluttered about happily, quite pleased with the state that he was in, and knew nothing about Chuang Chou. Presently he awoke and found that he was very much Chuang Chou again. Now, did Chou dream that he was a butterfly or was the butterfly now dreaming that he was Chou?\" This raises the question of reality monitoring in dreams, a topic of intense interest in modern cognitive neuroscience.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M. | last2 = Kahan | first2 = T. | last3 = Raye | first3 = C. | year = 1984 | title = Dreams and reality monitoring | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 113 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013344 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.113.3.329}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blechner | first1 = M | year = 2005 | title = Elusive illusions: Reality judgment and reality assignment in dreams and waking life | url = | journal = Neuro-Psychoanalysis | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 95\u2013101 | doi=10.1080/15294145.2005.10773477}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Europe===\nIn the 17th century, the English physician and writer Sir [[Thomas Browne]] wrote a short tract upon the interpretation of dreams. Dream interpretation was taken up as part of [[psychoanalysis]] at the end of the 19th century; the perceived, ''manifest'' content of a dream is analyzed to reveal its ''latent'' meaning to the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the dreamer. One of the seminal works on the subject is ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' by [[Sigmund Freud]].\n\n=== The Present ===\nA paper<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Norton|first2=Michael I.|date=2009|title=When dreaming is believing: The (motivated) interpretation of dreams.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=96|issue=2|pages=249\u2013264|doi=10.1037/a0013264|pmid=19159131}}</ref> in 2009 by Carey Morewedge and Michael Norton in the ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' found that most people believe that \"their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths.\" In one study conducted in the United States, South Korea and India, they found that 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was endorsed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem solving, or random brain activity. This belief appears to lead people to attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study in the paper, Americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take.<sup>[11]</sup> Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.\n\n==Psychology==\n\n===Freud===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nIt was in his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''<ref name=\"Freud, S. 1900\"/> (''Die Traumdeutung''; literally \"dream-interpretation\"), first published in 1899 (but dated 1900), that [[Sigmund Freud]] first argued that the motivation of all dream content is [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillment]] (later in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud would discuss dreams which do not appear to be wish-fulfillment), and that the instigation of a dream is often to be found in the events of the day preceding the dream, which he called the \"day residue.\" In the case of very young children, Freud claimed, this can be easily seen, as small children dream quite straightforwardly of the fulfillment of wishes that were aroused in them the previous day (the \"dream day\"). In adults, however, the situation is more complicated\u2014since in Freud's submission, the dreams of adults have been subjected to distortion, with the dream's so-called \"[[Content (Freudian dream analysis)#Manifest content|manifest content]]\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Manifest content (pp. 52ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=xFtqAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-31767047-6 }}</ref> being a heavily disguised derivative of the \"[[Content (Freudian dream analysis)#Latent content|latent dream-thoughts]]\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Latent dream-content (pp. 31ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA31 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=1969 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-1-31767048-3 }}</ref> present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The interpretation of dreams|last=Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939.|date=2010|publisher=Basic Books A Member of the Perseus Books Group|others=Strachey, James.|isbn=9780465019779|location=New York|oclc=434126117}}</ref> As a result of this distortion and disguise, the dream's real significance is concealed: dreamers are no more capable of recognizing the actual meaning of their dreams than hysterics are able to understand the connection and significance of their neurotic symptoms.\n\nIn Freud's original formulation, the latent dream-thought was described as having been subject to an intra-psychic force referred to as \"the censor\"; in the more refined terminology of his later years, however, discussion was in terms of the [[super-ego]] and \"the work of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'s forces of defense.\" In waking life, he asserted, these so-called \"resistances\" altogether prevented the repressed wishes of the unconscious from entering consciousness; and though these wishes were to some extent able to emerge during the lowered state of sleep, the resistances were still strong enough to produce \"a veil of disguise\" sufficient to hide their true nature. Freud's view was that dreams are ''compromises'' which ensure that sleep is not interrupted: as \"a ''disguised'' fulfilment of ''repressed'' wishes,\" they succeed in representing wishes as fulfilled which might otherwise disturb and waken the dreamer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matalon | first1 = Nadav | year = 2011 | title = The Riddle Of Dreams | url = | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 517\u2013536 | doi=10.1080/09515089.2011.556605}}</ref>\n\nFreud's \"classic\" early dream analysis is that of \"[[Irma's injection]]\": in that dream, a former patient of Freud's complains of pains. The dream portrays Freud's colleague giving Irma an unsterile injection.  Freud provides us with pages of associations to the elements in his dream, using it to demonstrate his technique of decoding the latent dream thought from the manifest content of the dream.\n\nFreud described the actual technique of psychoanalytic dream-analysis in the following terms, suggesting that the true meaning of a dream must be \"weeded out\" from dream:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenio.com/214/remembering-and-understanding-your-dreams|title=Remembering and Understanding your Dreams|last=Wilson|first=Cynthia|date=3 April 2012|publisher=Womenio|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|You entirely disregard the apparent connections between the elements in the manifest dream and collect the ideas that occur to you in connection with each separate element of the dream by [[free association (psychology)|free association]] according to the psychoanalytic rule of procedure. From this material you arrive at the latent dream-thoughts, just as you arrived at the patient's hidden complexes from his associations to his symptoms and memories... The true meaning of the dream, which has now replaced the manifest content, is always clearly intelligible. [Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (1909); Lecture Three]}}\n\nFreud listed the distorting operations that he claimed were applied to repressed wishes in forming the dream as recollected: it is because of these distortions (the so-called \"dream-work\") that the manifest content of the dream differs so greatly from the latent dream thought reached through analysis\u2014and it is by ''reversing'' these distortions that the latent content is approached.\n\nThe operations included:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/freudlit/Dreams.html|title=Lecture Notes: Freud's Conception of the Psyche (Unconscious) and His Theory of Dreams|last=Gray|first=R.|date=9 January 2012|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Condensation (psychology)|Condensation]] \u2013 one dream object stands for several associations and ideas; thus \"dreams are brief, meagre and laconic in comparison with the range and wealth of the dream-thoughts.\"\n* [[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]] \u2013 a dream object's emotional significance is separated from its real object or content and attached to an entirely different one that does not raise the censor's suspicions.\n* Visualization \u2013 a thought is translated to visual images.\n* Symbolism \u2013 a symbol replaces an action, person, or idea.\n\nTo these might be added \"secondary elaboration\"\u2014the outcome of the dreamer's natural tendency to make some sort of \"sense\" or \"story\" out of the various elements of the manifest content as recollected. (Freud, in fact, was wont to stress that it was not merely futile but actually ''misleading'' to attempt to \"explain\" one part of the manifest content with reference to another part as if the manifest dream somehow constituted some unified or coherent conception).\n\nFreud considered that the experience of anxiety dreams and [[nightmares]] was the result of failures in the dream-work: rather than contradicting the \"wish-fulfillment\" theory, such phenomena demonstrated how the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] reacted to the awareness of repressed wishes that were too powerful and insufficiently disguised. Traumatic dreams (where the dream merely repeats the traumatic experience) were eventually admitted as exceptions to the theory.\n\nFreud famously described psychoanalytic dream-interpretation as \"the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind\"; he was, however, capable of expressing regret and dissatisfaction at the way his ideas on the subject were misrepresented or simply not understood:<ref>Freud, S. (1900) op.cit., (1919 edition), p. 397</ref>\n\n{{quote|The assertion that all dreams require a sexual interpretation, against which critics rage so incessantly, occurs nowhere in my ''Interpretation of Dreams'' ... and is in obvious contradiction to other views expressed in it. | Sigmund Freud | The Interpretation of Dreams}}\n\nOn another occasion, he suggested that the individual capable of recognizing the distinction between latent and manifest content \"will probably have gone further in understanding dreams than most readers of my ''Interpretation of Dreams''\".\n\n===Jung===\nAlthough not dismissing Freud's model of dream interpretation wholesale, [[Carl Jung]] believed Freud's notion of dreams as representations of unfulfilled wishes to be limited. Jung argued that Freud's procedure of collecting associations to a dream would bring insights into the dreamer's mental complex\u2014a person's associations to anything will reveal the mental complexes, as Jung had shown experimentally<ref>Jung, C.G. (1902) The associations of normal subjects. In: ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', vol. 2. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, pp. 3\u201399.</ref>\u2014but not necessarily closer to the meaning of the dream.<ref>Jacobi, J. (1973) ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</ref> Jung was convinced that the scope of dream interpretation was larger, reflecting the richness and complexity of the entire [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], both personal and [[collective unconscious|collective]]. Jung believed the psyche to be a self-regulating organism in which conscious attitudes were likely to be compensated for unconsciously (within the dream) by their opposites.<ref name=\"Anthony Storr 1983\">{{Cite book |author=Storr, Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Storr |title=The Essential Jung |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=0-691-02455-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/essentialjung00jung }}</ref> And so the role of dreams is to lead a person to wholeness through what Jung calls \"a dialogue between ego and the self\". The self aspires to tell the ego what it does not know, but it should. This dialogue involves fresh memories, existing obstacles, and future solutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/jungs-dream-theory-and-modern-neuroscience-from-fallacies-to-facts/|title=Jung's Dream Theory and Modern Neuroscience: From Fallacies to Facts|last=Lone|first=Zauraiz|date=2018-09-26|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\nJung proposed two basic approaches to analyzing dream material: the objective and the subjective.<ref>Jung, C.G. (1948) General aspects of dream psychology. In: ''Dreams.'' trans., R. Hull.  Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1974, pp. 23\u201366.</ref> In the objective approach, every person in the dream refers to the person they are: mother is mother, girlfriend is girlfriend, etc.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=What does it mean to be human?

John|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319949505|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=173|oclc=1050448349}}</ref> In the subjective approach, every person in the dream represents an aspect of the dreamer. Jung argued that the subjective approach is much more difficult for the dreamer to accept, but that in most good dream-work, the dreamer will come to recognize that the dream characters can represent an unacknowledged aspect of the dreamer. Thus, if the dreamer is being chased by a crazed killer, the dreamer may come eventually to recognize his own [[Homicide|homicidal]] impulses.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] therapists extended the subjective approach, claiming that even the inanimate objects in a dream can represent aspects of the dreamer.\n\nJung believed that [[archetypes]] such as the [[anima (Jung)|animus]], the [[anima (Jung)|anima]], the [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and others manifested themselves in dreams, as dream symbols or figures. Such figures could take the form of an old man, a young maiden or a giant spider as the case may be. Each represents an unconscious attitude that is largely hidden to the conscious mind. Although an integral part of the dreamer's psyche, these manifestations were largely autonomous and were perceived by the dreamer to be external personages. Acquaintance with the archetypes as manifested by these symbols serve to increase one's awareness of unconscious attitudes, integrating seemingly disparate parts of the psyche and contributing to the process of holistic self-understanding he considered paramount.<ref name=\"Anthony Storr 1983\"/>\n\nJung believed that material repressed by the conscious mind, postulated by Freud to comprise the unconscious, was similar to his own concept of the shadow, which in itself is only a small part of the unconscious.\n\nJung cautioned against blindly ascribing meaning to dream symbols without a clear understanding of the client's personal situation. He described two approaches to dream symbols: the causal approach and the final approach.<ref>Jung, C.G. (1948) op.cit.</ref> In the causal approach, the symbol is reduced to certain fundamental tendencies. Thus, a sword may symbolize a penis, as may a snake. In the final approach, the dream interpreter asks, \"Why this symbol and not another?\" Thus, a sword representing a penis is hard, sharp, inanimate, and destructive. A snake representing a penis is alive, dangerous, perhaps poisonous and slimy. The final approach will tell additional things about the dreamer's attitudes.\n\nTechnically, Jung recommended stripping the dream of its details and presenting the gist of the dream to the dreamer. This was an adaptation of a procedure described by [[Wilhelm Stekel]], who recommended thinking of the dream as a newspaper article and writing a headline for it.<ref>Stekel, W. (1911) ''Die Sprache des Traumes'' (The Language of the Dream). Wiesbaden: J.F. Berman</ref> [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] also described a similar process of \"dream distillation.\"<ref>Sullivan, H.S. (1953) ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry.'' New York: Norton.</ref>\n\nAlthough Jung acknowledged the universality of archetypal symbols, he contrasted this with the concept of a sign\u2014images having a one-to-one connotation with their meaning. His approach was to recognize the dynamism and fluidity that existed between symbols and their ascribed meaning. Symbols must be explored for their personal significance to the patient, instead of having the dream conform to some predetermined idea. This prevents dream analysis from devolving into a theoretical and dogmatic exercise that is far removed from the patient's own psychological state. In the service of this idea, he stressed the importance of \"sticking to the image\"\u2014exploring in depth a client's association with a particular image. This may be contrasted with Freud's free associating which he believed was a deviation from the salience of the image. He describes for example the image \"deal table.\" One would expect the dreamer to have some associations with this image, and the professed lack of any perceived significance or familiarity whatsoever should make one suspicious. Jung would ask a patient to imagine the image as vividly as possible and to explain it to him as if he had no idea as to what a \"deal table\" was. Jung stressed the importance of context in dream analysis.\n\nJung stressed that the dream was not merely a devious puzzle invented by the unconscious to be deciphered, so that the ''true'' causal factors behind it may be elicited. Dreams were not to serve as lie detectors, with which to reveal the insincerity behind conscious thought processes. Dreams, like the unconscious, had their own language. As representations of the unconscious, dream images have their own primacy and mechanics.\n\nJung believed that dreams may contain ineluctable truths, philosophical pronouncements, illusions, wild fantasies, memories, plans, irrational experiences and even [[Telepathy|telepathic]] visions.<ref>{{Cite book|author= Jung, Carl |authorlink=Carl Jung |title=The Practice of Psychotherapy. The Practical Use of Dream-analysis |year=1934 |page=147 |isbn=0-7100-1645-X}}</ref> Just as the psyche has a diurnal side which we experience as conscious life, it has an unconscious nocturnal side which we apprehend as dreamlike fantasy. Jung would argue that just as we do not doubt the importance of our conscious experience, then we ought not to second guess the value of our unconscious lives.\n\n===Hall===\nIn 1953, [[Calvin S. Hall]] developed a theory of dreams in which dreaming is considered to be a [[cognitive]] process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/Library/hall_1953b.html |author=Calvin S. Hall |title=A Cognitive Theory of Dreams |publisher=dreamresearch.net |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Hall argued that a dream was simply a thought or sequence of thoughts that occurred during sleep, and that dream images are visual representations of personal conceptions. For example, if one dreams of being attacked by friends, this may be a manifestation of fear of friendship; a more complicated example, which requires a cultural metaphor, is that a cat within a dream symbolizes a need to use one's intuition. For [[English language|English]] speakers, it may suggest that the dreamer must recognize that there is \"more than one way to skin a cat,\" or in other words, more than one way to do something.\n\n===Faraday, Clift, et al.===\nIn the 1970s, [[Ann Faraday]] and others helped bring dream interpretation into the mainstream by publishing books on do-it-yourself dream interpretation and forming groups to share and analyze dreams. Faraday focused on the application of dreams to situations occurring in one's life. For instance, some dreams are warnings of something about to happen\u2014e.g. a dream of failing an examination, if one is a student, may be a literal warning of unpreparedness. Outside of such context, it could relate to failing some other kind of test. Or it could even have a \"[[pun]]ny\" nature, e.g. that one has failed to examine some aspect of his life adequately.\n\nFaraday noted that \"one finding has emerged pretty firmly from modern research, namely that the majority of dreams seem in some way to reflect things that have preoccupied our minds during the previous day or two.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dream Game |author=Faraday, Ann |page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, [[Wallace Clift]] and [[Jean Dalby Clift]] further explored the relationship between images produced in dreams and the dreamer's waking life. Their books identified patterns in dreaming, and ways of analyzing dreams to explore life changes, with particular emphasis on moving toward healing and wholeness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |last2=Clift |first2=Wallace |year=1984 |title=Symbols of Transformation in Dreams |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-0653-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/symbolsoftransfo00clif }}; {{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |last2=Clift |first2=Wallace |year=1988 |title=The Hero Journey in Dreams |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-0889-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/herojourneyindre0000clif }}; {{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |year=1992 |title=Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-1218-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/coreimagesofself0000clif }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dream dictionary]]\n* [[Dream journal]]\n* [[Dream sharing]]\n* [[Lucid dreaming]]\n* [[Oneiromancy]], a form of divination\n* [[Oneironautics]]\n* [[Personality test]]\n* [[Psychoanalytic dream interpretation]]\n* [[Recurring dream]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Some of these may have been used as sources to support article content.

In modern times, various schools of [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]] have offered theories about the meaning and purpose of dreams. Most people currently appear to interpret dream content according to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|Freudian theory]] of dreams in countries, as found by a study conducted in the [[United States]], [[India]], and [[South Korea]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople appear to believe dreams are particularly meaningful: they assign more meaning to dreams than to similar waking thoughts. For example, people report they would be more likely to cancel a trip they had planned that involved a plane flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before than if the Department of Homeland Security issued a Federal warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, people do not attribute equal importance to all dreams.

[[Hieroglyph]]ics depicting dreams and their interpretations are evident. Dreams have been held in considerable importance through history by most cultures.\n\n===Classical Antiquity===\nThe [[ancient Greeks]] constructed temples they called [[Asclepieion]]s, where sick people were sent to be cured. It was believed that cures would be effected through [[divine grace]] by [[incubation (ritual)|incubating dreams]] within the confines of the temple. Dreams were also considered prophetic or [[omen]]s of particular significance. [[Artemidorus]] of Daldis, who lived in the 2nd century AD, wrote a comprehensive text ''Oneirocritica (The Interpretation of Dreams)''.<ref>Artemidorus (1990) The Interpretation of Dreams: Oneirocritica. White, R., trans., Torrance, CA: Original Books, 2nd Edition.</ref> Although Artemidorus believed that dreams can predict the future, he presaged many contemporary approaches to dreams. He thought that the meaning of a dream image could involve puns and could be understood by decoding the image into its component words. For example, Alexander, while waging war against the Tyrians, dreamt that a satyr was dancing on his shield. Artemidorus reports that this dream was interpreted as follows: satyr = ''sa tyros'' (\"Tyre will be thine\"), predicting that Alexander would be triumphant. Freud acknowledged this example of Artemidorus when he proposed that dreams be interpreted like a rebus.<ref name=\"Freud, S. 1900\">Freud, S. (1900) ''The Interpretation of Dreams.'' New York: Avon, 1980.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn [[psychology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic psychology]], certain [[hadith]]s indicate that [[dream]]s consist of three parts, and early [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] recognized three kinds of dreams: false, pathogenic, and true.<ref name=Amber-376>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}</ref> [[Ibn Sirin]] (654\u2013728) was renowned for his ''Ta'bir al-Ru'ya'' and ''Muntakhab al-Kalam fi Tabir al-Ahlam'', a book on dreams. The work is divided into 25 sections on dream interpretation, from the etiquette of interpreting dreams to the interpretation of reciting certain [[Sura]]hs of the [[Qur'an]] in one's dream. He writes that it is important for a layperson to seek assistance from an [['alim|alim]] (Muslim scholar) who could guide in the interpretation of dreams with a proper understanding of the cultural context and other such causes and interpretations.<ref name=Amber-375>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=375}}</ref> [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) (801\u2013873) also wrote a treatise on dream interpretation: ''On Sleep and Dreams''.<ref name=Amber-361>{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=361}}</ref> In [[consciousness]] studies, [[Al-Farabi]] (872\u2013951) wrote the ''On the Cause of Dreams'', which appeared as chapter 24 of his ''Book of Opinions of the people of the Ideal City''.

Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah, trans.'', p. 338, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}</ref>\n\nIbn Shaheen states: \"Interpretations change their foundations according to the different conditions of the seer (of the vision), so seeing handcuffs during sleep is disliked but if a righteous person sees them it can mean stopping the hands from evil\". Ibn Sirin said about a man who saw himself giving a sermon from the mimbar: \"He will achieve authority and if he is not from the people who have any kind of authority it means that he will be crucified\".\n\n===China===\nA standard traditional Chinese book on dream-interpretation is the ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'' (\u5922\u5360\u9038\u65e8) compiled in the 16th century by Chen Shiyuan (particularly the \"Inner Chapters\" of that opus).<ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.1-4.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapters 1\u20134\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.5.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapter 5\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.6-9.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapters 6\u20139\"]</ref><ref>[http://dreams.00.gs/Wandering_Spirits,_I.10.htm ''Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation'', \"Inner Chapter 10\"]</ref> Chinese thinkers also raised profound ideas about dream interpretation, such as the question of how we know we are dreaming and how we know we are awake. It is written in the Chuang-tzu: \"Once Chuang Chou dreamed that he was a butterfly. He fluttered about happily, quite pleased with the state that he was in, and knew nothing about Chuang Chou. Presently he awoke and found that he was very much Chuang Chou again. Now, did Chou dream that he was a butterfly or was the butterfly now dreaming that he was Chou?\" This raises the question of reality monitoring in dreams, a topic of intense interest in modern cognitive neuroscience.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M. | last2 = Kahan | first2 = T. | last3 = Raye | first3 = C. | year = 1984 | title = Dreams and reality monitoring | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 113 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013344 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.113.3.329}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blechner | first1 = M | year = 2005 | title = Elusive illusions: Reality judgment and reality assignment in dreams and waking life | url = | journal = Neuro-Psychoanalysis | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 95\u2013101 | doi=10.1080/15294145.2005.10773477}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Europe===\nIn the 17th century, the English physician and writer Sir [[Thomas Browne]] wrote a short tract upon the interpretation of dreams. Dream interpretation was taken up as part of [[psychoanalysis]] at the end of the 19th century; the perceived, ''manifest'' content of a dream is analyzed to reveal its ''latent'' meaning to the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the dreamer. One of the seminal works on the subject is ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' by [[Sigmund Freud]].\n\n=== The Present ===\nA paper<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Norton|first2=Michael I.|date=2009|title=When dreaming is believing: The (motivated) interpretation of dreams.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=96|issue=2|pages=249\u2013264|doi=10.1037/a0013264|pmid=19159131}}</ref> in 2009 by Carey Morewedge and Michael Norton in the ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' found that most people believe that \"their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths.\" In one study conducted in the United States, South Korea and India, they found that 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was endorsed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem solving, or random brain activity. This belief appears to lead people to attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study in the paper, Americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take.<sup>[11]</sup> Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.\n\n==Psychology==\n\n===Freud===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nIt was in his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''<ref name=\"Freud, S. 1900\"/> (''Die Traumdeutung''; literally \"dream-interpretation\"), first published in 1899 (but dated 1900), that [[Sigmund Freud]] first argued that the motivation of all dream content is [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillment]] (later in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud would discuss dreams which do not appear to be wish-fulfillment), and that the instigation of a dream is often to be found in the events of the day preceding the dream, which he called the \"day residue.\" In the case of very young children, Freud claimed, this can be easily seen, as small children dream quite straightforwardly of the fulfillment of wishes that were aroused in them the previous day (the \"dream day\"). In adults, however, the situation is more complicated\u2014since in Freud's submission, the dreams of adults have been subjected to distortion, with the dream's so-called \"[[Content (Freudian dream analysis)#Manifest content|manifest content]]\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Manifest content (pp. 52ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=xFtqAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-31767047-6 }}</ref> being a heavily disguised derivative of the \"[[Content (Freudian dream analysis)#Latent content|latent dream-thoughts]]\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Latent dream-content (pp. 31ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA31 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=1969 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-1-31767048-3 }}</ref> present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The interpretation of dreams|last=Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939.|date=2010|publisher=Basic Books A Member of the Perseus Books Group|others=Strachey, James.|isbn=9780465019779|location=New York|oclc=434126117}}</ref> As a result of this distortion and disguise, the dream's real significance is concealed: dreamers are no more capable of recognizing the actual meaning of their dreams than hysterics are able to understand the connection and significance of their neurotic symptoms.\n\nIn Freud's original formulation, the latent dream-thought was described as having been subject to an intra-psychic force referred to as \"the censor\"; in the more refined terminology of his later years, however, discussion was in terms of the [[super-ego]] and \"the work of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'s forces of defense.\" In waking life, he asserted, these so-called \"resistances\" altogether prevented the repressed wishes of the unconscious from entering consciousness; and though these wishes were to some extent able to emerge during the lowered state of sleep, the resistances were still strong enough to produce \"a veil of disguise\" sufficient to hide their true nature. Freud's view was that dreams are ''compromises'' which ensure that sleep is not interrupted: as \"a ''disguised'' fulfilment of ''repressed'' wishes,\" they succeed in representing wishes as fulfilled which might otherwise disturb and waken the dreamer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matalon | first1 = Nadav | year = 2011 | title = The Riddle Of Dreams | url = | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 517\u2013536 | doi=10.1080/09515089.2011.556605}}</ref>\n\nFreud's \"classic\" early dream analysis is that of \"[[Irma's injection]]\": in that dream, a former patient of Freud's complains of pains. The dream portrays Freud's colleague giving Irma an unsterile injection.  Freud provides us with pages of associations to the elements in his dream, using it to demonstrate his technique of decoding the latent dream thought from the manifest content of the dream.\n\nFreud described the actual technique of psychoanalytic dream-analysis in the following terms, suggesting that the true meaning of a dream must be \"weeded out\" from dream:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenio.com/214/remembering-and-understanding-your-dreams|title=Remembering and Understanding your Dreams|last=Wilson|first=Cynthia|date=3 April 2012|publisher=Womenio|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|You entirely disregard the apparent connections between the elements in the manifest dream and collect the ideas that occur to you in connection with each separate element of the dream by [[free association (psychology)|free association]] according to the psychoanalytic rule of procedure. From this material you arrive at the latent dream-thoughts, just as you arrived at the patient's hidden complexes from his associations to his symptoms and memories... The true meaning of the dream, which has now replaced the manifest content, is always clearly intelligible. [Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (1909); Lecture Three]}}\n\nFreud listed the distorting operations that he claimed were applied to repressed wishes in forming the dream as recollected: it is because of these distortions (the so-called \"dream-work\") that the manifest content of the dream differs so greatly from the latent dream thought reached through analysis\u2014and it is by ''reversing'' these distortions that the latent content is approached.\n\nThe operations included:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/freudlit/Dreams.html|title=Lecture Notes: Freud's Conception of the Psyche (Unconscious) and His Theory of Dreams|last=Gray|first=R.|date=9 January 2012|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Condensation (psychology)|Condensation]] \u2013 one dream object stands for several associations and ideas; thus \"dreams are brief, meagre and laconic in comparison with the range and wealth of the dream-thoughts.\"\n* [[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]] \u2013 a dream object's emotional significance is separated from its real object or content and attached to an entirely different one that does not raise the censor's suspicions.\n* Visualization \u2013 a thought is translated to visual images.\n* Symbolism \u2013 a symbol replaces an action, person, or idea.\n\nTo these might be added \"secondary elaboration\"\u2014the outcome of the dreamer's natural tendency to make some sort of \"sense\" or \"story\" out of the various elements of the manifest content as recollected. (Freud, in fact, was wont to stress that it was not merely futile but actually ''misleading'' to attempt to \"explain\" one part of the manifest content with reference to another part as if the manifest dream somehow constituted some unified or coherent conception).\n\nFreud considered that the experience of anxiety dreams and [[nightmares]] was the result of failures in the dream-work: rather than contradicting the \"wish-fulfillment\" theory, such phenomena demonstrated how the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] reacted to the awareness of repressed wishes that were too powerful and insufficiently disguised. Traumatic dreams (where the dream merely repeats the traumatic experience) were eventually admitted as exceptions to the theory.\n\nFreud famously described psychoanalytic dream-interpretation as \"the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind\"; he was, however, capable of expressing regret and dissatisfaction at the way his ideas on the subject were misrepresented or simply not understood:<ref>Freud, S. (1900) op.cit., (1919 edition), p. 397</ref>\n\n{{quote|The assertion that all dreams require a sexual interpretation, against which critics rage so incessantly, occurs nowhere in my ''Interpretation of Dreams'' ... and is in obvious contradiction to other views expressed in it. | Sigmund Freud | The Interpretation of Dreams}}\n\nOn another occasion, he suggested that the individual capable of recognizing the distinction between latent and manifest content \"will probably have gone further in understanding dreams than most readers of my ''Interpretation of Dreams''\".\n\n===Jung===\nAlthough not dismissing Freud's model of dream interpretation wholesale, [[Carl Jung]] believed Freud's notion of dreams as representations of unfulfilled wishes to be limited. Jung argued that Freud's procedure of collecting associations to a dream would bring insights into the dreamer's mental complex\u2014a person's associations to anything will reveal the mental complexes, as Jung had shown experimentally<ref>Jung, C.G. (1902) The associations of normal subjects. In: ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', vol. 2. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, pp. 3\u201399.</ref>\u2014but not necessarily closer to the meaning of the dream.<ref>Jacobi, J. (1973) ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</ref> Jung was convinced that the scope of dream interpretation was larger, reflecting the richness and complexity of the entire [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], both personal and [[collective unconscious|collective]]. Jung believed the psyche to be a self-regulating organism in which conscious attitudes were likely to be compensated for unconsciously (within the dream) by their opposites.<ref name=\"Anthony Storr 1983\">{{Cite book |author=Storr, Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Storr |title=The Essential Jung |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=0-691-02455-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/essentialjung00jung }}</ref> And so the role of dreams is to lead a person to wholeness through what Jung calls \"a dialogue between ego and the self\". The self aspires to tell the ego what it does not know, but it should. This dialogue involves fresh memories, existing obstacles, and future solutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/jungs-dream-theory-and-modern-neuroscience-from-fallacies-to-facts/|title=Jung's Dream Theory and Modern Neuroscience: From Fallacies to Facts|last=Lone|first=Zauraiz|date=2018-09-26|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\nJung proposed two basic approaches to analyzing dream material: the objective and the subjective.<ref>Jung, C.G. (1948) General aspects of dream psychology. In: ''Dreams.'' trans., R. Hull.  Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1974, pp. 23\u201366.</ref> In the objective approach, every person in the dream refers to the person they are: mother is mother, girlfriend is girlfriend, etc.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=What does it mean to be human? Life, Death, Personhood and the Transhumanist Movement|last=Doyle|first=D. John|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319949505|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=173|oclc=1050448349}}</ref> In the subjective approach, every person in the dream represents an aspect of the dreamer. Jung argued that the subjective approach is much more difficult for the dreamer to accept, but that in most good dream-work, the dreamer will come to recognize that the dream characters can represent an unacknowledged aspect of the dreamer. Thus, if the dreamer is being chased by a crazed killer, the dreamer may come eventually to recognize his own [[Homicide|homicidal]] impulses.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] therapists extended the subjective approach, claiming that even the inanimate objects in a dream can represent aspects of the dreamer.\n\nJung believed that [[archetypes]] such as the [[anima (Jung)|animus]], the [[anima (Jung)|anima]], the [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and others manifested themselves in dreams, as dream symbols or figures. Such figures could take the form of an old man, a young maiden or a giant spider as the case may be. Each represents an unconscious attitude that is largely hidden to the conscious mind. Although an integral part of the dreamer's psyche, these manifestations were largely autonomous and were perceived by the dreamer to be external personages. Acquaintance with the archetypes as manifested by these symbols serve to increase one's awareness of unconscious attitudes, integrating seemingly disparate parts of the psyche and contributing to the process of holistic self-understanding he considered paramount.<ref name=\"Anthony Storr 1983\"/>\n\nJung believed that material repressed by the conscious mind, postulated by Freud to comprise the unconscious, was similar to his own concept of the shadow, which in itself is only a small part of the unconscious.\n\nJung cautioned against blindly ascribing meaning to dream symbols without a clear understanding of the client's personal situation. He described two approaches to dream symbols: the causal approach and the final approach.<ref>Jung, C.G. (1948) op.cit.</ref> In the causal approach, the symbol is reduced to certain fundamental tendencies. Thus, a sword may symbolize a penis, as may a snake. In the final approach, the dream interpreter asks, \"Why this symbol and not another?\" Thus, a sword representing a penis is hard, sharp, inanimate, and destructive. A snake representing a penis is alive, dangerous, perhaps poisonous and slimy. The final approach will tell additional things about the dreamer's attitudes.\n\nTechnically, Jung recommended stripping the dream of its details and presenting the gist of the dream to the dreamer. This was an adaptation of a procedure described by [[Wilhelm Stekel]], who recommended thinking of the dream as a newspaper article and writing a headline for it.<ref>Stekel, W. (1911) ''Die Sprache des Traumes'' (The Language of the Dream). Wiesbaden: J.F. Berman</ref> [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] also described a similar process of \"dream distillation.\"<ref>Sullivan, H.S. (1953) ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry.'' New York: Norton.</ref>\n\nAlthough Jung acknowledged the universality of archetypal symbols, he contrasted this with the concept of a sign\u2014images having a one-to-one connotation with their meaning. His approach was to recognize the dynamism and fluidity that existed between symbols and their ascribed meaning. Symbols must be explored for their personal significance to the patient, instead of having the dream conform to some predetermined idea. This prevents dream analysis from devolving into a theoretical and dogmatic exercise that is far removed from the patient's own psychological state. In the service of this idea, he stressed the importance of \"sticking to the image\"\u2014exploring in depth a client's association with a particular image. This may be contrasted with Freud's free associating which he believed was a deviation from the salience of the image. He describes for example the image \"deal table.\" One would expect the dreamer to have some associations with this image, and the professed lack of any perceived significance or familiarity whatsoever should make one suspicious. Jung would ask a patient to imagine the image as vividly as possible and to explain it to him as if he had no idea as to what a \"deal table\" was. Jung stressed the importance of context in dream analysis.\n\nJung stressed that the dream was not merely a devious puzzle invented by the unconscious to be deciphered, so that the ''true'' causal factors behind it may be elicited. Dreams were not to serve as lie detectors, with which to reveal the insincerity behind conscious thought processes. Dreams, like the unconscious, had their own language. As representations of the unconscious, dream images have their own primacy and mechanics.\n\nJung believed that dreams may contain ineluctable truths, philosophical pronouncements, illusions, wild fantasies, memories, plans, irrational experiences and even [[Telepathy|telepathic]] visions.<ref>{{Cite book|author= Jung, Carl |authorlink=Carl Jung |title=The Practice of Psychotherapy. The Practical Use of Dream-analysis |year=1934 |page=147 |isbn=0-7100-1645-X}}</ref> Just as the psyche has a diurnal side which we experience as conscious life, it has an unconscious nocturnal side which we apprehend as dreamlike fantasy. Jung would argue that just as we do not doubt the importance of our conscious experience, then we ought not to second guess the value of our unconscious lives.\n\n===Hall===\nIn 1953, [[Calvin S. Hall]] developed a theory of dreams in which dreaming is considered to be a [[cognitive]] process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/Library/hall_1953b.html |author=Calvin S. Hall |title=A Cognitive Theory of Dreams |publisher=dreamresearch.net |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Hall argued that a dream was simply a thought or sequence of thoughts that occurred during sleep, and that dream images are visual representations of personal conceptions. For example, if one dreams of being attacked by friends, this may be a manifestation of fear of friendship; a more complicated example, which requires a cultural metaphor, is that a cat within a dream symbolizes a need to use one's intuition. For [[English language|English]] speakers, it may suggest that the dreamer must recognize that there is \"more than one way to skin a cat,\" or in other words, more than one way to do something.\n\n===Faraday, Clift, et al.===\nIn the 1970s, [[Ann Faraday]] and others helped bring dream interpretation into the mainstream by publishing books on do-it-yourself dream interpretation and forming groups to share and analyze dreams. Faraday focused on the application of dreams to situations occurring in one's life. For instance, some dreams are warnings of something about to happen\u2014e.g. a dream of failing an examination, if one is a student, may be a literal warning of unpreparedness. Outside of such context, it could relate to failing some other kind of test. Or it could even have a \"[[pun]]ny\" nature, e.g. that one has failed to examine some aspect of his life adequately.\n\nFaraday noted that \"one finding has emerged pretty firmly from modern research, namely that the majority of dreams seem in some way to reflect things that have preoccupied our minds during the previous day or two.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dream Game |author=Faraday, Ann |page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, [[Wallace Clift]] and [[Jean Dalby Clift]] further explored the relationship between images produced in dreams and the dreamer's waking life. Their books identified patterns in dreaming, and ways of analyzing dreams to explore life changes, with particular emphasis on moving toward healing and wholeness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |last2=Clift |first2=Wallace |year=1984 |title=Symbols of Transformation in Dreams |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-0653-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/symbolsoftransfo00clif }}; {{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |last2=Clift |first2=Wallace |year=1988 |title=The Hero Journey in Dreams |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-0889-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/herojourneyindre0000clif }}; {{Cite book |last=Clift |first=Jean Dalby |year=1992 |title=Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |isbn=0-8245-1218-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/coreimagesofself0000clif }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dream dictionary]]\n* [[Dream journal]]\n* [[Dream sharing]]\n* [[Lucid dreaming]]\n* [[Oneiromancy]], a form of divination\n* [[Oneironautics]]\n* [[Personality test]]\n* [[Psychoanalytic dream interpretation]]\n* [[Recurring dream]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Some of these may have been used as sources to support article content.

Amy gets knocked off her horse while trying to take Ben's horse across the river on a trail ride and sustains an injury. Ty is offered a job at Briar Ridge and has accepted. When Amy hears that Ty might take the job, she snaps at him. Ty is eventually fired when Val discovers stuff from his past. \n |LineColor       = 8888FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = The Best Laid Plans\n |DirectedBy      = Steve DiMarco\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Conkie\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|12|2}}\n |ProdCode        = 163758-5\n |ShortSummary    = Lou upsets her friends and family as she arranges to have a video made to promote Heartland and micromanages its filming.

Once they return to the ranch, it becomes evident something is wrong, which Ty correctly guesses to be pesticide poisoning. Ty looks into Marion's notebooks, and gets Mallory's help to mix charcoal and water. Caleb and his friend Kit, who Ty met accidentally while she was bathing in the pond early that morning, show up. Ty explains the situation, and they get Spartan to drink all the jugs of charcoal water together. Meanwhile, Lou's friends work out their problems with each other, themselves, and their love lives. Lou's friend Lauren kisses Tim, who pushes her away, and Lou becomes upset with her friend. Lou admits Scott said no to her proposal because he wasn't sure, and that she doesn't know how they stand now. At the end of the trip, Lou feels bad for the fight that happened among the girls the previous night and tries to apologize, but the girls say it was therapeutic, and they will be sure to spread the word in New York about the Heartland Equestrian Connection.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Holding Fast\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Southam\n |WrittenBy       = [[Susin Nielsen]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|11|9}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-5\n |ShortSummary    = Out for a ride along the river, Amy comes across an RCMP officer trying to save a young boy from drowning.

Lou goes to a polo match for Nick Harwell's polo team, as he gave her a number of free tickets, and upsets Scott when Nick talks about hiring him and Lou praises his work. Scott and Lou talk about the state of their relationship, and they break up for real. Lisa tries to convince Jack to go to the polo match with her, but he refuses.  Jack shows up just as the match starts and apologizes to Lisa for being so stubborn. Ashley takes Caleb to the polo club with her and shares her new pursuit of barrel racing (which Kit is teaching her) with her mother's friends, much to Val's chagrin. Ty asks Amy out on a date, but she already has plans with Caleb. Mallory tries to get rid of Jake, using lame excuses to avoid seeing him and ignoring his phone calls. Jack facilitates an honest conversation between the two, frustrated with their beating around the bush and hoping to get some peace.

Amy seems concerned over Ty and Kit's budding friendship. Ashley is noticeably upset at the party that follows the rodeo and is drinking quite heavily, and Amy learns from her that Apollo, Ashley's show jumping horse and the only horse that she had a bond with, has been sold. By the end of the night, Ashley is too intoxicated to take herself home, so Amy drives. She takes her eyes off the road and swerves, then Ashley yanks the wheel and they go off the road. Ty and Kit are headed home in his truck, and they help the girls. The next morning, Ty takes the blame for the accident, as Ashley was drunk and Amy doesn't have her drivers license.

While most of the family are awake because of the heat, Brad Borden (Ty's father) comes to Heartland with six horses in a livestock trailer designed for cattle. One of the horses is down on the floor with a bad head wound, and Jack is forced to do the merciful thing, though Amy is desperate to prevent it. The other five horses are badly dehydrated and in rough shape, but able to wait until morning, when Scott can get to Heartland from Red Deer. Amy has a feeling that she knows one of the horses, and after cleaning his face, realizes that it is Ashley's former jumper, Apollo. When Amy calls Ashley, she is distraught thinking that her mother sold Apollo to a meat truck. In fairness, Val thought that the horse dealer she sold to was reputable. Ashley smashes the windows of Val's SUV with a golf club and runs away from home, despite Val's threats to cut her off financially. Ashley spends much of the episode working and living at the dude ranch, and considering dropping out of high school. Ty is upset with his father for leaving him alone in Calgary, resulting in some bad things for Ty. Amy, Ty, Caleb, and Mallory work together to  care for the horses which ends in a water fight. When the rain finally comes and cools off the heat, Ty and Amy go outside and kiss, but Ty breaks it off, worrying he is like his dad and saying he doesn't want to hurt Amy. Once the horses are cared for, Lou deals with the logistics by making a deal with their owner (a horse dealer) to buy the five healthy horses for $2000.  However, Brad takes the money and leaves abruptly in the middle of the night, after receiving a call from the men that are still expecting his to return their money. Constable Rodriguez comes to the rescue when it looks like the horses will have to go back to the dealer, and the family keep the horses to use on trail rides for the dude ranch.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Showdown!\n |DirectedBy      = [[Sudz Sutherland]]\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|12|7}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-8\n |ShortSummary    = Amy and Soraya return to school, and Amy makes a bunch of schedules so that Caleb and Ty will do most of the work, and she won't have to fall behind in her studies this year. However, there have been some mysterious [[cattle raiding|cattle rustlers]] roaming about stealing many ranchers' cows and the ranchers are getting worried. Tim is one such rancher, and he hires both Caleb and Ty to watch his herd. This angers Amy, as she knows they won't have enough time to do most of the regular chores at the ranch as well. When she expresses this anger to Caleb, he kisses her and tells her that she thinks too much. The next day, Ty and Kit are having fun while working on schoolwork in the back of his truck, and they kiss. By this time, they had become close, and she had helped Ty apply to take online courses to complete his high-school diploma. Mallory discovered at the start of the episode that her parents had important news that could only be shared face-to-face. Her father has a gold record, and is going on tour to promote it. Since they can't be around to take care of her, Mallory is to be sent to Blessed Virgin Academy, an all-girls boarding school. There is a touching moment as she leaves the ranch. The tension continues to increase in this episode, as the ranchers become more and more concerned about their cattle. The police try to help track the rustlers, but they work swiftly, observing herds from a helicopter, then cutting fence lines and rounding up the cattle, driving them into a livestock trailer and escaping. Lou feels torn, as she has started seeing Mark Rodriguez, to whom her father is becoming increasingly hostile, feeling that the constable is inept at his job of preventing livestock theft. The episode reaches its climax when Ty and Caleb watch as the cattle rustlers turn up to steal Tim's herd of cattle. Amy rides off in search of the ranch hands when she finds no work completed in the barn, and comes across the same scene, but one of the rustlers causes Spartan to rear, dropping Amy to the ground. Ty and Caleb come to help her, and she manages to escape, but the rustler has a gun and they stop advancing towards the scene of the crime. Jack drives up with Tim in tow, tipped off by Ashley, and try to stop the rustlers, but they are outnumbered. Amy sees this, and comes running towards them, calling, \"Dad!\" The rustlers turn, guns in hand, and shoot towards her; Tim takes a bullet to protect Amy. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with no indication of where the bullet got Tim or whether he will survive, and the cattle rustlers drive off with his entire herd (minus the two longhorns).\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = True Enough\n |DirectedBy      = Sudz Sutherland\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Conkie\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-9\n |ShortSummary    = The episode prolongs the cliffhanger as long as possible, not referring to what happened to Tim, showing an influx of food from friends of the family (which usually corresponds with a funeral) and a conversation between Lou and Jack about Amy, saying that it's good she went on a ride. She is even seen riding past the cemetery where her mom was buried in the first episode. Tim turns out to have been injured in his right shoulder, and he is wearing a sling. Tim becomes a source of tension in the household, constantly ringing a bell and expecting to be served. Amy is feeling guilty for being the cause of his bullet wound (although indirectly), and she heals while caring for another horse. Amy's teacher, Ruth Adams, is trying to sell her father's old chestnut, Boxer. Amy and Ty try to help him settle in while they work on rehoming him, by bringing Hank Adams to visit his horse. While he is there, Ruth shows up, very upset that her father was brought to the ranch, revealing that Hank has Alzheimer's. Despite being fuzzy about who his daughter is, Hank clearly remembers Boxer and even Jack. Jack eventually remembers that Hank was the lead guitarist for his wife, Lyndy, when she was a singer professionally. Jack had brought out an old record of hers to listen to, and they listen to it while talking with the Adams. Hank spontaneously picks up a guitar and starts playing the song in time with the record. In the end, Amy offers to keep Boxer so that Hank can visit him while he is able, and Ruth accepts this offer. While Tim is wearing out his welcome with Jack, Callie Phillips shows up and starts taking care of Tim. It seems they have been seeing each other since the cattle drive earlier in the season, and she stays at Big River whenever she is in town. This is quite a shock to the girls, who had no idea that Tim had a girlfriend. Amy is the least comfortable with it, and is fairly rude to Callie while she stays with them overnight. In the meantime, Lou is still seeing Mark, and enjoying it, even making him a mixed CD of police-related songs (whether by theme or artists' name). However, they were supposed to take a trip to the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and have lunch there, but Mark says he is busy going to a provincial review meeting in Edmonton. This turns out to be a lie when Lou sees him kissing a blonde in Hudson, in his truck. He tries to explain that he didn't think they were exclusive, but Lou dumps him without a second thought. Ty is on a date with Kit, and Caleb tells Amy that Ty gave her up too easily. Caleb then shares a kiss with an enthusiastic Amy. Callie and Tim get in a fight, but get back together, and she takes him back to Big River, and finally out of Jack's hair.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n |Title           = Starstruck!\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-10\n |ShortSummary    = Hollywood starlet and gossip-rag fodder Mindy Fanshaw arrives at Heartland under the pretext of honing her riding skills, which turn out to be non-existent. Mallory is found hiding in one of the dude ranch cabins, having been aided in her 'escape' from the boarding school by Jake. Mallory collects items Mindy has used around Heartland, planning to sell them on eBay so she can repay Jake for the money he spent helping her. Mindy digs into the Ty/Amy/Caleb 'triangle', lying to all three about what the others had said and attempts to pit the three against each other. She attacks Amy in particular for being unable to choose between Ty and Caleb or express how she feels about either guy. When Mindy ropes Caleb into taking her on a trail ride, she insists on riding an ailing Pegasus, ignoring Amy's warning that the horse should not be used. This results in a calculated photo-op for Mindy with paparazzi tipped off by her agent. The photographers get too close and spook Pegasus, dropping Mindy off his back, but causing stone bruises and a chipped bone for Pegasus. Lou eventually kicks Mindy out for behaving as a spoiled rich girl and disrupting the peace at Heartland, and she drives off into the sunset. She does leave Amy a parting gift, in the form of a very flashy, one of a kind belt, which was for sale at Maggie's for $995. Amy promptly gives this to Soraya, with whom she was fighting over Amy's not sharing that Mindy was taking riding lessons at Heartland.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = Divorce Horse\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Conkie\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|18}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-11\n |ShortSummary    = Mackenzie Hutton returns to Heartland with a fianc\u00e9, Ian, who she met after dumping her real estate agent boyfriend in New York. Mackenzie has changed quite a bit from her last visit to Heartland. She has given up the pretense of allergies to gluten, dairy, sugar, food that is not certified organic, and caffeine. She is also much more relaxed and happy with her easygoing husband-to-be in the picture. She has also taken a page from Lou's book and quit her job to be her own boss, running a little art gallery in [[Greenwich Village|the Village]]. When Mackenzie arrives at Heartland, she is talking about a small wedding (under 50 guests) held outside near the dude ranch, with a BBQ cookout reception. Lisa (with the best of intentions) meddles with Lou's plans for Mackenzie, since she knows the Huttons and their high-society lifestyle. Lisa and Mackenzie's mom convince her that she would be happier with a sit-down reception dinner and a tent and roses and peonies for table settings, rather than what she and Ian had been hoping for. Lisa also meddles in Lou's personal life, giving her email to a friend, who passed it on to another friend's single son. Peter, the young man, emails Lou, but she has to decide if she wants to respond. In the meantime, Amy has been treating another horse for Lisa, an [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] beauty named Diva. Lisa claims the horse is cursed, calling her \"Diva girl, the divorce horse\", as everyone who has owned the horse has become divorced. She is moody and temperamental, and Lisa asks Amy to figure her out, since Diva has been returned three times after being rehomed. With Ty and Caleb's help, Amy determines that Diva just needs to be a horse, and hates to be kept in a stall. Unfortunately, this means that Lisa cannot sell her as a show horse. She ultimately decides to give Diva to Mackenzie, who had taken a real shine to her, and would be able to keep her at her inlaws' ranch in Montana. While Mackenzie and Ian had been fighting during the episode over whether to even get married after their plans were hijacked, they resolve their differences and remember how much they love one another. The episode ends with Mackenzie and Ian saying their vows in the company of the Heartland family, at sunset in front of the dude ranch cabins and overlooking the pond.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 26\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n |Title           = Seismic Shifts\n |DirectedBy      = TW Peacocke\n |WrittenBy       = Susin Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|2|8}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-12\n |ShortSummary    = Bedford Oil comes to Hudson and begins to conduct [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil exploration]] on Jack's property, using [[Reflection seismology#Hydrocarbon exploration|seismic testing]] and exploratory oil wells. Mallory tells Lou that there is little to be done, as the oil companies can do as they please. Feeling shocked by the injustice of it, Lou  mobilizes the community against Bedford. She holds a town hall meeting where she invites local community members, their [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]], and a representative from Bedford Oil, who shows up and turns out to be PW (Peter Walter) Morris, the company owner. Tim shares a contrasting perspective with Lou privately, saying that he would be glad to have a well installed on his property, for the royalties he would be paid. Mallory is reading [[Wuthering Heights]] and becomes convinced that Amy and Ty are Catherine and Heathcliff, meant to be together but thwarted by circumstance. Amy is working on desensitizing a horse named Acorn to noise and struggles to make progress with the oil company blasting at the edge of Jack's land. Ashley and Caleb become roommates, as Ashley leaves Briar Ridge again after fighting with her mother. Mallory discovers that the two fishermen staying at the dude ranch are actually working for the oil company, when she is cleaning their cabin and discovers their fishing gear left behind. Lou kicks them out, though they protest that they had paid for several days more. Lou continues to hold a grudge against Lisa and avoid her company, though she continues to instant message with the man that Lisa gave Lou's email to. By the end of the episode, Lisa apologizes to Lou and they have an honest conversation, making up in the process. Lou meets PW in town twice, spilling coffee on his shirt both times. He seems somewhat interested in her, but she shuts him down. Lou agrees to meet \"Internet guy\" as Mallory has dubbed him, who turns out to be none other than PW. Neither one of them were able to make the connection, though, as both used their first names - Peter and Samantha. Lou lets practical considerations (the fact that Peter is \"an oil guy\") get in the way of having a relationship (or even a date) with Peter. Nonetheless, they wind up kissing on the street in front of Maggie's. Lou starts to leave, returns to kiss him again, and then says that their attraction cannot go anywhere, ending the episode on a small cliffhanger. \n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 27\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n |Title           = Do or Die\n |DirectedBy      = TW Peacocke\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Haroun\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|2|15}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-13\n |ShortSummary    = Ty's former probation officer, Clint, brings two troubled kids to the ranch, hoping that they can learn something from Ty and the ranch where he sorted out his problems. The two kids, Tara and Badger, seem to be at the far end of the spectrum relative to Ty, starting off their stay by burning an [[Adirondack chair]] at the dude ranch and putting peanut butter in the muffin Clint was eating -- knowing he was allergic to peanuts. Tara is a [[Goth subculture|goth]], and Badger is a boy who never talks. They clash with most of the family, and especially Mallory. Tara teases her by calling her a cheerleader, [[Hilary Duff]], and similar names that reflect her perception of Mallory as a peppy \"nice girl\". Ty and Badger fight from the beginning, when he refuses to put out his cigarette and later lets all of the horses in the barn out. Tara follows Ty around a bit, making reference to them being alike, thinking she knows his experiences. Mallory eventually makes peace with Tara by sharing her own story about her parents leaving her at Heartland to go on the road. Tara responds dismissively, but Mallory says she should realize that other people have problems too. After this, Tara comes around. Mallory even persuades her to take a riding lesson, making a deal with Tara that Mallory will try out the goth look and attitude in exchange. Amy takes them back to the dude ranch so that she can watch them and there will be enough room for everyone, then sits outside with Ty by the fire as Mallory and Tara have a pillow fight. Ty confides that he didn't want the other foster kids at Heartland because he doesn't want to be a poster boy for the rehabilitation program. Ty reveals that his mother remarried a man who was horrible to them both. He made a vow to pay him back for the pain he inflicted, and when he did, the neighbours called the cops. At this point, Ty met Clint, who was supposed to deal with the hopeless cases. Amy is happy that Ty finally shared his story, and tells him that she's happy Clint brought him to Heartland.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 28\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n |Title           = Dark Horse\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|1}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-5\n |ShortSummary    = When a county by-law threatens to separate elderly Mrs. Bell from her beloved pony Sugarfoot, Lou revives the Hudson Charity Derby to raise money for a legal defense fund. This reawakens an old rivalry between Tim and Jack, who were the reason the derby became defunct many years previously. Both dispute who won, because Tim won by going off-course during the race. Both sign up for this derby to settle their score. Kit drops off her horse Money (short for You're so Money), whom she thought was a chuckwagon horse, to Heartland for rehoming. Scott looks at the horse and determines that he has a tattoo, meaning he was a racehorse. Ty looks up Money's records and discovers that he was a success when racing. Amy helps get Tim's [[palomino]] horse in shape for the race, as Tim is still having difficulty riding due to his shoulder. Ty helps Jack train on their \"secret weapon\" because Jack's horse, Paint, is too old to race in the derby. Tim and Jack are doing well in the race, until Tim falls off his horse and Jack stops to help him. Scott wins the race and Tim and Jack tie for second (although Tim's horse was ahead by a little bit, if you watch closely). Amy and Ty are recruited to be spotters at the halfway point, which doesn't work out, as the walkie talkies that Amy and Lou communicate on are unable to connect properly over such a distance. Ty and Amy start play-fighting and almost kiss. Ashley's mom offers to sponsor Caleb so he can join the professional rodeo circuit and leave Hudson. This episode features some comic relief between Jack and Tim - Tim offers Jack hay, and Jack thinks it will be free. They haggle over price, and Jack plans to take the hay. They disagree later, and he comes back to return the hay. In all, the hay is lifted onto and taken off of the bed of Jack's truck no less than four times.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n |Title           = The Ties That Bind\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Penny Gummerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|8}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-16\n |ShortSummary    = The episode opens with Amy and Spartan out on a ride as dusk is falling. For no clear reason, Spartan is acting a bit uneasy. This part of the episode is filmed as if through the eyes of someone watching Amy and her horse, always with trees between the scene and the audience. When they return to the barn, Amy also seems uneasy, and decides not to let Ty turn Spartan out with the other horses overnight. That night, Amy tosses and turns, seeing the night her mom died in her dreams, while Wes breaks into the barn and escapes with Spartan. When Amy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to check on him, she discovers that Spartan is gone. The family speaks to the police to track Spartan, but Ty and Amy also spend the next couple weeks checking horse auctions to see if Spartan turns up. They visit the Highwood Auction, and Ty buys a two-year-old [[Bay horse|bay]] gelding named Harley. Amy is angry that he spent the money he'd been saving for a motorcycle on a horse, but he says that he's almost a motorcycle, due to the name. Amy starts to storm out, but Ty stops her when he sees Spartan turn up. Spartan is there and Wes buys him \"legally\". Amy tries to prove that Spartan is her horse, but she doesn't possess a bill of sale, and current registration papers don't prove it without one. Wes is unable to leave with Spartan right away because Ty slashed his tires to ensure he couldn't leave before they talked to the brand inspector. Ty chases down Wes later, hoping to buy Spartan back, but Wes refuses to sell him for any price. Amy later plans to return and steal Spartan from the auction house, and Ty tries to talk her out of it, saying it's a [[felony]]. (This is actually untrue in Alberta, as [[Summary conviction offences|indictable offences]] are applied in Canada. This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show.) In the end, Ty reluctantly agrees to help her that evening. Ty gets caught and taken to jail, where Jack bails him out, but he may still be convicted. Jack and Tim track down Wes and force him to sign a bill of sale, returning Spartan and preventing similar problems for Amy in the future. Jack also talks to Constable Rodriguez, who promises to destroy the file on Ty's theft attempt. Ty instead has to do 200 hours of community service, and Amy is grounded until further notice. Mallory's horse, Copper, is scared of her because of her \"goth\" look, so she returns to her normal style by the end of the episode. Lou is apprehensive of revealing to her family that she is dating an oil guy, and goes to extreme measures to avoid them seeing her with Peter. Caleb gets his rodeo card, and Val offers him a sponsorship to go on the road and stay away from Ashley. Caleb debates whether to take it, and talks to both Ty and Kit about it. In the end, he decides to go, and does so at the end of the episode.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n |Title           = Full Circle\n |DirectedBy      = Don McBrearty\n |WrittenBy       = Penny Gummerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|15}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-17\n |ShortSummary    = Spartan refuses to jump for Amy and she is suffering from the trauma of having him stolen, so Amy takes him to Marion's [[Aboriginal Canadian]] friend Victor Whitetail who helps people connect with their horses. He helps Amy process her feelings and heal, using traditional Aboriginal methods. Victor was more than friends with Marion after Tim left. Peter books the entire dude ranch in order to spend time with Lou, who continues to keep him a secret from her family. Peter is forced to tell Lou he has an ex-wife when he has to take care of their dog, Max. Lou promises to let him meet her family, now that she knows more about his. Ty breaks Harley while Amy stays at Victor's, but gets into a fight with Kit when she tries to show him her methods. Later, Ty breaks up with Kit, realizing he has feelings for Amy; when she returns, he tells her he can't continue being only friends.

Jack says it will make them dependent on people. At dinner, Mallory reveals that Ty has earned his high school diploma and later tells Amy that he's at a crossroads, and asks if Amy has any plans. She replies that she's working on it. Her method is revealed when we see Amy talking about sneaking up to the fishing cabin with Ty to feed the horses, which will also give them a great opportunity to talk. Jack comes into the barn to tell them that it's now necessary to feed the horses, and the three of them can go up that weekend. However, Lou has weekend plans and Mallory and Jake have nowhere to stay, so Jack winds up looking after them. This leaves Amy and Ty free to follow through with their plans, ''in the open.'' When they arrive, Amy and Ty spread out the hay for the horses, and Ty collapses after thinking he sees Ghost. (This is the second time that Ghost shows up when Ty is in danger.) Ty develops a high fever, but no one else can reach the fishing cabin because the highway is closed. Lou was heading to a spa with Peter along one of the mountain highways, but they were forced to turn back due to the closures. Lou made an attempt to tell Jack about Peter, but Mallory and Jake spilled something in the other room, and Jack took them to Maggie's. When they return, Lou introduces Peter to Jack, who is incredibly unhappy that Lou is dating an oil guy, even calling him the enemy. However, after Amy contacts Jack via the cabin's shortwave radio, Peter organizes snowplows to clear the highway in the morning, and Jack grudgingly accepts him. Amy cares for Ty overnight, and his fever eventually breaks. It turns out that Ghost really was there, not a hallucination of Ty's brought on by illness. Upon seeing Ghost outside, the pair go out to greet him, and Amy begins to talk about what Ty said. She agrees they can't just be friends, admitting that she loves him. Ty finally tells Amy his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Val gets her test results back, and they are negative. Val tells Ashley that she sponsored Caleb, which causes Ashley to become upset with her mom and Caleb. When he returns to his trailer, Ashley kicks him out. Later, Val is driving along, and pulls over to answer her phone and discover that she needs further tests. Jack gives Tim a loan, since Tim was thinking of selling land to Val to be able to afford to continue after losing his herd of cattle, which would turn Val into Jack's neighbour on both sides. Once they return to Heartland, Amy and Ty get cozy on the couch. He makes Amy say she loves him again, and they kiss.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2009\u201310)===\n{{Plot|season|date=March 2020}}{{Episode table |background=#006600 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |director=20 |writer=22 |airdate=16 |prodcode=8 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Miracle\n |DirectedBy      = Steve DiMarco\n |WrittenBy       = [[Heather Conkie]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-1\n |ShortSummary    = When a coach bus and a horse trailer collide on Highway 95, they block the route for Amy's school bus to get to her high school. Ignoring a command to stay on the bus, Amy goes to help Caesar, a [[Gray horse|grey]] gelding with Olympic prospects, stuck in a barbed wire fence. Amy calms him down while his trainer, Stuart Forrest, cuts the barbed wire to free him. When Amy turns around, a crowd has gathered to watch, with several individuals filming her. One of these recordings is presented on the news, causing Heartland to become famous overnight. Amy struggles to keep up with the pressure while trying to heal Caesar, who is spooked by loud noises, cars, and horse trailers after the accident. Amy earns the nickname \"Miracle Girl\", which she likes even less than the comments of \"horse whispering\" when people talked about Marion's and her gift previously. Ty applied for a vet program, and accepted an offer from Scott to apprentice/intern with him in the meantime. Ty begins to question his decision after his first job with Scott was to help at the scene of the accident, which included the [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] of a few severely injured horses. Caleb punches Ty for hurting Kit, saying that he had warned him not to. Jack lets Caleb stay in the loft with Ty, as Caleb is living in his truck, unable to get his trailer back from Ashley. She starts working at Maggie's to afford to live on her own. Amy and Ty make plans to get Ashley and Caleb back together, so Ty doesn't have to listen to his snoring. Lisa comes back from France and asks Jack if he misses her when she is away. Jack explains that he misses her, but there's a lot going on at the ranch to occupy his time. Tim buys a new herd of cows with some of the money that Jack lent him. Jack gets upset, but Lisa tells him that he can't tell Tim how to use the loan. Jack asks Val about her deal with Tim, and she says there isn't one. He also asks her how she's feeling, and she says that her doctor says she is in remission, but \"this blood thing's a tricky customer\". This seems to imply that Val had one of the blood cancers ([[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], or [[myeloma]]) which was treated successfully in the time between seasons. Val hasn't told Ashley, not wanting to worry her, and she thanks Jack for taking her to her appointments, saying he is a true friend.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 33\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Little Secrets\n |DirectedBy      = Steve DiMarco\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-2\n |ShortSummary    = Amy finds herself caught in a family crisis when she tries to help a 10-year-old girl, Taylor Kennedy, and her horse Trooper recover from what appears to be a freak accident. Taylor was in a full-body cast after Trooper started galloping apparently out of the blue, and she fell off. Trooper also lunges at Taylor when they first arrive, and Amy notes that she has only seen this with abused horses. Ty thinks it is unlikely that a young girl would abuse her horse, but Mallory cautions that they shouldn't underestimate Taylor. After Amy has been working with Trooper and Taylor together for a while, getting her to spend time with her horse and then grooming him together, she assesses that the horse is fine, and that perhaps the problem lies with Taylor. Amy also finds out that the Kennedys are getting divorced, and that Taylor will go to any lengths to get them to stay together. Taylor also almost hurts Trooper one night while he's in Heartland's care, advancing on him with a large branch in hand, while Mallory looks on. She also gets on and hits him with a riding crop to make him gallop like he did during the accident. Amy stops them before they reach a cliff, but then Taylor starts running. Amy catches her and reveals that she's pieced together the mystery. When they return to the ranch, Amy takes Kate Kennedy aside and tells her that her daughter needs some professional help (Amy says she can help Trooper, but she can't help Taylor). Amy offers to take care of Trooper while Taylor's problems are sorted out, however long that takes. In the meantime, Heartland continues to be very busy thanks to Amy's reputation as the \"Miracle Girl\", meaning that Jack is making extra pens behind the barn to deal with more horses, and Lou and Tim are thinking about expansion plans for the dude ranch. Amy is also treating Roxy, a horse that is barn sour (meaning she is reluctant to leave her stall). Ashley and Caleb continue to be at odds, and Amy brings Soraya into her and Ty's plans to get them back together. The two girls talk to Ashley, but she has figured out what they are up to (and why), and asks them to stay out of it.

Lisa and the rest of the family try to convince him to upgrade. They persuade him to visit the Chevy dealership, and he comes home with a new grey Silverado, after trading in his old truck for $1000. However, he continues to complain about the truck, its seat settings, its lack of comfort, etc. He becomes upset, and takes the truck up to the fishing cabin. The family can't understand why Jack is so attached to his old truck, but the audience learns through a flashback sequence that Jack's late wife, Amy and Lou's grandmother, Lyndy bought him the 1972 Chevrolet Cheyenne 10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gyy7WyFtazEC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22totally+tougher+to+last+longer%22&source=bl&ots=M_NWJi3uMD&sig=Ov2wy9rvpok-K7XGjUgzyeogrN0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi33b3l3fvVAhWnhlQKHYZKBKIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Field & Stream|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|via=Google Books}}</ref> as an anniversary gift early in their marriage. In the meantime, Amy is trying to help a horse named Duke, whose stable-mate died recently, by trying to get him to bond with Pegasus. Mallory and Jake stop by, looking for Kramer, Jake's black-and-white paint cow pony, who has a habit of escaping from pens by jumping the fences. When they find him, they ask Amy to solve his problem. Amy recognizes that the horse actually jumps fences without provocation, simply because he loves to jump. Amy's solution is for Mallory to take Kramer around a jumping course regularly, to keep his extra energy in check and make him behave for Jake's family. Kramer also helps Amy with Duke, because the two horses become fast friends. She is then able to get Duke to socialize with the other horses and to get over his grief. The end-of-school dance is also coming up fast, and Amy and Ty are supposed to go together. Amy was going to use one of Lou's old dresses, but Lisa gives her a beautiful turquoise gown from Paris. Ty is worried because he doesn't know how to dance, so he takes lessons from Lou (and Peter, who's back from a business trip to Dubai). Amy and Ty head out to their dance, but Ty's truck breaks down. Instead, they wind up dancing in the bed of the truck, and Ty presents Amy with a promise ring. Ashley asks a rich boy from a private school to go with her as a date to the dance to make Caleb jealous. Caleb hitches his trailer to his truck, and tries to pull it away, but he and Ashley wind up laughing about it before she drives off with the other boy. Jack's problems with the new truck are solved when he finds a used truck, much like his old one, but in much better shape. Old Goldie (the old truck) is brought back to the farm as a \"lawn ornament\" and sits beside another old, dead truck.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 35\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = The Haunting of Hanley Barn\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Haroun\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|25}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-4\n |ShortSummary    = Something is scaring the horses at night in the Hanley Barn and Amy is called in to investigate. At first, Amy thinks it might be the feed, but Mr. Hanley rejects this suggestion as he'd already talked about it with the vet. Amy agrees to come back that night to investigate further, and Ty comes with her at Jack's request. Meanwhile, Badger returns to Heartland, having run away from his foster home to see his birth parents, but they had moved without leaving him any contact information. He talks to Ty about it, saying that he needs somewhere to stay overnight. Ty lets him stay temporarily, and Mallory finds Badger sketching by the lake. Both seem interested in each other, as Badger almost tells Mallory she looks more grown-up than before, and Mallory asks about Tara, who Badger seemed to be dating when they first showed up in Season 2. Clint stops by looking for Badger, and Ty pretends he hasn't seen him, to give Badger some time to cool off before having to return to his foster home. Mallory steals food for Badger, and the story returns to Amy. She and Ty are at Maggie's, and Ty asks why everyone thinks the barn is haunted. Soraya, Amy, Ashley, and Mallory recount the tale: A young man was working at the Hanley place, and fell in love with the farmer's daughter. One night, the barn erupted into flame and all the horses, as well as the young man, died in the fire. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hanley's parents bought the farm from the previous owners and they built a new barn on top of the original's location. Now it is believed that The Drifter, the young man, haunts the barn, and he is portrayed as wearing a black cloak, with a hook for a hand, and no face under his hood. Just then, Caleb bangs in, wearing a heavy black cloak because the weather's turning. Amy and Ty go to the Hanley place, and spend several hours just playing cards. While they are there, Caleb, Soraya, and Ashley show up to scare them (in which they succeed). Noises come from upstairs, which Amy had noticed earlier in the day. Amy and Ty investigate, despite Mr. Hanley's previous warning that the loft is strictly off-limits. They discover Mallory and Badger upstairs, and tell them to go home. At this point, Mr. Hanley appears and explains that the loft has dry rot, which is why he told Amy not to go upstairs. In the end, Amy discovers that Mr. Hanley's neighbour, Brett, has been spiking the horses' feed with a [[carbohydrate loading|glycogen loader]], meant to give horses energy, which is the reason they are so worked up in the morning. He wants to force Mr. Hanley into foreclosure, so he can buy the land. Once that problem's solved, Ty decides to help Badger by coaching him through how to apologize to Clint, which Badger does. Ty also tells Badger to come back to Heartland if he runs away again, so that he'll be safe. Later, Mallory flips through Badger's sketchpad while he's not around and sees a drawing of her. She asks him about it, and they wind up kissing. Lou is planning on visiting Peter in Denver, Colorado, for a single day while he has a layover on his way back to Dubai. Jack disapproves, and says it's an awful long distance to travel for a single day together. Lou can't understand why he's so easy on Amy and hard on her, but Jack eventually reveals it's because Amy reminds him so much of Marion, and Lou reminds him of himself. He also says that he worries about when she'll leave again, possibly for New York, or ''worse'' (in his eyes), Toronto. Mrs. Bell comes over to use the kitchen to make strawberry jam with Lou's help. While she's there, Mrs. Bell reminisces, and tells Mallory, about Thomas Ritter (aka The Drifter), her first boyfriend. She gave him a jar of jam, and he returned the empty jar with a butterfly in it. Towards the end of the episode, Mrs. Bell brings a butterfly in a jar to the grave at the Hanley farm where he was buried, and releases it in his memory. \n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 36\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Glory Days\n |DirectedBy      = [[Don McBrearty]]\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|11|1}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-5\n |ShortSummary    = In the hopes of impressing Ashley, Caleb takes lessons in [[Steer wrestling|bulldogging]] from former rodeo champion Tim, who considers getting back into competition, and refuses to acknowledge that he may no longer have what it takes. Amy helps them with this. Tim pays Jack back for his loan in cows, and Jack relives his glory days as well, working with the cattle herd. He realizes he can't do it alone, and gets Tim's help, ''for a price''. Tim wants a paycheque and grazing fees, meaning the herd of cattle might not be much of a return of the loan. Kit's barrel horse is foaling, and Ty helps Scott check on the mare while waiting for her time to come. They talk, and Kit congratulates him on getting accepted to two pre-vet university programs (at the [[University of Manitoba]], and Grasslands Agricultural College). Kit says she knew he could do it, though he struggled with Grade 12 Algebra. (This is another regional error: she means Math 30 Pure, as Alberta's high school maths are broken down only into Pure (university prep)/Applied (college prep) and Math 31 (calculus), not into algebra, geometry, etc., like some other provinces.) Ty assists Scott with the delivery, which is complicated by the fact that the foal is upside down. Its head and right foreleg get stuck while Scott tries to turn it, and the foal is [[stillborn]]. Kit and Ty sort out their lingering break-up issues while Ty comforts Kit, who is visibly upset. After the birth, the mare refuses to leave the dead foal alone, so they try to get her to bond with an orphaned foal, Merlin, instead. It's hard going at first, but Amy comes over to help and rubs the foal with the blanket that was on the dead foal, making him smell like the mare's foal. At that point, the mare accepts Merlin and he's able to nurse, which seems to be a success. Lou invites Peter to manage his business from the Heartland facilities while his office in Calgary undergoes renovation, which soon turns out to be a mistake. Peter also interferes with Lou and Mallory's agreement for Copper, telling Mallory that she has actually completely paid off her share of Copper's ownership, and then some. Caleb repays Val for her sponsorship, and he talks about his reasons for trying bulldogging. He thinks it will be safer, but Tim later tells him that it's even more dangerous than bronc riding, because there are more variables with more animals. Val tells Ashley that Caleb's a good guy, and tells her that the money was repaid. Val asks Ashley to forgive her and give her a second chance and Ashley moves back to Briar Ridge. While she's leaving, she seems to make her peace with Caleb.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 37\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Growing Pains\n |DirectedBy      = Don McBrearty\n |WrittenBy       = [[Susin Nielsen]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|11|8}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-6\n |ShortSummary    = After Daisy rejects the orphan foal Merlin, Scott brings the colt (played by a filly) to Amy to care for him. Ty and Amy split the every two hour feedings 24x7. The stress of the schedule and differences in foal (read child) rearing lead Amy and Ty to clash over how best to raise Merlin. Lou arranges a meeting for Peter with a famously wealthy and eco-minded oil billionaire Richard Chenoweth at the Heartland facilities. Something about Richard seems off whenever Peter is out of earshot. The local wildlife official warns Jack about a cougar in the area. The cougar's presence in Heartland is unmistakable, eventually causing Richard to fall off his horse during a trail ride with Lou and Peter. After Peter comes to Lou's defense following unwanted advances from Richard, Lou must defuse a threatened lawsuit from the unscrupulous businessman. Lou is successful and in a most satisfying manner.

Meanwhile, Lou is searching for dude ranch horses and she is at odds with Tim over which horses to buy.

Their plans change because Scott happens to be on call, and the dude ranch's first customers arrive a week early: an odd middle-aged couple who are travel bloggers. Lou goes out of her way to please them, thinking that their reviews could make or break her new venture. While on the cattle drive, Amy and Ty talk for the first time about his absence and clear the air between them. Ty comes close to telling Amy how he feels, and they kiss. Lisa tells Jack that she loves him, and they kiss too. Tim buys Big River Ranch and the infamous [[Texas longhorn|longhorns]], and finds himself attracted to Ray's daughter Callie.

While checking a log on the trail to make sure it's safe to jump, Mallory doesn't notice Spartan leave. She finds him grazing at the side of the road relatively quickly, but doesn't notice the signs indicating recent pesticide application. Once they return to the ranch, it becomes evident something is wrong, which Ty correctly guesses to be pesticide poisoning. Ty looks into Marion's notebooks, and gets Mallory's help to mix charcoal and water. Caleb and his friend Kit, who Ty met accidentally while she was bathing in the pond early that morning, show up. Ty explains the situation, and they get Spartan to drink all the jugs of charcoal water together. Meanwhile, Lou's friends work out their problems with each other, themselves, and their love lives. Lou's friend Lauren kisses Tim, who pushes her away, and Lou becomes upset with her friend. Lou admits Scott said no to her proposal because he wasn't sure, and that she doesn't know how they stand now. At the end of the trip, Lou feels bad for the fight that happened among the girls the previous night and tries to apologize, but the girls say it was therapeutic, and they will be sure to spread the word in New York about the Heartland Equestrian Connection.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Holding Fast\n |DirectedBy      = Tim Southam\n |WrittenBy       = [[Susin Nielsen]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|11|9}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-5\n |ShortSummary    = Out for a ride along the river, Amy comes across an RCMP officer trying to save a young boy from drowning.

She discovers the connection to the trauma of Constable Rodriguez's brother drowning six years earlier, for which he still feels responsible, and ends up helping both the horse and the officer.  Lou goes to a polo match for Nick Harwell's polo team, as he gave her a number of free tickets, and upsets Scott when Nick talks about hiring him and Lou praises his work. Scott and Lou talk about the state of their relationship, and they break up for real. Lisa tries to convince Jack to go to the polo match with her, but he refuses.  Jack shows up just as the match starts and apologizes to Lisa for being so stubborn. Ashley takes Caleb to the polo club with her and shares her new pursuit of barrel racing (which Kit is teaching her) with her mother's friends, much to Val's chagrin. Ty asks Amy out on a date, but she already has plans with Caleb. Mallory tries to get rid of Jake, using lame excuses to avoid seeing him and ignoring his phone calls. Jack facilitates an honest conversation between the two, frustrated with their beating around the bush and hoping to get some peace.

Ty competes in [[Rodeo#\"Rough stock\" competition|bull riding]] when someone who was entered doesn't show up, and Amy becomes upset, concerned for his safety. Amy seems concerned over Ty and Kit's budding friendship. Ashley is noticeably upset at the party that follows the rodeo and is drinking quite heavily, and Amy learns from her that Apollo, Ashley's show jumping horse and the only horse that she had a bond with, has been sold. By the end of the night, Ashley is too intoxicated to take herself home, so Amy drives. She takes her eyes off the road and swerves, then Ashley yanks the wheel and they go off the road. Ty and Kit are headed home in his truck, and they help the girls. The next morning, Ty takes the blame for the accident, as Ashley was drunk and Amy doesn't have her drivers license.

While most of the family are awake because of the heat, Brad Borden (Ty's father) comes to Heartland with six horses in a livestock trailer designed for cattle. One of the horses is down on the floor with a bad head wound, and Jack is forced to do the merciful thing, though Amy is desperate to prevent it. The other five horses are badly dehydrated and in rough shape, but able to wait until morning, when Scott can get to Heartland from Red Deer. Amy has a feeling that she knows one of the horses, and after cleaning his face, realizes that it is Ashley's former jumper, Apollo. When Amy calls Ashley, she is distraught thinking that her mother sold Apollo to a meat truck. In fairness, Val thought that the horse dealer she sold to was reputable. Ashley smashes the windows of Val's SUV with a golf club and runs away from home, despite Val's threats to cut her off financially. Ashley spends much of the episode working and living at the dude ranch, and considering dropping out of high school. Ty is upset with his father for leaving him alone in Calgary, resulting in some bad things for Ty. Amy, Ty, Caleb, and Mallory work together to  care for the horses which ends in a water fight. When the rain finally comes and cools off the heat, Ty and Amy go outside and kiss, but Ty breaks it off, worrying he is like his dad and saying he doesn't want to hurt Amy. Once the horses are cared for, Lou deals with the logistics by making a deal with their owner (a horse dealer) to buy the five healthy horses for $2000.  However, Brad takes the money and leaves abruptly in the middle of the night, after receiving a call from the men that are still expecting his to return their money. Constable Rodriguez comes to the rescue when it looks like the horses will have to go back to the dealer, and the family keep the horses to use on trail rides for the dude ranch.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Showdown!\n |DirectedBy      = [[Sudz Sutherland]]\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|12|7}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-8\n |ShortSummary    = Amy and Soraya return to school, and Amy makes a bunch of schedules so that Caleb and Ty will do most of the work, and she won't have to fall behind in her studies this year. However, there have been some mysterious [[cattle raiding|cattle rustlers]] roaming about stealing many ranchers' cows and the ranchers are getting worried. Tim is one such rancher, and he hires both Caleb and Ty to watch his herd. This angers Amy, as she knows they won't have enough time to do most of the regular chores at the ranch as well. When she expresses this anger to Caleb, he kisses her and tells her that she thinks too much. The next day, Ty and Kit are having fun while working on schoolwork in the back of his truck, and they kiss. By this time, they had become close, and she had helped Ty apply to take online courses to complete his high-school diploma. Mallory discovered at the start of the episode that her parents had important news that could only be shared face-to-face. Her father has a gold record, and is going on tour to promote it. Since they can't be around to take care of her, Mallory is to be sent to Blessed Virgin Academy, an all-girls boarding school. There is a touching moment as she leaves the ranch. The tension continues to increase in this episode, as the ranchers become more and more concerned about their cattle. The police try to help track the rustlers, but they work swiftly, observing herds from a helicopter, then cutting fence lines and rounding up the cattle, driving them into a livestock trailer and escaping. Lou feels torn, as she has started seeing Mark Rodriguez, to whom her father is becoming increasingly hostile, feeling that the constable is inept at his job of preventing livestock theft. The episode reaches its climax when Ty and Caleb watch as the cattle rustlers turn up to steal Tim's herd of cattle. Amy rides off in search of the ranch hands when she finds no work completed in the barn, and comes across the same scene, but one of the rustlers causes Spartan to rear, dropping Amy to the ground. Ty and Caleb come to help her, and she manages to escape, but the rustler has a gun and they stop advancing towards the scene of the crime. Jack drives up with Tim in tow, tipped off by Ashley, and try to stop the rustlers, but they are outnumbered. Amy sees this, and comes running towards them, calling, \"Dad!\" The rustlers turn, guns in hand, and shoot towards her; Tim takes a bullet to protect Amy. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with no indication of where the bullet got Tim or whether he will survive, and the cattle rustlers drive off with his entire herd (minus the two longhorns).\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = True Enough\n |DirectedBy      = Sudz Sutherland\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Conkie\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-9\n |ShortSummary    = The episode prolongs the cliffhanger as long as possible, not referring to what happened to Tim, showing an influx of food from friends of the family (which usually corresponds with a funeral) and a conversation between Lou and Jack about Amy, saying that it's good she went on a ride. She is even seen riding past the cemetery where her mom was buried in the first episode. Tim turns out to have been injured in his right shoulder, and he is wearing a sling. Tim becomes a source of tension in the household, constantly ringing a bell and expecting to be served. Amy is feeling guilty for being the cause of his bullet wound (although indirectly), and she heals while caring for another horse. Amy's teacher, Ruth Adams, is trying to sell her father's old chestnut, Boxer. Amy and Ty try to help him settle in while they work on rehoming him, by bringing Hank Adams to visit his horse. While he is there, Ruth shows up, very upset that her father was brought to the ranch, revealing that Hank has Alzheimer's. Despite being fuzzy about who his daughter is, Hank clearly remembers Boxer and even Jack. Jack eventually remembers that Hank was the lead guitarist for his wife, Lyndy, when she was a singer professionally. Jack had brought out an old record of hers to listen to, and they listen to it while talking with the Adams. Hank spontaneously picks up a guitar and starts playing the song in time with the record. In the end, Amy offers to keep Boxer so that Hank can visit him while he is able, and Ruth accepts this offer. While Tim is wearing out his welcome with Jack, Callie Phillips shows up and starts taking care of Tim. It seems they have been seeing each other since the cattle drive earlier in the season, and she stays at Big River whenever she is in town. This is quite a shock to the girls, who had no idea that Tim had a girlfriend. Amy is the least comfortable with it, and is fairly rude to Callie while she stays with them overnight. In the meantime, Lou is still seeing Mark, and enjoying it, even making him a mixed CD of police-related songs (whether by theme or artists' name). However, they were supposed to take a trip to the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and have lunch there, but Mark says he is busy going to a provincial review meeting in Edmonton. This turns out to be a lie when Lou sees him kissing a blonde in Hudson, in his truck. He tries to explain that he didn't think they were exclusive, but Lou dumps him without a second thought. Ty is on a date with Kit, and Caleb tells Amy that Ty gave her up too easily. Caleb then shares a kiss with an enthusiastic Amy. Callie and Tim get in a fight, but get back together, and she takes him back to Big River, and finally out of Jack's hair.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n |Title           = Starstruck!\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|1|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-10\n |ShortSummary    = Hollywood starlet and gossip-rag fodder Mindy Fanshaw arrives at Heartland under the pretext of honing her riding skills, which turn out to be non-existent. Mallory is found hiding in one of the dude ranch cabins, having been aided in her 'escape' from the boarding school by Jake. Mallory collects items Mindy has used around Heartland, planning to sell them on eBay so she can repay Jake for the money he spent helping her. Mindy digs into the Ty/Amy/Caleb 'triangle', lying to all three about what the others had said and attempts to pit the three against each other. She attacks Amy in particular for being unable to choose between Ty and Caleb or express how she feels about either guy. When Mindy ropes Caleb into taking her on a trail ride, she insists on riding an ailing Pegasus, ignoring Amy's warning that the horse should not be used. This results in a calculated photo-op for Mindy with paparazzi tipped off by her agent. The photographers get too close and spook Pegasus, dropping Mindy off his back, but causing stone bruises and a chipped bone for Pegasus. Lou eventually kicks Mindy out for behaving as a spoiled rich girl and disrupting the peace at Heartland, and she drives off into the sunset. She does leave Amy a parting gift, in the form of a very flashy, one of a kind belt, which was for sale at Maggie's for $995.

Mackenzie has changed quite a bit from her last visit to Heartland. She has given up the pretense of allergies to gluten, dairy, sugar, food that is not certified organic, and caffeine. She is also much more relaxed and happy with her easygoing husband-to-be in the picture. She has also taken a page from Lou's book and quit her job to be her own boss, running a little art gallery in [[Greenwich Village|the Village]]. When Mackenzie arrives at Heartland, she is talking about a small wedding (under 50 guests) held outside near the dude ranch, with a BBQ cookout reception. Lisa (with the best of intentions) meddles with Lou's plans for Mackenzie, since she knows the Huttons and their high-society lifestyle. Lisa and Mackenzie's mom convince her that she would be happier with a sit-down reception dinner and a tent and roses and peonies for table settings, rather than what she and Ian had been hoping for. Lisa also meddles in Lou's personal life, giving her email to a friend, who passed it on to another friend's single son. Peter, the young man, emails Lou, but she has to decide if she wants to respond. In the meantime, Amy has been treating another horse for Lisa, an [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] beauty named Diva. Lisa claims the horse is cursed, calling her \"Diva girl, the divorce horse\", as everyone who has owned the horse has become divorced. She is moody and temperamental, and Lisa asks Amy to figure her out, since Diva has been returned three times after being rehomed. With Ty and Caleb's help, Amy determines that Diva just needs to be a horse, and hates to be kept in a stall. Unfortunately, this means that Lisa cannot sell her as a show horse. She ultimately decides to give Diva to Mackenzie, who had taken a real shine to her, and would be able to keep her at her inlaws' ranch in Montana. While Mackenzie and Ian had been fighting during the episode over whether to even get married after their plans were hijacked, they resolve their differences and remember how much they love one another.

Mallory tells Lou that there is little to be done, as the oil companies can do as they please. Feeling shocked by the injustice of it, Lou  mobilizes the community against Bedford. She holds a town hall meeting where she invites local community members, their [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]], and a representative from Bedford Oil, who shows up and turns out to be PW (Peter Walter) Morris, the company owner. Tim shares a contrasting perspective with Lou privately, saying that he would be glad to have a well installed on his property, for the royalties he would be paid. Mallory is reading [[Wuthering Heights]] and becomes convinced that Amy and Ty are Catherine and Heathcliff, meant to be together but thwarted by circumstance. Amy is working on desensitizing a horse named Acorn to noise and struggles to make progress with the oil company blasting at the edge of Jack's land. Ashley and Caleb become roommates, as Ashley leaves Briar Ridge again after fighting with her mother. Mallory discovers that the two fishermen staying at the dude ranch are actually working for the oil company, when she is cleaning their cabin and discovers their fishing gear left behind. Lou kicks them out, though they protest that they had paid for several days more. Lou continues to hold a grudge against Lisa and avoid her company, though she continues to instant message with the man that Lisa gave Lou's email to. By the end of the episode, Lisa apologizes to Lou and they have an honest conversation, making up in the process. Lou meets PW in town twice, spilling coffee on his shirt both times. He seems somewhat interested in her, but she shuts him down. Lou agrees to meet \"Internet guy\" as Mallory has dubbed him, who turns out to be none other than PW. Neither one of them were able to make the connection, though, as both used their first names - Peter and Samantha. Lou lets practical considerations (the fact that Peter is \"an oil guy\") get in the way of having a relationship (or even a date) with Peter. Nonetheless, they wind up kissing on the street in front of Maggie's. Lou starts to leave, returns to kiss him again, and then says that their attraction cannot go anywhere, ending the episode on a small cliffhanger. \n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 27\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n |Title           = Do or Die\n |DirectedBy      = TW Peacocke\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Haroun\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|2|15}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-13\n |ShortSummary    = Ty's former probation officer, Clint, brings two troubled kids to the ranch, hoping that they can learn something from Ty and the ranch where he sorted out his problems. The two kids, Tara and Badger, seem to be at the far end of the spectrum relative to Ty, starting off their stay by burning an [[Adirondack chair]] at the dude ranch and putting peanut butter in the muffin Clint was eating -- knowing he was allergic to peanuts. Tara is a [[Goth subculture|goth]], and Badger is a boy who never talks. They clash with most of the family, and especially Mallory. Tara teases her by calling her a cheerleader, [[Hilary Duff]], and similar names that reflect her perception of Mallory as a peppy \"nice girl\". Ty and Badger fight from the beginning, when he refuses to put out his cigarette and later lets all of the horses in the barn out. Tara follows Ty around a bit, making reference to them being alike, thinking she knows his experiences. Mallory eventually makes peace with Tara by sharing her own story about her parents leaving her at Heartland to go on the road. Tara responds dismissively, but Mallory says she should realize that other people have problems too. After this, Tara comes around. Mallory even persuades her to take a riding lesson, making a deal with Tara that Mallory will try out the goth look and attitude in exchange. Amy takes them back to the dude ranch so that she can watch them and there will be enough room for everyone, then sits outside with Ty by the fire as Mallory and Tara have a pillow fight. Ty confides that he didn't want the other foster kids at Heartland because he doesn't want to be a poster boy for the rehabilitation program. Ty reveals that his mother remarried a man who was horrible to them both. He made a vow to pay him back for the pain he inflicted, and when he did, the neighbours called the cops. At this point, Ty met Clint, who was supposed to deal with the hopeless cases. Amy is happy that Ty finally shared his story, and tells him that she's happy Clint brought him to Heartland.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 28\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n |Title           = Dark Horse\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|1}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-5\n |ShortSummary    = When a county by-law threatens to separate elderly Mrs. Bell from her beloved pony Sugarfoot, Lou revives the Hudson Charity Derby to raise money for a legal defense fund. This reawakens an old rivalry between Tim and Jack, who were the reason the derby became defunct many years previously. Both dispute who won, because Tim won by going off-course during the race. Both sign up for this derby to settle their score. Kit drops off her horse Money (short for You're so Money), whom she thought was a chuckwagon horse, to Heartland for rehoming. Scott looks at the horse and determines that he has a tattoo, meaning he was a racehorse. Ty looks up Money's records and discovers that he was a success when racing. Amy helps get Tim's [[palomino]] horse in shape for the race, as Tim is still having difficulty riding due to his shoulder. Ty helps Jack train on their \"secret weapon\" because Jack's horse, Paint, is too old to race in the derby. Tim and Jack are doing well in the race, until Tim falls off his horse and Jack stops to help him. Scott wins the race and Tim and Jack tie for second (although Tim's horse was ahead by a little bit, if you watch closely). Amy and Ty are recruited to be spotters at the halfway point, which doesn't work out, as the walkie talkies that Amy and Lou communicate on are unable to connect properly over such a distance. Ty and Amy start play-fighting and almost kiss. Ashley's mom offers to sponsor Caleb so he can join the professional rodeo circuit and leave Hudson. This episode features some comic relief between Jack and Tim - Tim offers Jack hay, and Jack thinks it will be free. They haggle over price, and Jack plans to take the hay. They disagree later, and he comes back to return the hay. In all, the hay is lifted onto and taken off of the bed of Jack's truck no less than four times.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n |Title           = The Ties That Bind\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Penny Gummerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|8}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-16\n |ShortSummary    = The episode opens with Amy and Spartan out on a ride as dusk is falling. For no clear reason, Spartan is acting a bit uneasy. This part of the episode is filmed as if through the eyes of someone watching Amy and her horse, always with trees between the scene and the audience. When they return to the barn, Amy also seems uneasy, and decides not to let Ty turn Spartan out with the other horses overnight. That night, Amy tosses and turns, seeing the night her mom died in her dreams, while Wes breaks into the barn and escapes with Spartan. When Amy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to check on him, she discovers that Spartan is gone. The family speaks to the police to track Spartan, but Ty and Amy also spend the next couple weeks checking horse auctions to see if Spartan turns up. They visit the Highwood Auction, and Ty buys a two-year-old [[Bay horse|bay]] gelding named Harley. Amy is angry that he spent the money he'd been saving for a motorcycle on a horse, but he says that he's almost a motorcycle, due to the name. Amy starts to storm out, but Ty stops her when he sees Spartan turn up. Spartan is there and Wes buys him \"legally\". Amy tries to prove that Spartan is her horse, but she doesn't possess a bill of sale, and current registration papers don't prove it without one. Wes is unable to leave with Spartan right away because Ty slashed his tires to ensure he couldn't leave before they talked to the brand inspector. Ty chases down Wes later, hoping to buy Spartan back, but Wes refuses to sell him for any price. Amy later plans to return and steal Spartan from the auction house, and Ty tries to talk her out of it, saying it's a [[felony]]. (This is actually untrue in Alberta, as [[Summary conviction offences|indictable offences]] are applied in Canada. This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show.) In the end, Ty reluctantly agrees to help her that evening. Ty gets caught and taken to jail, where Jack bails him out, but he may still be convicted. Jack and Tim track down Wes and force him to sign a bill of sale, returning Spartan and preventing similar problems for Amy in the future. Jack also talks to Constable Rodriguez, who promises to destroy the file on Ty's theft attempt. Ty instead has to do 200 hours of community service, and Amy is grounded until further notice. Mallory's horse, Copper, is scared of her because of her \"goth\" look, so she returns to her normal style by the end of the episode. Lou is apprehensive of revealing to her family that she is dating an oil guy, and goes to extreme measures to avoid them seeing her with Peter. Caleb gets his rodeo card, and Val offers him a sponsorship to go on the road and stay away from Ashley. Caleb debates whether to take it, and talks to both Ty and Kit about it. In the end, he decides to go, and does so at the end of the episode.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n |Title           = Full Circle\n |DirectedBy      = Don McBrearty\n |WrittenBy       = Penny Gummerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|3|15}}\n |ProdCode        = 146041-17\n |ShortSummary    = Spartan refuses to jump for Amy and she is suffering from the trauma of having him stolen, so Amy takes him to Marion's [[Aboriginal Canadian]] friend Victor Whitetail who helps people connect with their horses. He helps Amy process her feelings and heal, using traditional Aboriginal methods. Victor was more than friends with Marion after Tim left. Peter books the entire dude ranch in order to spend time with Lou, who continues to keep him a secret from her family. Peter is forced to tell Lou he has an ex-wife when he has to take care of their dog, Max. Lou promises to let him meet her family, now that she knows more about his. Ty breaks Harley while Amy stays at Victor's, but gets into a fight with Kit when she tries to show him her methods. Later, Ty breaks up with Kit, realizing he has feelings for Amy; when she returns, he tells her he can't continue being only friends.

Jack says it will make them dependent on people. At dinner, Mallory reveals that Ty has earned his high school diploma and later tells Amy that he's at a crossroads, and asks if Amy has any plans. She replies that she's working on it. Her method is revealed when we see Amy talking about sneaking up to the fishing cabin with Ty to feed the horses, which will also give them a great opportunity to talk. Jack comes into the barn to tell them that it's now necessary to feed the horses, and the three of them can go up that weekend. However, Lou has weekend plans and Mallory and Jake have nowhere to stay, so Jack winds up looking after them. This leaves Amy and Ty free to follow through with their plans, ''in the open.'' When they arrive, Amy and Ty spread out the hay for the horses, and Ty collapses after thinking he sees Ghost. (This is the second time that Ghost shows up when Ty is in danger.) Ty develops a high fever, but no one else can reach the fishing cabin because the highway is closed. Lou was heading to a spa with Peter along one of the mountain highways, but they were forced to turn back due to the closures. Lou made an attempt to tell Jack about Peter, but Mallory and Jake spilled something in the other room, and Jack took them to Maggie's. When they return, Lou introduces Peter to Jack, who is incredibly unhappy that Lou is dating an oil guy, even calling him the enemy. However, after Amy contacts Jack via the cabin's shortwave radio, Peter organizes snowplows to clear the highway in the morning, and Jack grudgingly accepts him. Amy cares for Ty overnight, and his fever eventually breaks. It turns out that Ghost really was there, not a hallucination of Ty's brought on by illness. Upon seeing Ghost outside, the pair go out to greet him, and Amy begins to talk about what Ty said. She agrees they can't just be friends, admitting that she loves him. Ty finally tells Amy his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Val gets her test results back, and they are negative. Val tells Ashley that she sponsored Caleb, which causes Ashley to become upset with her mom and Caleb. When he returns to his trailer, Ashley kicks him out. Later, Val is driving along, and pulls over to answer her phone and discover that she needs further tests. Jack gives Tim a loan, since Tim was thinking of selling land to Val to be able to afford to continue after losing his herd of cattle, which would turn Val into Jack's neighbour on both sides. Once they return to Heartland, Amy and Ty get cozy on the couch. He makes Amy say she loves him again, and they kiss.\n |LineColor       = B11030\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2009\u201310)===\n{{Plot|season|date=March 2020}}{{Episode table |background=#006600 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |director=20 |writer=22 |airdate=16 |prodcode=8 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Miracle\n |DirectedBy      = Steve DiMarco\n |WrittenBy       = [[Heather Conkie]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-1\n |ShortSummary    = When a coach bus and a horse trailer collide on Highway 95, they block the route for Amy's school bus to get to her high school. Ignoring a command to stay on the bus, Amy goes to help Caesar, a [[Gray horse|grey]] gelding with Olympic prospects, stuck in a barbed wire fence. Amy calms him down while his trainer, Stuart Forrest, cuts the barbed wire to free him. When Amy turns around, a crowd has gathered to watch, with several individuals filming her. One of these recordings is presented on the news, causing Heartland to become famous overnight. Amy struggles to keep up with the pressure while trying to heal Caesar, who is spooked by loud noises, cars, and horse trailers after the accident. Amy earns the nickname \"Miracle Girl\", which she likes even less than the comments of \"horse whispering\" when people talked about Marion's and her gift previously. Ty applied for a vet program, and accepted an offer from Scott to apprentice/intern with him in the meantime. Ty begins to question his decision after his first job with Scott was to help at the scene of the accident, which included the [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] of a few severely injured horses. Caleb punches Ty for hurting Kit, saying that he had warned him not to. Jack lets Caleb stay in the loft with Ty, as Caleb is living in his truck, unable to get his trailer back from Ashley. She starts working at Maggie's to afford to live on her own. Amy and Ty make plans to get Ashley and Caleb back together, so Ty doesn't have to listen to his snoring. Lisa comes back from France and asks Jack if he misses her when she is away. Jack explains that he misses her, but there's a lot going on at the ranch to occupy his time. Tim buys a new herd of cows with some of the money that Jack lent him. Jack gets upset, but Lisa tells him that he can't tell Tim how to use the loan. Jack asks Val about her deal with Tim, and she says there isn't one. He also asks her how she's feeling, and she says that her doctor says she is in remission, but \"this blood thing's a tricky customer\". This seems to imply that Val had one of the blood cancers ([[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], or [[myeloma]]) which was treated successfully in the time between seasons. Val hasn't told Ashley, not wanting to worry her, and she thanks Jack for taking her to her appointments, saying he is a true friend.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 33\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Little Secrets\n |DirectedBy      = Steve DiMarco\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-2\n |ShortSummary    = Amy finds herself caught in a family crisis when she tries to help a 10-year-old girl, Taylor Kennedy, and her horse Trooper recover from what appears to be a freak accident. Taylor was in a full-body cast after Trooper started galloping apparently out of the blue, and she fell off. Trooper also lunges at Taylor when they first arrive, and Amy notes that she has only seen this with abused horses. Ty thinks it is unlikely that a young girl would abuse her horse, but Mallory cautions that they shouldn't underestimate Taylor. After Amy has been working with Trooper and Taylor together for a while, getting her to spend time with her horse and then grooming him together, she assesses that the horse is fine, and that perhaps the problem lies with Taylor. Amy also finds out that the Kennedys are getting divorced, and that Taylor will go to any lengths to get them to stay together. Taylor also almost hurts Trooper one night while he's in Heartland's care, advancing on him with a large branch in hand, while Mallory looks on. She also gets on and hits him with a riding crop to make him gallop like he did during the accident. Amy stops them before they reach a cliff, but then Taylor starts running. Amy catches her and reveals that she's pieced together the mystery. When they return to the ranch, Amy takes Kate Kennedy aside and tells her that her daughter needs some professional help (Amy says she can help Trooper, but she can't help Taylor). Amy offers to take care of Trooper while Taylor's problems are sorted out, however long that takes. In the meantime, Heartland continues to be very busy thanks to Amy's reputation as the \"Miracle Girl\", meaning that Jack is making extra pens behind the barn to deal with more horses, and Lou and Tim are thinking about expansion plans for the dude ranch. Amy is also treating Roxy, a horse that is barn sour (meaning she is reluctant to leave her stall). Ashley and Caleb continue to be at odds, and Amy brings Soraya into her and Ty's plans to get them back together. The two girls talk to Ashley, but she has figured out what they are up to (and why), and asks them to stay out of it. Lou continues to try to keep Amy's schedule manageable, but Tim continues to interfere, promising service to people that Lou says will have to wait.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 34\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Man's Best Friend\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Conkie\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|18}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-3\n |ShortSummary    = Jack's truck breaks down more and more often, causing Lisa and him to miss a wedding they were supposed to go to. Lisa and the rest of the family try to convince him to upgrade. They persuade him to visit the Chevy dealership, and he comes home with a new grey Silverado, after trading in his old truck for $1000. However, he continues to complain about the truck, its seat settings, its lack of comfort, etc. He becomes upset, and takes the truck up to the fishing cabin. The family can't understand why Jack is so attached to his old truck, but the audience learns through a flashback sequence that Jack's late wife, Amy and Lou's grandmother, Lyndy bought him the 1972 Chevrolet Cheyenne 10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gyy7WyFtazEC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22totally+tougher+to+last+longer%22&source=bl&ots=M_NWJi3uMD&sig=Ov2wy9rvpok-K7XGjUgzyeogrN0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi33b3l3fvVAhWnhlQKHYZKBKIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Field & Stream|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|via=Google Books}}</ref> as an anniversary gift early in their marriage. In the meantime, Amy is trying to help a horse named Duke, whose stable-mate died recently, by trying to get him to bond with Pegasus. Mallory and Jake stop by, looking for Kramer, Jake's black-and-white paint cow pony, who has a habit of escaping from pens by jumping the fences. When they find him, they ask Amy to solve his problem. Amy recognizes that the horse actually jumps fences without provocation, simply because he loves to jump. Amy's solution is for Mallory to take Kramer around a jumping course regularly, to keep his extra energy in check and make him behave for Jake's family. Kramer also helps Amy with Duke, because the two horses become fast friends. She is then able to get Duke to socialize with the other horses and to get over his grief. The end-of-school dance is also coming up fast, and Amy and Ty are supposed to go together. Amy was going to use one of Lou's old dresses, but Lisa gives her a beautiful turquoise gown from Paris. Ty is worried because he doesn't know how to dance, so he takes lessons from Lou (and Peter, who's back from a business trip to Dubai). Amy and Ty head out to their dance, but Ty's truck breaks down. Instead, they wind up dancing in the bed of the truck, and Ty presents Amy with a promise ring. Ashley asks a rich boy from a private school to go with her as a date to the dance to make Caleb jealous. Caleb hitches his trailer to his truck, and tries to pull it away, but he and Ashley wind up laughing about it before she drives off with the other boy. Jack's problems with the new truck are solved when he finds a used truck, much like his old one, but in much better shape. Old Goldie (the old truck) is brought back to the farm as a \"lawn ornament\" and sits beside another old, dead truck.\n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 35\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = The Haunting of Hanley Barn\n |DirectedBy      = Dean Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Haroun\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|25}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-4\n |ShortSummary    = Something is scaring the horses at night in the Hanley Barn and Amy is called in to investigate. At first, Amy thinks it might be the feed, but Mr. Hanley rejects this suggestion as he'd already talked about it with the vet. Amy agrees to come back that night to investigate further, and Ty comes with her at Jack's request. Meanwhile, Badger returns to Heartland, having run away from his foster home to see his birth parents, but they had moved without leaving him any contact information. He talks to Ty about it, saying that he needs somewhere to stay overnight. Ty lets him stay temporarily, and Mallory finds Badger sketching by the lake. Both seem interested in each other, as Badger almost tells Mallory she looks more grown-up than before, and Mallory asks about Tara, who Badger seemed to be dating when they first showed up in Season 2. Clint stops by looking for Badger, and Ty pretends he hasn't seen him, to give Badger some time to cool off before having to return to his foster home. Mallory steals food for Badger, and the story returns to Amy. She and Ty are at Maggie's, and Ty asks why everyone thinks the barn is haunted. Soraya, Amy, Ashley, and Mallory recount the tale: A young man was working at the Hanley place, and fell in love with the farmer's daughter. One night, the barn erupted into flame and all the horses, as well as the young man, died in the fire. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hanley's parents bought the farm from the previous owners and they built a new barn on top of the original's location. Now it is believed that The Drifter, the young man, haunts the barn, and he is portrayed as wearing a black cloak, with a hook for a hand, and no face under his hood. Just then, Caleb bangs in, wearing a heavy black cloak because the weather's turning. Amy and Ty go to the Hanley place, and spend several hours just playing cards. While they are there, Caleb, Soraya, and Ashley show up to scare them (in which they succeed). Noises come from upstairs, which Amy had noticed earlier in the day. Amy and Ty investigate, despite Mr. Hanley's previous warning that the loft is strictly off-limits. They discover Mallory and Badger upstairs, and tell them to go home. At this point, Mr. Hanley appears and explains that the loft has dry rot, which is why he told Amy not to go upstairs. In the end, Amy discovers that Mr. Hanley's neighbour, Brett, has been spiking the horses' feed with a [[carbohydrate loading|glycogen loader]], meant to give horses energy, which is the reason they are so worked up in the morning. He wants to force Mr. Hanley into foreclosure, so he can buy the land. Once that problem's solved, Ty decides to help Badger by coaching him through how to apologize to Clint, which Badger does. Ty also tells Badger to come back to Heartland if he runs away again, so that he'll be safe. Later, Mallory flips through Badger's sketchpad while he's not around and sees a drawing of her. She asks him about it, and they wind up kissing. Lou is planning on visiting Peter in Denver, Colorado, for a single day while he has a layover on his way back to Dubai. Jack disapproves, and says it's an awful long distance to travel for a single day together. Lou can't understand why he's so easy on Amy and hard on her, but Jack eventually reveals it's because Amy reminds him so much of Marion, and Lou reminds him of himself. He also says that he worries about when she'll leave again, possibly for New York, or ''worse'' (in his eyes), Toronto. Mrs. Bell comes over to use the kitchen to make strawberry jam with Lou's help. While she's there, Mrs. Bell reminisces, and tells Mallory, about Thomas Ritter (aka The Drifter), her first boyfriend. She gave him a jar of jam, and he returned the empty jar with a butterfly in it. Towards the end of the episode, Mrs. Bell brings a butterfly in a jar to the grave at the Hanley farm where he was buried, and releases it in his memory. \n |LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 36\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Glory Days\n |DirectedBy      = [[Don McBrearty]]\n |WrittenBy       = Leila Basen and David Preston\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|11|1}}\n |ProdCode        = 159251-5\n |ShortSummary    = In the hopes of impressing Ashley, Caleb takes lessons in [[Steer wrestling|bulldogging]] from former rodeo champion Tim, who considers getting back into competition, and refuses to acknowledge that he may no longer have what it takes. Amy helps them with this. Tim pays Jack back for his loan in cows, and Jack relives his glory days as well, working with the cattle herd. He realizes he can't do it alone, and gets Tim's help, ''for a price''. Tim wants a paycheque and grazing fees, meaning the herd of cattle might not be much of a return of the loan. Kit's barrel horse is foaling, and Ty helps Scott check on the mare while waiting for her time to come. They talk, and Kit congratulates him on getting accepted to two pre-vet university programs (at the [[University of Manitoba]], and Grasslands Agricultural College). Kit says she knew he could do it, though he struggled with Grade 12 Algebra. (This is another regional error: she means Math 30 Pure, as Alberta's high school maths are broken down only into Pure (university prep)/Applied (college prep) and Math 31 (calculus), not into algebra, geometry, etc., like some other provinces.) Ty assists Scott with the delivery, which is complicated by the fact that the foal is upside down. Its head and right foreleg get stuck while Scott tries to turn it, and the foal is [[stillborn]]. Kit and Ty sort out their lingering break-up issues while Ty comforts Kit, who is visibly upset. After the birth, the mare refuses to leave the dead foal alone, so they try to get her to bond with an orphaned foal, Merlin, instead. It's hard going at first, but Amy comes over to help and rubs the foal with the blanket that was on the dead foal, making him smell like the mare's foal. At that point, the mare accepts Merlin and he's able to nurse, which seems to be a success. Lou invites Peter to manage his business from the Heartland facilities while his office in Calgary undergoes renovation, which soon turns out to be a mistake. Peter also interferes with Lou and Mallory's agreement for Copper, telling Mallory that she has actually completely paid off her share of Copper's ownership, and then some. Caleb repays Val for her sponsorship, and he talks about his reasons for trying bulldogging. He thinks it will be safer, but Tim later tells him that it's even more dangerous than bronc riding, because there are more variables with more animals. Val tells Ashley that Caleb's a good guy, and tells her that the money was repaid. Val asks Ashley to forgive her and give her a second chance and Ashley moves back to Briar Ridge.

Lou arranges a meeting for Peter with a famously wealthy and eco-minded oil billionaire Richard Chenoweth at the Heartland facilities. Something about Richard seems off whenever Peter is out of earshot. The local wildlife official warns Jack about a cougar in the area. The cougar's presence in Heartland is unmistakable, eventually causing Richard to fall off his horse during a trail ride with Lou and Peter. After Peter comes to Lou's defense following unwanted advances from Richard, Lou must defuse a threatened lawsuit from the unscrupulous businessman. Lou is successful and in a most satisfying manner. Meanwhile, Val is trying  too hard to reconnect with her newly reconciled daughter Ashley and Ashley is feeling suffocated.

Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber.

Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber.

As a native of Lviv, even after the war she felt a bond with the city of her childhood and youth, which she would reveal later in her work. She studied [[Classics|classical philology]] and graduated in [[romance studies]] at the  [[University of Lviv]]. Knowledge of Greek and Latin, German, and especially fluent knowledge of French, which she mastered with confidence, along with a lively and absorbent intellectual sensitivity, allowed her to read in the original the works of the classics, and also to closely follow modern [[Western culture]].\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn 1924, Anna Chrzanowska's married her professor, Jerzy Kowalski, classical philologist at the University of Lviv, who was 10 years older than her. In the interwar period, they traveled a lot around Europe: they visited, among others, [[Italy]], [[Paris]], [[Lausanne]] (where Kowalska attended lectures in Latin literature), [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (where she also listened to university lectures). In 1946, their daughter Maria, called Tula at home, was born in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. Kowalska joined the literary life of interwar Lviv, cooperated with the Sygna\u0142y weekly and the Przedmie\u015bcie literary group. In 1936, she co-organized the Congress of Culture Workers.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the Kowalski family remained in Soviet Lviv: Jerzy continued lecturing at the university, Anna was a witness of political repressions (her brother was imprisoned, and her sister-in-law was [[Great Purge|deported to Siberia]] by [[Russians]]). In 1943, they moved to Warsaw where Kowalska joined the underground resistance. She was in the city during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].\n\nIn 1945, Anna moved with her husband to [[Wroc\u0142aw]] where Jerzy Kowalski organized classical philology at the [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]. They settled in [[Kar\u0142owice]], in a villa at Samuel Bogumi\u0142 Linde Street 10. After the death of her husband (he died of cancer in 1948) Kowalska remained in Wroc\u0142aw. \n\n=== After World War II ===\nAnna participated in the literary and intellectual life of Wroc\u0142aw, and from 1947 to 1952, she was a co-editor of the quarterly \"Zeszyty Wroc\u0142awskie\". A room in the house at Linde Street was rented by [[Czes\u0142aw Hernas]], then a student of Polish studies and a close friend of Kowalska and [[Maria D\u0105browska]].\n\nIn 1954, Anna Kowalska moved to Warsaw and lived together with her daughter and Maria D\u0105browska (in a spacious apartment in a pre-war tenement house at Aleja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci). In 1963, they went together to Italy, [[Switzerland]] and Paris - visiting, among others [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Jerzy Stempowski]].

As a native of Lviv, even after the war she felt a bond with the city of her childhood and youth, which she would reveal later in her work. She studied [[Classics|classical philology]] and graduated in [[romance studies]] at the  [[University of Lviv]]. Knowledge of Greek and Latin, German, and especially fluent knowledge of French, which she mastered with confidence, along with a lively and absorbent intellectual sensitivity, allowed her to read in the original the works of the classics, and also to closely follow modern [[Western culture]].\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn 1924, Anna Chrzanowska's married her professor, Jerzy Kowalski, classical philologist at the University of Lviv, who was 10 years older than her. In the interwar period, they traveled a lot around Europe: they visited, among others, [[Italy]], [[Paris]], [[Lausanne]] (where Kowalska attended lectures in Latin literature), [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (where she also listened to university lectures). In 1946, their daughter Maria, called Tula at home, was born in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. Kowalska joined the literary life of interwar Lviv, cooperated with the Sygna\u0142y weekly and the Przedmie\u015bcie literary group. In 1936, she co-organized the Congress of Culture Workers.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the Kowalski family remained in Soviet Lviv: Jerzy continued lecturing at the university, Anna was a witness of political repressions (her brother was imprisoned, and her sister-in-law was [[Great Purge|deported to Siberia]] by [[Russians]]). In 1943, they moved to Warsaw where Kowalska joined the underground resistance. She was in the city during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].\n\nIn 1945, Anna moved with her husband to [[Wroc\u0142aw]] where Jerzy Kowalski organized classical philology at the [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]. They settled in [[Kar\u0142owice]], in a villa at Samuel Bogumi\u0142 Linde Street 10. After the death of her husband (he died of cancer in 1948) Kowalska remained in Wroc\u0142aw. \n\n=== After World War II ===\nAnna participated in the literary and intellectual life of Wroc\u0142aw, and from 1947 to 1952, she was a co-editor of the quarterly \"Zeszyty Wroc\u0142awskie\". A room in the house at Linde Street was rented by [[Czes\u0142aw Hernas]], then a student of Polish studies and a close friend of Kowalska and [[Maria D\u0105browska]].\n\nIn 1954, Anna Kowalska moved to Warsaw and lived together with her daughter and Maria D\u0105browska (in a spacious apartment in a pre-war tenement house at Aleja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci). In 1963, they went together to Italy, [[Switzerland]] and Paris - visiting, among others [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Jerzy Stempowski]]. She participated in the literary life of the capital, belonging to ZLP and [[Pen Club]].

{"title_page": "Soviet-type economic planning", "text_new": "{{systemic bias|1=Soviet-type economic planning|bias=capitalism|date=February 2017}}\n{{missing|similarities and differences of Soviet-style planning in Eastern Bloc countries outside the Soviet Union|date=March 2019}}\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|concepts}}\n'''Soviet-type economic planning''' ('''STP''') is the specific model of [[centralized planning]] employed by [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[socialist state]]s modeled on the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy]] of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR). Although there was significant variation among these economies, Soviet-type planning and Soviet-type economies refers to the major structural characteristics common to these economies.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\">{{cite book|last1=Gentry|first1=Sammy|last2=Rogers|first2=Spencer|year=2008|title=Economic Development and Planning|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nSoviet-type planning is a form of economic planning involving [[centralized]] investment decisions, administrative allocation of economic inputs, [[Material balance planning|material balances]] to reach equilibrium between available inputs and targeted outputs, and to some extent the use of [[linear optimization]] to optimize the plans.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\"/>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Institutions ===\nThe major institutions of Soviet-type planning in the USSR included a planning agency ([[Gosplan]]), an organization for allocating state supplies among the various organizations and enterprises in the economy ([[Gossnab]]) and [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]] which were engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services in the economy. Enterprises comprised production associations and institutes that were linked together by the plans formulated by Gosplan.\n\n=== Material balances ===\n{{main|Material balance planning}}\nMaterial balance planning was the major function of Gosplan in the USSR. This method of planning involved the accounting of material supplies in natural units (as opposed to monetary terms) which are used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of available inputs and raw [[materials]] in the economy and then using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for the national economy.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. \"Material Balance Planning\", (P.127)</ref>\n\n== Analysis of Soviet-type planning ==\n{{economic systems sidebar|by regional model}}\nThere are two fundamental ways scholars have carried out an analysis of Soviet-type economic planning. The first involves adapting standard [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic models and theories to analyze the Soviet economic system. This paradigm stresses the importance of [[Pareto efficiency]] standard.<ref name=Rosefielde>{{cite book |last=Rosefielde|first=Steven|title=The Russian Economy: From Lenin to Putin|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=9}}</ref> In contrast to this approach, scholars such as Pawel Dembinski argue that neoclassical tools are somewhat inappropriate for evaluating Soviet-type planning because they attempt to quantify and measure phenomena specific to capitalist-based economies.<ref name=Dembinski>{{cite book |last=Dembinski|first=Pawel H.|title=The Logic of the Planned Economy: The Seeds of the Collapse|year=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> They contend that because standard economic models rely on assumptions not fulfilled in the Soviet system (especially the [[Rational choice theory|assumption of economic rationality]] underlying decision-making), the results obtained from a neoclassical analysis will distort the actual effects of STP. These other scholars proceed along a different course by trying to engage with STP on its own terms, investigating the philosophical, historical and political influences that gave rise to STP whilst evaluating its economic successes and failures (theoretical and actual) with reference to those contexts.\n\nThe USSR practiced some form of [[central planning]] beginning in 1918 with [[War Communism]] until it dissolved in 1991, although the type and extent of planning was of a different nature before imperative [[centralized planning]] was introduced in the 1930s. While there were many subtleties to the various forms of economic organization the USSR employed during this 70-year time period, enough features were shared that scholars have broadly examined advantages and disadvantages of Soviet-type economic planning. Soviet is not the same as [[economic planning]] in general as there are other theoretical models of economic planning and modern [[mixed economies]] also practice economic planning to a certain extent, but they are not subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages enumerated here.\n\n=== Advantages ===\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, the advantages of STP are quite limited. One advantage of STP is the theoretical possibility to avoid [[inflation]].<ref name=Jeffries>{{cite book |last=Jeffries|first=Ian|title=A Guide to the Socialist Economies|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|pages=8}}</ref> Complete price stability is achievable, not only because the state plans all prices and quantities, but also because the state has complete control over the [[money supply]] via the wages it pays as the sole employer. To maintain a fixed currency value, all the state must do is balance the total value of goods available during a given planning period with the amount of wages it pays according to the following equation,<ref>Jeffries, 16.</ref> where <math>P</math> represents the general retail price level, <math>Q</math> accounts for the quantity of consumer goods and services, <math>Y</math> is total household income (wages paid), <math>\\mathit{TP}</math> is [[transfer payments]], <math>S</math> is household saving, and <math>T</math> is direct household taxes:\n<math display=block>P\\times Q=Y+\\mathit{TP}-S-T</math>\n\nHowever, the USSR arguably never realized this theoretical possibility.<ref>Jeffries, 16-17.</ref> It suffered from both open and repressed inflation throughout much of its history because of failure to balance the above equation.\n\nAnother advantage of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective is the ability to eliminate [[unemployment]] (with the exception of [[frictional unemployment]]) and [[business cycles]].<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\">Jeffries, 12.</ref> Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930,<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\"/> although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that although workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat idle because of capital deficiencies, i.e. there was employed unemployment.<ref>Rosefield, 19.</ref>\n\nThose scholars who reject the neoclassical viewpoint consider the benefits of STP that the USSR itself adduced. One is the ability to control for [[externalities]] directly in the pricing mechanism.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\">Dembinski, 70.</ref> Another is the total capture of value obtained in STP which is neglected in market economies.<ref>Dembinski, 69.</ref> By this, it is meant that while a worker might put in a certain amount of work to produce a good, a market might value that good at less than the cost of labor the worker put in, effectively negating the value of the work done. Because in STP prices are set by the state, STP avoids this pitfall by never pricing an item below its labor value. While these do seem to be valid theoretical advantages to STP (especially under a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] framework), it has been argued by some that STP as implemented by the USSR failed to achieve these theoretical possibilities.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\"/>\n\nIt is claimed that centrally-planned economies also provide a better quality of life than market economies at the same level of economic development in nearly all cases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cereseto|first=Shirley|date=June 1986|title=Economic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume= 76|issue=6|pages=661\u2013666|pmc=1646771|pmid=3706593|doi=10.2105/ajph.76.6.661}}</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\n{{POV section|date=December 2017}}\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, there were many disadvantages to STP. They can be divided into two categories: [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]].\n\nMacroeconomic disadvantages included systemic [[undersupply]], the pursuit of [[full employment]] at a steep cost, price fixing's devastating effect on agricultural [[incentives]] and the loss of the advantages of [[money]] because STP eschews money's classic role.<ref>Rosefielde, 19. Jeffries 7, 15, 19.</ref> Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of [[material balances]] (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs) which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough [[perfect information|information]] to craft them accurately.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR.<ref name=\"Jeffries, 15\">Jeffries, 15.</ref> This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. There was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically with the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.<ref>Rosefielde, 19.</ref>\n\nThe microeconomic disadvantages from a neoclassical perspective include the following:<ref>Jeffries, 8, 13-15, 22.</ref> \n* Encouragement of [[black-market]] activity because of fixed resource allocation.\n* Low quality of Soviet goods induced by [[Trade barrier|shielding]] them from world markets.\n* The neglect of consumer need because of the challenge in measuring good quality.\n* The tendency of enterprise-level Soviet managers to understate productive capacity in fear of the [[ratchet effect]].

Although there was significant variation among these economies, Soviet-type planning and Soviet-type economies refers to the major structural characteristics common to these economies.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\">{{cite book|last1=Gentry|first1=Sammy|last2=Rogers|first2=Spencer|year=2008|title=Economic Development and Planning|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nSoviet-type planning is a form of economic planning involving [[centralized]] investment decisions, administrative allocation of economic inputs, [[Material balance planning|material balances]] to reach equilibrium between available inputs and targeted outputs, and to some extent the use of [[linear optimization]] to optimize the plans.<ref name=\"Gentry & Rogers 2008\"/>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Institutions ===\nThe major institutions of Soviet-type planning in the Soviet Union included a planning agency ([[Gosplan]]), an organization for allocating state supplies among the various organizations and enterprises in the economy ([[Gossnab]]), and [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]] which were engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services in the economy. Enterprises comprised production associations and institutes that were linked together by the plans formulated by Gosplan.\n\n=== Material balances ===\n{{main|Material balance planning}}\nMaterial balance planning was the major function of Gosplan in the Soviet Union. This method of planning involved the accounting of material supplies in natural units (as opposed to monetary terms), which are used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of available inputs and raw [[materials]] in the economy and then using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for the national economy.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. \"Material Balance Planning\", (P.127)</ref>\n\n== Analysis of Soviet-type planning ==\n{{economic systems sidebar|by model}}\nThere are two fundamental ways scholars have carried out an analysis of Soviet-type economic planning. The first involves adapting standard [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic models and theories to analyze the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economic system]]. This paradigm stresses the importance of [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficiency standard]].<ref name=Rosefielde>{{cite book |last=Rosefielde|first=Steven|title=The Russian Economy: From Lenin to Putin|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=9}}</ref> In contrast to this approach, scholars like Pawel Dembinski argue that neo-classical tools are somewhat inappropriate for evaluating Soviet-type planning because they attempt to quantify and measure phenomena specific to capitalist-based economies.<ref name=Dembinski>{{cite book |last=Dembinski|first=Pawel H.|title=The Logic of the Planned Economy: The Seeds of the Collapse|year=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> They contend that, because standard economic models rely on assumptions not fulfilled in the Soviet system (especially the [[Rational choice theory|assumption of economic rationality]] underlying decision-making), the results obtained from a neo-classical analysis will distort the actual effects of STP. These other scholars proceed along a different course, trying to engage with STP on its own terms, investigating the philosophical, historical, and political influences that gave rise to STP, and evaluating its economic successes and failures (theoretical and actual) with reference to those contexts.\n\nThe USSR practiced some form of [[central planning]] beginning in 1918 with [[War Communism]] until it dissolved in 1991, although the type and extent of planning was of a different nature before imperative [[centralized planning]] was introduced in the 1930s. While there were many subtleties to the various forms of economic organization the USSR employed during this 70-year time period, enough features were shared that scholars have broadly examined advantages and disadvantages of Soviet-type economic planning. Soviet is not the same as [[economic planning]] in general \u2013 there are other theoretical models of economic planning, and modern [[mixed economies]] also practice economic planning to a certain extent, but they are not subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages enumerated here.\n\n=== Advantages ===\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, the advantages of STP are quite limited. One advantage of STP is the theoretical possibility to avoid [[inflation]].<ref name=Jeffries>{{cite book |last=Jeffries|first=Ian|title=A Guide to the Socialist Economies|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|pages=8}}</ref> Complete price stability is achievable, not only because the state plans all prices and quantities, but also because the state has complete control over the [[money supply]] via the wages it pays as the sole employer. Therefore, to maintain a fixed currency value, all the state must do is balance the total value of goods available during a given planning period with the amount of wages it pays according to the following equation,<ref>Jeffries, 16.</ref> where <math>P</math> represents the general retail price level, <math>Q</math> accounts for the quantity of consumer goods and services, <math>Y</math> is total household income (wages paid), <math>\\mathit{TP}</math> is [[transfer payments]], <math>S</math> is household saving, and <math>T</math> is direct household taxes:\n<math display=block>P\\times Q=Y+\\mathit{TP}-S-T</math>\n\nHowever, the USSR arguably never realized this theoretical possibility.<ref>Jeffries, 16-17.</ref> It suffered from both open and repressed inflation throughout much of its history because of failure to balance the above equation.\n\nAnother advantage of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective is the ability to eliminate [[unemployment]] (with the exception of [[frictional unemployment]]) and [[business cycles]].<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\">Jeffries, 12.</ref> Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Also, because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930,<ref name=\"Jeffries, 12\"/> although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that though workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat idle because of capital deficiencies; ''i.e.'', there was employed unemployment.<ref>Rosefield, 19.</ref>\n\nThose scholars who reject the neoclassical viewpoint consider the benefits of STP that the USSR itself adduced. One is the ability to control for [[externalities]] directly in the pricing mechanism.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\">Dembinski, 70.</ref> Another is the total capture of value obtained in STP which is neglected in market economies.<ref>Dembinski, 69.</ref> By this it is meant that while a worker might put in a certain amount of work to produce a good, a market might value that good at less than the cost of labor the worker put in, effectively negating the value of the work done. But, because in STP prices are set by the state, STP avoids this pitfall by never pricing an item below its labor value. While these do seem to be valid theoretical advantages to STP (especially under a [[Marxist]] framework), it has been argued by some that STP as implemented by the USSR failed to achieve these theoretical possibilities.<ref name=\"Dembinski, 70\"/>\n\nIt is claimed that centrally-planned economies also provide a better quality of life than market economies at the same level of economic development in nearly all cases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cereseto|first=Shirley|date=June 1986|title=Economic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume= 76|issue=6|pages=661\u2013666|pmc=1646771|pmid=3706593|doi=10.2105/ajph.76.6.661}}</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\n{{POV section|date=December 2017}}\nFrom a neoclassical perspective, there were many disadvantages to STP. They can be divided into two categories: [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]].\n\nMacroeconomic disadvantages included systemic [[undersupply]], the pursuit of [[full employment]] at a steep cost, price fixing's devastating effect on agricultural [[incentives]], and the loss of the [[Money|advantages of money]] because STP eschews money's classic role.<ref>Rosefielde, 19. Jeffries 7, 15, 19.</ref> Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of \"[[material balances]]\" (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs), which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough [[perfect information|information]] to craft them accurately{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR.<ref name=\"Jeffries, 15\">Jeffries, 15.</ref> This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. Therefore, there was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically, the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.<ref>Rosefielde, 19.</ref>\n\nThe microeconomic disadvantages from a neoclassical perspective include:<ref>Jeffries, 8, 13-15, 22.</ref> \n* Encouragement of [[Black market|black-market activity]] because of fixed resource allocation\n* Low quality of Soviet goods induced by [[Trade barrier|shielding]] them from world markets \n* The neglect of consumer need because of the challenge in measuring good quality \n* The tendency of enterprise-level Soviet managers to understate productive capacity in fear of the \"[[ratchet effect]]\". This effect resulted from an enterprise overproducing in a given plan cycle. They would have to match their new level of higher production in the next cycle as the plan was \"adjusted\" to fit the new data.\n* An anti-innovation bias (also from fear of the [[ratchet effect]])\n* \"Storming\" (''[[shturmovshchina]]'') which was the hurry to complete the plan at the end of a planning cycle resulting in poor production quality\n* \"Scattering\" of resources (excessive spread, ''raspylenie sredstv''), where too many projects (esp. construction) would have been started simultaneously and it took much longer to complete because of a lack of available inputs on time\n\nScholars who reject the neoclassical approach produce a shorter list of disadvantages, but because these disadvantages are valid even from the Soviet perspective, they are perhaps even more damning of STP than those listed above. These scholars consider STP's inability to predict things like weather, trade, and technological advancement as an insurmountable drawback to the planning procedure.<ref>Dembinski, 71.</ref> Without exhaustive knowledge of those things, planning would (and did) systemically misappropriate resources{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Also, STP's use of coercive techniques (e.g. ratchet effect, [[Gulag|labor camps]], etc.), which are argued to be inherent to STP, on the one hand ensured the system's survival and on the other hand resulted in the [[information asymmetry|distorted information]] that made effective planning challenging if not impossible.<ref>Dembinski, 76, 80.</ref> And lastly these scholars argue that the semantic limitations of language made it impossible for STP planners to communicate their desires to enterprises in sufficient detail for planning to fully direct economic outcomes.<ref>Dembinski, 81.</ref> Enterprises themselves under STP still made a variety of economic decisions autonomously.\n\nOther scholars have argued following the collapse of the USSR argued that a central deficiency of Soviet economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, and that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, E. 1986.

of the [[Mascarene Islands]] which include Mauritius and [[R\u00e9union]]. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by [[coral reef]], and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth [[District of Mauritius]]; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is [[Port Mathurin]].\n\nIts inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. {{As of|2014}}, the island's population was about 41,669, according to [[Statistics Mauritius]].<ref name=\"stats2012\"/> Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and European descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\nThe island (together with [[Agal\u00e9ga]] and [[Saint Brandon]]) forms part of the larger territory of the Republic of Mauritius with the [[President of Mauritius|President]] as head of state and the [[Chief Commissioner of Rodrigues|Chief Commissioner]] as head of government.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n{{See also|History of Mauritius}}\n[[File:DIOGO RODRIGUES Painting in GOA Records.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rodrigues was named after [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]], who first came upon the uninhabited island in 1528, under direction of Portuguese Viceroy [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (namesake of the [[Mascarene Islands]]).]]\nThe uninhabited island was named after the Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Rodrigues]] in February 1528. Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz.  From the 10th century, [[Arabs]] have been known to visit the [[Mascarene Islands]]. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi]]{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} supposedly contains them, and the [[Cantino planisphere]] of {{circa|1500}} and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as ''Dina Arobi'' (or ''Harobi''), ''Dina Margabin'' and ''Dina Moraze''. These are apparently corrupted [[transliteration]]s or transcriptions of the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''Diva Harab'' (\"Desert Island\"), {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0646}} ''Diva Maghrebin'' (\"Western Island\") and {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0642}} ''Diva Mashriq'' (\"Eastern Island\"). While the second clearly refers to [[R\u00e9union]], sources disagree about which of the other is [[Mauritius]] and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of R\u00e9union and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some [[karst]], while Mauritius even after suffering 500 years of [[deforestation]] can by no means be called \"desert\" even in a colloquial sense.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arabs|url=http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Mauritiana|accessdate=6 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501213112/http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe island was located again in February 1507.

The other two islands were subsequently rediscovered. The initial name was ''Diogo Fernandes''; ''Domingo Froiz'' was given as a name some years later, and by 1528 it had been again renamed after the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[navigator]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]] and has remained so since. The [[orthography]] has been less stable at first, with the name being [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''Diogo Rodr\u00edguez'' (Spanish maps), ''Diego Roiz'', ''Diego Ruys'' (Dutch maps) (or even ''Diego Ruy's Island''), ''Dygarroys'' or ''Bygarroys''. Some early French sources called it ''\u00cele Marianne''.\n\nDue to the island lying far off the beaten track of seafarers at that time, it received few visits. From 1601, the Dutch began visiting the island somewhat more regularly for fresh supplies of food. In 1691, the [[Huguenot]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]] and seven companions landed on the island, intending to set up a farming colony of [[Protestant]] refugees. Farming was not successful, but there was an abundance of tortoises, turtles, birds, fish and other seafood.\n\nDuring the 18th century several attempts were made by the French to develop the island. African [[slavery|slaves]] (ancestors of the present population) were brought to Rodrigues to develop stock-breeding and farming. In 1735 a permanent French settlement was established, subordinated to [[R\u00e9union|\u00cele Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm#Rodrigues|title=Mauritius|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1809, after a brief battle with the French, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops took possession of Rodrigues.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin.|title=British Battles and Medals.|page=30.

Formerly captained solo by professor Leonid Lysenko for the Russian [[Maritime State University]] as a research ship, the vessel's mast and rudder broke on a voyage in 1995, drifting for 21 days until Lysenko was rescued by the crew of the Ukrainian vessel ''Arkaja'', at which time the ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was abandoned. Lysenko was certain that the ship would eventually sink; however, the vessel continued to drift at sea without crew for over 2 years before finally washing up on Rodrigues, at which time it was removed from the water and brought ashore. In 2010, Russian Hon. Eric Typhis Degtyarenko located the yacht and contacted the Maritime State University, at which time the ship was converted to a [[maritime museum]] in recognition as Russia's only link to the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=2150554|title=Admiral Nevelskoi - ShipSpotting.com - Ship Photos and Ship Tracker|website=www.shipspotting.com|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rodrigues CalcareniticShore.jpg|thumb|Calcarenitic shore of Rodrigues island, at Pointe Coton]]\nRodrigues is a [[volcanic island]] rising from a ridge along the edge of the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

There are local competitions almost throughout the year and in specific competitions, the winning team travels to Mauritius for sport exchange. [[Volleyball]] is also popular. There is also a public [[swimming pool]] at Marechal, a village located in the center of the island, and a [[stadium]] at Camp Du Rois in the region of [[Port Mathurin]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\n ================================== ({{NoMoreLinks}}) ==================================\n DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

of the [[Mascarene Islands]] which include Mauritius and [[R\u00e9union]]. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by [[coral reef]], and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth [[District of Mauritius]]; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is [[Port Mathurin]].\n\nIts inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. {{As of|2014}}, the island's population was about 41,669, according to [[Statistics Mauritius]].<ref name=\"stats2012\"/> Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and European descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\nThe island (together with [[Agal\u00e9ga]] and [[Saint Brandon]]) forms part of the larger territory of the Republic of Mauritius with the [[President of Mauritius|President]] as head of state and the [[Chief Commissioner of Rodrigues|Chief Commissioner]] as head of government.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n{{See also|History of Mauritius}}\n[[File:DIOGO RODRIGUES Painting in GOA Records.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rodrigues was named after [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]], who first came upon the uninhabited island in 1528, under direction of Portuguese Viceroy [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (namesake of the [[Mascarene Islands]]).]]\nThe uninhabited island was named after the Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Rodrigues]] in February 1528. Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz.  From the 10th century, [[Arabs]] have been known to visit the [[Mascarene Islands]]. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi]]{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} supposedly contains them, and the [[Cantino planisphere]] of {{circa|1500}} and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as ''Dina Arobi'' (or ''Harobi''), ''Dina Margabin'' and ''Dina Moraze''. These are apparently corrupted [[transliteration]]s or transcriptions of the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''Diva Harab'' (\"Desert Island\"), {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0646}} ''Diva Maghrebin'' (\"Western Island\") and {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0642}} ''Diva Mashriq'' (\"Eastern Island\"). While the second clearly refers to [[R\u00e9union]], sources disagree about which of the other is [[Mauritius]] and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of R\u00e9union and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some [[karst]], while Mauritius even after suffering 500 years of [[deforestation]] can by no means be called \"desert\" even in a colloquial sense.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arabs|url=http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Mauritiana|accessdate=6 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501213112/http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe island was located again in February 1507. Part of the fleet of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] and [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]]'s ''Cirne''{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}<!-- correct transciption? \"Cern\u00e9\"? --> spotted R\u00e9union on 9 February after a [[cyclone]] diverted their<!-- deliberately ambiguous&nbsp;\u2014 not clear whether only \"Cirne\" was diverted --> course. The other two islands were subsequently rediscovered. The initial name was ''Diogo Fernandes''; ''Domingo Froiz'' was given as a name some years later, and by 1528 it had been again renamed after the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[navigator]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]] and has remained so since. The [[orthography]] has been less stable at first, with the name being [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''Diogo Rodr\u00edguez'' (Spanish maps), ''Diego Roiz'', ''Diego Ruys'' (Dutch maps) (or even ''Diego Ruy's Island''), ''Dygarroys'' or ''Bygarroys''. Some early French sources called it ''\u00cele Marianne''.\n\nDue to the island lying far off the beaten track of seafarers at that time, it received few visits. From 1601, the Dutch began visiting the island somewhat more regularly for fresh supplies of food. In 1691, the [[Huguenot]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]] and seven companions landed on the island, intending to set up a farming colony of [[Protestant]] refugees. Farming was not successful, but there was an abundance of tortoises, turtles, birds, fish and other seafood.\n\nDuring the 18th century several attempts were made by the French to develop the island. African [[slavery|slaves]] (ancestors of the present population) were brought to Rodrigues to develop stock-breeding and farming. In 1735 a permanent French settlement was established, subordinated to [[R\u00e9union|\u00cele Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm#Rodrigues|title=Mauritius|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1809, after a brief battle with the French, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops took possession of Rodrigues.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin.|title=British Battles and Medals.|page=30.

Having been heard from about {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} away on the other side of the Indian Ocean, the noise remains the loudest sound in recorded history.\n\nIn 1968, Rodrigues was joined with [[Mauritius]] when it attained independence; in 2002 when it became an autonomous region of Mauritius, the island was made the seat of the Roman Catholic [[Vicariate Apostolic of Rodrigues]].\n\nIn 1997, the {{convert|40|ft|m|sp=us|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} Russian yacht ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was found in the lagoon of [[Rodrigues Island]]. Formerly captained solo by professor Leonid Lysenko for the Russian [[Maritime State University]] as a research ship, the vessel's mast and rudder broke on a voyage in 1995, drifting for 21 days until Lysenko was rescued by the crew of the Ukrainian vessel ''Arkaja'', at which time the ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was abandoned. Lysenko was certain that the ship would eventually sink; however, the vessel continued to drift at sea without crew for over 2 years before finally washing up on Rodrigues, at which time it was removed from the water and brought ashore. In 2010, Russian Hon. Eric Typhis Degtyarenko located the yacht and contacted the Maritime State University, at which time the ship was converted to a [[maritime museum]] in recognition as Russia's only link to the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=2150554|title=Admiral Nevelskoi - ShipSpotting.com - Ship Photos and Ship Tracker|website=www.shipspotting.com|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rodrigues CalcareniticShore.jpg|thumb|Calcarenitic shore of Rodrigues island, at Pointe Coton]]\nRodrigues is a [[volcanic island]] rising from a ridge along the edge of the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

The island was home to a now extinct endemic species of flightless bird, the [[Rodrigues solitaire]] (''Pezophaps solitaria'').

However, on 20 November 2001, the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|Mauritius National Assembly]] unanimously adopted two laws giving Rodrigues its autonomy, creating a decentralised government system. This new legislation has allowed the implementation of a regional assembly in Rodrigues constituting 18 members and an executive council headed by a Chief Commissioner. The council meets every week to make decisions, draw up laws and manage the budget. The [[Chief Commissioner]] has the main task of informing the Mauritian Prime Minister of the management of the island's concerns. The [[2017 Rodriguan local election|last election of the Rodriguan Regional Assembly]] was held on 12 February 2017. The [[Organisation du Peuple de Rodrigues]] (OPR) party was the winner and obtained ten seats, while the [[Mouvement Rodriguais]] (MR) obtained seven. The current chief commissioner is [[Louis Serge Clair]] and the [[Chief Executive of Rodrigues]] is [[Davis Hee Hong Wye]].\n\n===Electoral regions===\nThe island includes six electoral regions: La Ferme (Region 1), Marechal (Region 2), Saint Gabriel (Region 3), Baie aux Huitres (Region 4), Port Mathurin (Region 5) and Grande Montagne (Region 6). Rodrigues Regional Assembly election are held every five years.\n\n===Zones===\nRodrigues is divided into 14 municipalities or zones.

The government provides free education to students up to the tertiary level.\nEducation is taught mainly in [[English language|English]].\n\n==Transportation==\nRodrigues is served by the [[Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport]] in Point Corail.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Rodrigues Cattle August 2015.jpg|alt=Cattle grazing in a hillside field overlooking Rivi\u00e8re Cocos.|thumb|Small-scale cattle rearing contributes to the economy of Rodrigues.]]\nThe economy of Rodrigues is mostly dependent on Mauritius. The main sources of income and economic activity are tourism, fishing, agriculture (especially of onions, garlic and chilli), and animal rearing. The [[handicraft]] industry has proven to be beneficial to the economy of the island. However, the income derived from the export of sea products, cattle, and food crops is smaller than the costs of imported products, creating a deficit.\nIt has a special relationship with English-speaking countries, such as England in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/mauritius/economy|title=Mauritius : Economy - The Commonwealth|website=thecommonwealth.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music and folklore===\nThe traditional music of the island is known as Sega Tambour. The music has an accentuated beat, usually accompanied by an [[accordion]], [[clapping]] and the use of improvised percussion instruments like [[bamboo]]. The [[Dance music#Folk dance music|folk dance music]] is similar to [[polka]]s, [[quadrille]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[Scottish music|Scottish]] [[Reel (dance)|reel]]s.\n\n===Cuisine===\nRodrigues cuisine consists of dishes from local products: fruit, vegetables, seafood (fish, octopus, crab, shrimp, lobster) and meat. National dishes include sausages with kreolin\u0117s, rougaille sauce, octopus with curry, Azim salad and Rodrigues cake.\n\n===Sports===\nThe most common sport in Rodrigues is [[association football]]. There are local competitions almost throughout the year and in specific competitions, the winning team travels to Mauritius for sport exchange. [[Volleyball]] is also popular. There is also a public [[swimming pool]] at Marechal, a village located in the center of the island, and a [[stadium]] at Camp Du Rois in the region of [[Port Mathurin]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\n ================================== ({{NoMoreLinks}}) ==================================\n DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
