In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.

The second official language is the recently standardized [[Haitian Creole]], which virtually the entire population of Haiti speaks. Haitian Creole is one of the [[French-based creole languages]], drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

{"title_page": "Cimarron (novel)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[Image:CimarronNovel.JPG|thumb|First edition ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]]) ]]\n'''''Cimarron''''' is a novel by [[Edna Ferber]], published in April [[1930 in literature|1930]] and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush. The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed [[Cimarron (1931 film)|film]] of the same name in [[1931 in film|1931]] through [[RKO Pictures]]. In [[1960 in film|1960]], the story was again adapted for the screen by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], to meager success.\n\n==Background==\n\n===The Land Rush===\n{{main article|Oklahoma Land Race}}\nThe [[Land Rush of 1889|Oklahoma Land Rush]] (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and [[Cherokee Strip]] [[Land Run]]) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. \"[[Manifest destiny]]\" and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).\n\n[[Image:OkLandRush.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Photograph of the 1893 [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Land Race|Land Rush]], depicted in Ferber's book and films.]]\n\n''Cimarron'' involves two land runs. [[Land Run of 1889|The first]], for the [[Unassigned Lands]], occurred on April 22, 1889. [[Land Run of 1893|The second]], for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893.  The piece of land in question had been allotted to the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] as part of the 1828 [[Treaty of New Echota]], while the rest of the [[Oklahoma Territory]] had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]], cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the [[Cherokee]] on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to [[Texas]]. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.\n\nThroughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93&nbsp;km) wide by 225 miles (362&nbsp;km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.\n\n==The novel==\n''Cimarron'' derives its name from the [[Cimarron Territory]]. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|No Man's Land]], an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] such as the [[Cherokee]] and [[Sioux]]. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel's opening, [[Oklahoma]] is one such \"Cimarron Territory,\" though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the [[Cherokee Outlet]], also known as the [[Cherokee Strip]], and probably the city of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey's tale of his participation in the [[Oklahoma Land Race|1893 land rush]]. They emigrate from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and\u2014unknowingly\u2014a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in [[Oklahoma]].\n\nUpon its publication, ''Cimarron'' was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in [[American history]]. It was the best selling novel of 1930,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html|title=1930: Cimarron by Edna Ferber|last=Kahn|first=Matt|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the [[Great Depression]]. This novel became Ferber's third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an [[Armed Services Edition]] during WWII.\n\nWhile it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat's growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, ''[[A Peculiar Treasure]]'', that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Ann R. |last2= |first2= |date=2002 |title=Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist |url= |journal=Shofar |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=52-60 |doi= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ferber |first=Edna |date=1938 |title=A Peculiar Treasure |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday, Doran, & Co. |page=330 |isbn= |author-link= Edna Ferber }}</ref> Throughout the novel, Sabra's practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to \"civilize\" Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zink |first1=Amanda |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=Peyote in the Kitchen: Gendered Identities and Imperial Domesticity in Edna Ferber's Cimarron |url= |journal=Western American Literature |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=66-86 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Yancey Cravat is based on [[Temple Lea Houston]], last child of Texas icon [[Sam Houston]]. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.\n\n===The author===\n{{main article|Edna Ferber}}\nBorn on August 15, 1885, in [[Michigan]], Ferber had lived through the latter development of the West. She grew up on the stories of her parents and grandparents, who had moved west from [[New York (state)|New York]] many years before her birth.\n\nHer writing career began as a journalist, and Ferber published her first novel in 1911. Ferber's early works were mostly light romance. Her ''So Big'' (1924) brought Ferber more recognition as a novelist.  This novel about love and sacrifice in the Midwest earned Ferber a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. She immersed herself in writing historical epics, including ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', set on and around the [[Mississippi River]], and ''Cimarron'' in 1930.\n\n==Films==\n\n===1931 film===\n{{main article|Cimarron (1931 film)}}\n\n[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber's talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in [[1918 in film|1918]] with the silent ''Our Mrs. McChesney'', based on a play Ferber had written. ''So Big'' was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of ''Gigolo'' and ''Show Boat'' also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to [[RKO Pictures]] in [[1930 in film|1930]] for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).\n\nDespite America being in the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber's novel ''Cimarron''. Director [[Wesley Ruggles]] would direct stars [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] and [[Irene Dunne]] with a script written by [[Howard Estabrook]]. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the [[Jasmin Quinn Ranch]] outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer [[Edward Cronjager]] spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber's descriptions.\n\nThe film was premiered in [[New York City]] on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.\n\n===1960 film===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cimarron1960.jpg|110px|framed|right|Movie poster for 1960 film.]] -->\n{{main article|Cimarron (1960 film)}}\n\nThe remake of ''Cimarron'' included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gaining momentum, the script, written by [[Arnold Schulman]], took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film's centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler ([[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]]) and Wes Jennings ([[Vic Morrow]]), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid's ([[Russ Tamblyn]]) gang.\n\nIn 1961 the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] (art directors [[George Davis (art director)|George W.

The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed [[Cimarron (1931 film)|film]] of the same name in [[1931 in film|1931]] through [[RKO Pictures]]. In [[1960 in film|1960]], the story was again adapted for the screen by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], to meager success.\n\n==Background==\n\n===The Land Rush===\n{{main article|Oklahoma Land Race}}\nThe [[Land Rush of 1889|Oklahoma Land Rush]] (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and [[Cherokee Strip]] [[Land Run]]) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. \"[[Manifest destiny]]\" and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).\n\n[[Image:OkLandRush.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Photograph of the 1893 [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Land Race|Land Rush]], depicted in Ferber's book and films.]]\n\n''Cimarron'' involves two land runs. [[Land Run of 1889|The first]], for the [[Unassigned Lands]], occurred on April 22, 1889. [[Land Run of 1893|The second]], for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893.  The piece of land in question had been allotted to the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] as part of the 1828 [[Treaty of New Echota]], while the rest of the [[Oklahoma Territory]] had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]], cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the [[Cherokee]] on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to [[Texas]]. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.\n\nThroughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93&nbsp;km) wide by 225 miles (362&nbsp;km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.\n\n==The novel==\n''Cimarron'' derives its name from the [[Cimarron Territory]]. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|No Man's Land]], an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] such as the [[Cherokee]] and [[Sioux]]. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel's opening, [[Oklahoma]] is one such \"Cimarron Territory,\" though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the [[Cherokee Outlet]], also known as the [[Cherokee Strip]], and probably the city of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey's tale of his participation in the [[Oklahoma Land Race|1893 land rush]]. They emigrate from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and\u2014unknowingly\u2014a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in [[Oklahoma]].\n\nUpon its publication, ''Cimarron'' was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in [[American history]]. It was the best selling novel of 1930,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html|title=1930: Cimarron by Edna Ferber|last=Kahn|first=Matt|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the [[Great Depression]]. This novel became Ferber's third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an [[Armed Services Edition]] during WWII.\n\nWhile it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat's growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, ''[[A Peculiar Treasure]]'', that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Ann R. |last2= |first2= |date=2002 |title=Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist |url= |journal=Shofar |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=52-60 |doi= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ferber |first=Edna |date=1938 |title=A Peculiar Treasure |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday, Doran, & Co. |page=330 |isbn= |author-link= Edna Ferber }}</ref> Throughout the novel, Sabra's practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to \"civilize\" Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zink |first1=Amanda |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=Peyote in the Kitchen: Gendered Identities and Imperial Domesticity in Edna Ferber's Cimarron |url= |journal=Western American Literature |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=66-86 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Yancey Cravat is based on [[Temple Lea Houston]], last child of Texas icon [[Sam Houston]]. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.\n\n===The author===\n{{main article|Edna Ferber}}\nBorn on August 15, 1885, in [[Michigan]], Ferber had lived through the latter development of the West. She grew up on the stories of her parents and grandparents, who had moved west from [[New York (state)|New York]] many years before her birth.\n\nHer writing career began as a journalist, and Ferber published her first novel in 1911. Ferber's early works were mostly light romance. Her ''So Big'' (1924) brought Ferber more recognition as a novelist.  This novel about love and sacrifice in the Midwest earned Ferber a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. She immersed herself in writing historical epics, including ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', set on and around the [[Mississippi River]], and ''Cimarron'' in 1930.\n\n==Films==\n\n===1931 film===\n{{main article|Cimarron (1931 film)}}\n\n[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber's talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in [[1918 in film|1918]] with the silent ''Our Mrs. McChesney'', based on a play Ferber had written. ''So Big'' was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of ''Gigolo'' and ''Show Boat'' also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to [[RKO Pictures]] in [[1930 in film|1930]] for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).\n\nDespite America being in the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber's novel ''Cimarron''. Director [[Wesley Ruggles]] would direct stars [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] and [[Irene Dunne]] with a script written by [[Howard Estabrook]]. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the [[Jasmin Quinn Ranch]] outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer [[Edward Cronjager]] spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber's descriptions.\n\nThe film was premiered in [[New York City]] on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.\n\n===1960 film===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cimarron1960.jpg|110px|framed|right|Movie poster for 1960 film.]] -->\n{{main article|Cimarron (1960 film)}}\n\nThe remake of ''Cimarron'' included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gaining momentum, the script, written by [[Arnold Schulman]], took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film's centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler ([[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]]) and Wes Jennings ([[Vic Morrow]]), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid's ([[Russ Tamblyn]]) gang.\n\nIn 1961 the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] (art directors [[George Davis (art director)|George W. Davis]] and [[Addison Hehr]]) and [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]], but failed to win either. ''Cimarron'' marked the end of the Ferber adaptations.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*  ''[[Far and Away]]'' (1992), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman\n*  ''[[Oklahoma Land Race]]'' (1893)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{cite book | author=Bart, Peter | title=Fade Out: The Calamitous Final Days of MGM | publisher=Anchor Books | year=1991 | isbn=0-385-41892-2}}\n* {{cite book | author=Ferber, Edna | title=Cimarron | publisher=Grosset & Dunlap | year=1930 | isbn=1-199-73350-4}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Jewell, Richard B. |author2=Harbin, Vernon | title=The RKO Story | publisher=Arlington House | year=1982 | isbn=0-517-54656-6}}\n* {{cite book | author=Neibaur, James L. | title=The RKO Features | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2005 | isbn=0-7864-2166-5}}\n\n==Book Reviews==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140130053403/http://anotherlookbook.com/cimarron-edna-ferber/ Another look book] (Archived)\n*[http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html Kahn's Corner]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202191218/http://qcpages.qc.edu/Biology/LahtiSites/greatlit/contempus/ferber/cimarron.htm Reflections on Great Literature]\n\n{{Edna Ferber}}\n[[Category:1930 American novels]]\n[[Category:American historical novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Doubleday (publisher) books]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) novels]]\n", "name_user": "LiteratureCompanion", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBook Reviews", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimarron_(novel)"}

Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], [[maritime patrol]], and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[tactical airlift]]er for many military forces worldwide. More than 40 variants of the Hercules, including civilian versions marketed as the [[Lockheed L-100]], operate in more than 60 nations.\n\nThe C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft{{refn|The C-130 was fifth aircraft after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer as of 2007.|group= N}} to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which for the C-130 is the [[United States Air Force]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The C-130 Hercules is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at over 60 years, with the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] currently being produced.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stokes |first=Stephannie |date=29 December 2015 |title=C-130 aircraft designed in the 1950s still delivers |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]] |access-date=2 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102185645/http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Background and requirements===\nThe [[Korean War]] showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports\u2014[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s\u2014were no longer adequate. Thus, on 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and Airlifts Inc.\n\nThe new transport would have a capacity of 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that was approximately {{cvt|41|ft}} long, {{cvt|9|ft}} high, and {{cvt|10|ft}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed specifically as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage. A key feature was the introduction of the [[Allison T56]] [[turboprop]] powerplant, which was developed for the C-130. The turboprop offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure [[turbojet]]s, which were faster but consumed more fuel. They also produced much more power for their weight than piston engines.\n\n===Design phase===\nThe Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the [[Chase XCG-20|Chase XCG-20 Avitruc]], which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm \"Chase XCG-20 Avitruc.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130003025/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm |date=30 January 2011 }} ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] had rear ramps, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the airplane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included a [[Low-altitude parachute-extraction system]] for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised \"[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]\" bombs. The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down.\n\nFairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.\n\nThe Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130-page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.<ref name=\"rhodes\">Rhodes, Jeff. \"Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules.\" ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004.</ref> [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, \"If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.\"<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.<ref name=\"boyne\">Boyne, Walter J.

This greatly reduced landing speed to just 63 knots, and cut landing distance in half. The system never entered service because it did not improve takeoff performance by the same margin, making the landing performance pointless if the aircraft could not also take off from where it had landed.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.29</ref>\n\nAn electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.\n\nThe extended-range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[aileron]]s was reduced back to {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966\u201367 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.\n\nThe ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F'' procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&nbsp;US gal (13,626&nbsp;L) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&nbsp;US gal per minute (1,136&nbsp;L per minute) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:RAAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules AVV Creek.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force]] C-130H, 2007]]\n\nThe ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with reduced amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range.<ref>Cassidy, J. \"[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA391744 C-130 Transportability of Army Vehicles]\" p. 3. ''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'', 2001</ref> The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) service in 1958.  The U.S. Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.\n\n[[File:USCG_HC-130H.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Coast Guard]] HC-130H]]\nC-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF.

The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&nbsp;in (2.54&nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&nbsp;in (2.03&nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-testbed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130Ks (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm \"C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605224813/http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm |date=5 June 2008 }} ''doppeladler.com''.

The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions vairiant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.\n\n[[File:HC-130P-N refuels HH-60G.jpg|thumb|USAF HC-130P refuels a [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter]]\nThe ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.\n\nThe ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.\n\nThe RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].\n\nThe ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.\n\n===Next generation===\n{{main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.\n\nBuilding on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html NASA and Lockheed Martin Partners In C-130 Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614010311/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html |date=14 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref> Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf The High Technology Test Bed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123150753/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf |date=23 January 2013 }} Lockheed Service News Vol. 12 No. 3, September 1985.

After the failure of the [[Black Cat Squadron]] to plant operating sensor pods near the [[Lop Nur]] Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a [[Lockheed U-2]], the [[CIA]] developed a plan, named ''Heavy Tea'', to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a Black Bat Squadron crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months before their batteries failed. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets.

Approaching the drop zone, Spare 617 received heavy enemy ground fire that damaged two engines, ruptured a bleed air duct in the cargo compartment, and set the ammunition on fire. Flight engineer TSgt Sanders was killed, and navigator 1st Lt Lenz and co-pilot 1st Lt Hering were both wounded. Despite receiving severe burns from hot air escaping from the damaged air bleed duct, loadmaster TSgt Shaub extinguished a fire in the cargo compartment, and successfully jettisoned the cargo pallets, which exploded in mid-air. Despite losing a third engine on final approach, pilot Capt Caldwell landed Spare 617 safely.

Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], [[maritime patrol]], and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[tactical airlift]]er for many military forces worldwide. More than 40 variants of the Hercules, including civilian versions marketed as the [[Lockheed L-100]], operate in more than 60 nations.\n\nThe C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft{{refn|The C-130 was fifth aircraft after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer as of 2007.|group= N}} to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which for the C-130 is the [[United States Air Force]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The C-130 Hercules is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at over 60 years, with the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] currently being produced.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stokes |first=Stephannie |date=29 December 2015 |title=C-130 aircraft designed in the 1950s still delivers |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]] |access-date=2 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102185645/http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Background and requirements===\nThe [[Korean War]] showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports\u2014[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s\u2014were no longer adequate. Thus, on 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and Airlifts Inc.\n\nThe new transport would have a capacity of 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that was approximately {{cvt|41|ft}} long, {{cvt|9|ft}} high, and {{cvt|10|ft}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed specifically as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage. A key feature was the introduction of the [[Allison T56]] [[turboprop]] powerplant, which was developed for the C-130. The turboprop offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure [[turbojet]]s, which were faster but consumed more fuel. They also produced much more power for their weight than piston engines.\n\n===Design phase===\nThe Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the [[Chase XCG-20|Chase XCG-20 Avitruc]], which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm \"Chase XCG-20 Avitruc.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130003025/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm |date=30 January 2011 }} ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] had rear ramps, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the airplane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included a [[Low-altitude parachute-extraction system]] for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised \"[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]\" bombs. The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down.\n\nFairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.\n\nThe Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130-page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.<ref name=\"rhodes\">Rhodes, Jeff. \"Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules.\" ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004.</ref> [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, \"If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.\"<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.<ref name=\"boyne\">Boyne, Walter J.

Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A-models were equipped with [[ski]]s and re-designated ''C-130D''.  As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added with wing pylon-mounted tanks outboard of the engines; this added 6,000&nbsp;lb (2,720&nbsp;kg) of fuel capacity for a total capacity of 40,000&nbsp;lb (18,140&nbsp;kg).<ref>https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/c-130-bar.htm</ref>\n\n===Improved versions===\n[[File:C-130E Hercules dropping flares.jpg|thumb|A [[Michigan Air National Guard]] C-130E dispatches its flares during a low-level training mission]]\n[[File:One U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft taxis as another takes off from Yeo Ju airstrip during the joint U.S.-South Korean Exercise Team Spirit '84 DF-ST-84-11567.jpg|thumb|Two C-130 Hercules in South Korea]]\n[[File:A C-130 Hercules from the 36th Airlift Squadron conducts a night flight mission over Yokota Air Base (26385249024).jpg|thumb|A C-130 conducts a night flight mission over [[Yokota Air Base]]]]\n\nThe C-130B model was developed to complement the A-models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aeroproducts three-blade propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models.  The C-130B had [[aileron]]s operated by hydraulic pressure that was increased from {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}, as well as uprated engines and four-blade propellers that were standard until the J-model.\n\nThe B model was originally intended to have \"blown controls\", a system which blows high pressure air over the control surfaces in order to improve their effectiveness during slow flight. It was tested on a NC-130B prototype aircraft with a pair of T-56 turbines providing high pressure air through a duct system to the control surfaces and flaps during landing. This greatly reduced landing speed to just 63 knots, and cut landing distance in half. The system never entered service because it did not improve takeoff performance by the same margin, making the landing performance pointless if the aircraft could not also take off from where it had landed.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.29</ref>\n\nAn electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.\n\nThe extended-range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[aileron]]s was reduced back to {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966\u201367 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.\n\nThe ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F'' procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&nbsp;US gal (13,626&nbsp;L) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&nbsp;US gal per minute (1,136&nbsp;L per minute) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:RAAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules AVV Creek.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force]] C-130H, 2007]]\n\nThe ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with reduced amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range.<ref>Cassidy, J. \"[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA391744 C-130 Transportability of Army Vehicles]\" p. 3. ''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'', 2001</ref> The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) service in 1958.  The U.S. Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.\n\n[[File:USCG_HC-130H.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Coast Guard]] HC-130H]]\nC-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF.

The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&nbsp;in (2.54&nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&nbsp;in (2.03&nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-testbed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130Ks (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm \"C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605224813/http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm |date=5 June 2008 }} ''doppeladler.com''.

The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.\n\n[[File:HC-130P-N refuels HH-60G.jpg|thumb|USAF HC-130P refuels a [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter]]\nThe ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.\n\nThe ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.\n\nThe RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].\n\nThe ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.\n\n===Next generation===\n{{main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.\n\nBuilding on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html NASA and Lockheed Martin Partners In C-130 Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614010311/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html |date=14 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref> Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf The High Technology Test Bed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123150753/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf |date=23 January 2013 }} Lockheed Service News Vol. 12 No. 3, September 1985.

The new aircraft is to carry a 190 percent greater payload and assume the mission of mounted vertical maneuver (MVM). The greater payload and mission would enable it to carry medium-weight armored vehicles and drop them off at locations without long runways.  Various options are being considered, including new or upgraded fixed-wing designs, rotorcraft, [[tiltrotor]]s, or even an [[airship]].

The British also used RAF C-130s to support their logistical operations.\n\n[[File:C-130T Hercules Blue Angels.jpg|thumb|USMC C-130T ''Fat Albert'' performing a [[JATO|rocket-assisted takeoff]] (RATO)]]\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 ([[Operation Desert Storm]]), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, along with the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UK. The [[MC-130 Combat Talon]] variant also made the first attacks using the largest conventional [[bomb]]s in the world, the [[BLU-82]] \"Daisy Cutter\" and [[GBU-43/B]] \"Massive Ordnance Air Blast\" (MOAB) bomb. Daisy Cutters were used to primaily clear landing zones and to eliminate [[mine field]]s. The weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional [[bomber aircraft|bombers]]. The GBU-43/B MOAB is a successor to the BLU-82 and can perform the same function, as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment.\n\nSince 1992, two successive C-130 aircraft named ''Fat Albert'' have served as the support aircraft for the U.S. Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team.

At some [[air show]]s featuring the team, ''Fat Albert'' takes part, performing flyovers. Until 2009, it also demonstrated its [[JATO|rocket-assisted takeoff]] (RATO) capabilities; these ended due to dwindling supplies of rockets.<ref name=\"FA JATO\">McCullough, Amy. \"Abort Launch: Air shows to do without Fat Albert's famed JATO.\" ''[[Marine Corps Times]],'' 9 November 2009.

From 22 to 24 October 1997, two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field, Florida to Taegu (Daegu), [[South Korea]], being refuelled seven times by KC-135 tanker aircraft. This record flight beat the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours and the two gunships took on {{convert|410000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel.
