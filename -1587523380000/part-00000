In the episode, the Doctor meets Jackson Lake, a human with memory loss who believes he is the Doctor. The two of them discover a plot by the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] to create a giant-sized Cyberman called a CyberKing which is controlled by the workhouse matron Miss Hartigan ([[Dervla Kirwan]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Tenth Doctor]] lands his [[TARDIS]] in London on Christmas Eve, 1851. Overhearing cries for help, he encounters a man calling himself \"the Doctor\" and his companion Rosita, attempting and failing to capture a [[Cyberman#Variants|Cybershade]]. The Doctor believes the man, who is suffering from amnesia, may be a future incarnation of himself. The man, dubbed the Next Doctor, takes the Doctor to a nearby house of a recently deceased reverend, believing him tied to a series of disappearances around London and the Cybershade. Inside, they discover a pair of [[Cyberman]] data-storage infostamps, which the Next Doctor recalls holding the night that he lost his memories.\n\nThe two Doctors regroup with Rosita at the Next Doctor's base. The Doctor comes to realise that the Next Doctor is really a human, Jackson Lake, the supposed first missing person. The Doctor suspects that Jackson had encountered the Cybermen and used the infostamps, containing knowledge of the Doctor, to ward them off. Jackson's mind then entered a [[fugue state]] from the trauma of the Cybermen killing his wife, and as the infostamp had infused his mind with knowledge of the Doctor, he came to believe he was the Doctor. The Doctor and Rosita set off to try to find the source of the Cybermen.\n \nThe Doctor and Rosita find numerous children, pulled from workhouses around the city by Miss Mercy Hartigan, are being put to work at an underground facility under Cybermen guard. The Cybermen betray Miss Hartigan, and convert her into the controller for the \"CyberKing\", a giant mechanical Cyberman powered by the energy generated by the children. She also gains control over the Cybermen. Jackson remembers encountering the Cybermen on moving into his new home. The Doctor discovers another entrance to the Cybermen's base under Jackson's house. Within the complex, as the CyberKing starts to rise to the city, the three rescue the children, including Jackson's son, who was abducted in the initial attack that triggered Jackson's fugue state. The CyberKing starts to lay waste to the city. When Miss Hartigan refuses the Doctor's offer to leave the planet, the Doctor uses the infostamps to sever her connection to the CyberKing, exposing her to the raw emotion of what she has done. The emotional feedback destroys both the Cybermen and Miss Hartigan. As the CyberKing starts to topple, the Doctor draws it into the Time Vortex with technology from Jackson's cellar, saving London. The episode ends with The Doctor and Jackson heading off to attend Christmas dinner in remembrance of those they have lost.\n\n===Continuity===\nAccording to [[Neil Gaiman]], the Cybus Industries Cybermen \"zapped off into time and space\" by the Doctor at the end of this episode eventually encountered the [[Mondas]] Cybermen; their \"cross-breeding and interchange of technology\" resulted in the variety of Cybermen seen in \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/05/07/exclusive-neil-gaiman-talks-doctor-who-and-cybermen/|title=EXCLUSIVE \u2013 Neil Gaiman Talks Doctor Who And Cybermen|magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|last=Setchfields|first=Nick|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:DoctorWhoExhibition 089 (4262528286).jpg|right|thumb|180px|A Cybershade on display at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nPre-broadcast publicity, based on excerpts from Davies' book ''Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale'', revealed that the Doctor would meet a man played by David Morrissey who also claims to be the Doctor. In further excerpts, Davies commented, \"The best title for this episode would be ''The Two Doctors''...&nbsp;but maybe not. ''The New Doctor'', perhaps? Or ''The Next Doctor''? I quite like ''The Next Doctor''.\"<ref name=\"WritersTaleBook\">{{Cite book| last=Davies | first=Russell T | authorlink=Russell T Davies |author2=Cook, Benjamin |authorlink2=Benjamin Cook (journalist)  | title=The Writer's Tale | publisher=[[BBC Books]] | date=25 September 2008 | pages=500\u2013502 | isbn=978-1-84607-571-1}}</ref> The book also contained two pictures from a scene cut from the end of the previous episode, intended to segue into the special echoing the previous two series. This scene was included on the series boxset.\n\nFollowing the success of last year's Christmas special, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", which guest starred pop star [[Kylie Minogue]] as one-off companion [[Astrid Peth]], Russell T Davies had initially felt tempted to copy this format with another high-profile guest star, but decided against it after jokingly offering up \"[[Cheryl Cole]] on board the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''\" as an example.<ref name=\"Doctor Who Confidential\" />\n\nRegarding an unanswered question (from a child) of why a gigantic robot in London 1851 \"isn't in the history books\", Davies and Gardner jokingly offer several possibilities ranging from there being alternate history of ''Doctor Who'' England, pointing out \"a spaceship didn't fly into the [[Big Ben]] in 2006 either\" (in the episode \"[[Aliens of London]]\") or that perhaps \"maybe everyone was [[List of Torchwood items#A|retconned]] by the soon-to-be-born [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]], or something.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" /> A line in [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[Doctor Who (2010 series)|series 5]] episode \"[[Flesh and Stone]]\" has the Doctor recall the Cyberking's rampage, attributing history's failure to record it to the cracks in time and space that are causing time to be unwritten.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Flesh and Stone]]|series=[[Doctor Who]]|credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), Adam Smith (director), [[Tracie Simpson]] (producer)|airdate=1 May 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|seriesno=5|number=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Cooper|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|title=Doctor Who: Season 5, Episode 5: \"Flesh and Stone\"|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=4 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518204446/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|archivedate=18 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nDavies, from a writer's standpoint, was also unhappy with the final scene in the episode where the Doctor gets rid of the Cyberking with the convenient Dalek dimension vault but during the writing process he couldn't think of another way to stop London being crushed by a giant robot. Later, after the episode was produced, a different idea came to him. In this alternate ending Davies imagines, Miss Hartigan \"should have destroyed the Cybermen when she screamed... but she's still in the chair\", as the Cyberking falls to the Earth, the Doctor calls out to her saying \"Save them.\" This version would have Hartigan redeem herself as she is the one to cause the Cyberking to disappear, with no need for what Davies calls \"a silly Dalek continuum dimension vault\". Julie Gardner felt this would have been a superior, \"marvellous\" ending and Davies says he \"can't bear that there could have been a better ending than we actually transmitted\".<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies also feels he would like to write a [[BBC Books]] novel, set in the midst of that brief scene where Jackson Lake is in the Doctor's TARDIS in which the Doctor takes Jackson to another planet, ending with the \"no no no\" scene before Jackson invites the Doctor to spend Christmas dinner with him.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies claims that he attempted to make Jackson Lake's companion Rosita a combination of Rose and Martha so that she felt like a companion before she had done anything.<ref name=\"Next Doctor Commentary Podcast\">{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Russell T|title=The Next Doctor Commentary Podcast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S0_05|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nFilming for this episode was conducted in April 2008 at [[Gloucester Cathedral]],<ref name=\"Hello\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2008/04/23/doctor-who-christmas/ | work=[[Hello Magazine]] | title=David films 'Dr Who' Christmas special in 'snowy' Gloucester | accessdate=5 July 2008 | date=23 April 2008}}</ref> [[St Woolos Cemetery]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]<ref name=\"Argus\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/swanews/display.var.2188951.0.cybermen_invade_newport.php | work=[[South Wales Argus]] | accessdate=5 July 2008 | author=David Deans | date=4 April 2008 | title=Cybermen invade Newport}}</ref> and the streets of Gloucester, where shooting was hampered by up to 1,000 onlookers.

A lot of her characterisation goes unstated, but Russell discussed it in long conversations with Dervla Kirwan and fellow executive producer Julie Gardner. Davies characterises Miss Hartigan as \"a victim of abuse\", for whom the [[subtext]] suggests a \"terrible [[back-story|backstory]]\" which is symptomatic of her being \"part of [this] Victorian Age.\" Davies describes this as being \"a powerless woman who's been in servitude or far worse all her life\", but holds his tongue from saying her precise profession, relaying: \"I'm talking quite discreetly around this because there are children listening and watching and there's only so far I should go.\" He does however explain that \"She's had terrible things done to her\" which is responsible for her \"really twisted character where she sexualises everything.\" In terms of costume, \"she wears red\" because \"everything's inflammatory with her\". \"And in the end, actually\" Davies discusses how to escape her male oppression she \"becomes a man, she becomes the CyberKing. She has to go through this extraordinary process because she's so damaged.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/> Kirwan would later go on to voice Miss Quill, replacing the previous actress [[Katherine Kelly]], in the audio dramas of Doctor Who spin-off [[Class (2016 TV series)|\"Class\"]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] in 2019.\n\n===Design===\nMillennium FX's Neil Gorton's original design for the Cybershade took the existing Cyberman design and \"refurbished\" it by adding rivets and a copper finish. The design was cost-effective but Russell T Davies did not believe it was the right approach. He sketched a new design for the Cybershade that was \"a crude version of a Cyberman, all angular and blocky, with its trademark handlebars set at a jaunty angle and shrouded in flowing black robes\". Gorton used Davies' sketch to create a fibreglass mask that the Cybershade actors wore over their heads. Costume designer Louise Page made the flowing robes, that were \"light enough to not restrict movement\" to complete the Cybershade costume.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Gorton | first = Neil | date= 10 December 2008 | title= How I... designed the Cybershade | url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/technology/indepth/2008/12/how_i_designed_the_cybershade.html | work= Broadcastnow | publisher= Emap Media | accessdate= 11 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Gardner relayed that there was a widespread dissatisfaction with Hartigan's CyberKing crown. The original helmet, he remarked \"was like the Cyberwoman's head from ''[[Torchwood]]''\" (referring to the episode \"[[Cyberwoman]]\"), literally \"a Cyberman's head on Dervla Kirwan\" or \"as if Dervla Kirwan decided to go to a [fancy dress] party as a Cyberman.\" Davies' response was \"Oh my lord, no.\" The production team however worked hard, and in two days produced the final headpiece seen in the episode which Davies described as \"beautiful\", because it's \"Victorian and it fits the design.\" In the scene after the headpiece is placed on her, Dervla wore black contact lenses and SFX company The Mill helped to get rid of \"any traces of white\" in post-production.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast===\nPreliminary figures show that the episode had a viewing audience of 11.71 million during its original airing, with a peak at 12.58 million viewers, and a 50.5% share of the 18:00 timeslot it was shown.

In the episode, the Doctor meets Jackson Lake, a human with memory loss who believes he is the Doctor. The two of them discover a plot by the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] to create a giant-sized Cyberman called a CyberKing which is controlled by the workhouse matron Miss Hartigan ([[Dervla Kirwan]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Tenth Doctor]] lands his [[TARDIS]] in London on Christmas Eve, 1851. Overhearing cries for help, he encounters a man calling himself \"the Doctor\" and his companion Rosita, attempting and failing to capture a [[Cyberman#Variants|Cybershade]]. The Doctor believes the man, who is suffering from amnesia, may be a future incarnation of himself. The man, dubbed the Next Doctor, takes the Doctor to a nearby house of a recently deceased reverend, believing him tied to a series of disappearances around London and the Cybershade. Inside, they discover a pair of [[Cyberman]] data-storage infostamps, which the Next Doctor recalls holding the night that he lost his memories.\n\nThe two Doctors regroup with Rosita at the Next Doctor's base. The Doctor comes to realise that the Next Doctor is really a human, Jackson Lake, the supposed first missing person. The Doctor suspects that Jackson had encountered the Cybermen and used the infostamps, containing knowledge of the Doctor, to ward them off. Jackson's mind then entered a [[fugue state]] from the trauma of the Cybermen killing his wife, and as the infostamp had infused his mind with knowledge of the Doctor, he came to believe he was the Doctor. The Doctor and Rosita set off to try to find the source of the Cybermen.\n \nThe Doctor and Rosita find numerous children, pulled from workhouses around the city by Miss Mercy Hartigan, are being put to work at an underground facility under Cybermen guard. The Cybermen betray Miss Hartigan, and convert her into the controller for the \"CyberKing\", a giant mechanical Cyberman powered by the energy generated by the children. She also gains control over the Cybermen. Jackson remembers encountering the Cybermen on moving into his new home. The Doctor discovers another entrance to the Cybermen's base under Jackson's house. Within the complex, as the CyberKing starts to rise to the city, the three rescue the children, including Jackson's son, who was abducted in the initial attack that triggered Jackson's fugue state. The CyberKing starts to lay waste to the city. When Miss Hartigan refuses the Doctor's offer to leave the planet, the Doctor uses the infostamps to sever her connection to the CyberKing, exposing her to the raw emotion of what she has done. The emotional feedback destroys both the Cybermen and Miss Hartigan. As the CyberKing starts to topple, the Doctor draws it into the Time Vortex with technology from Jackson's cellar, saving London. The episode ends with The Doctor and Jackson heading off to attend Christmas dinner in remembrance of those they have lost.\n\n===Continuity===\nAccording to [[Neil Gaiman]], the Cybus Industries Cybermen \"zapped off into time and space\" by the Doctor at the end of this episode eventually encountered the [[Mondas]] Cybermen; their \"cross-breeding and interchange of technology\" resulted in the variety of Cybermen seen in \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/05/07/exclusive-neil-gaiman-talks-doctor-who-and-cybermen/|title=EXCLUSIVE \u2013 Neil Gaiman Talks Doctor Who And Cybermen|magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|last=Setchfields|first=Nick|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:DoctorWhoExhibition 089 (4262528286).jpg|right|thumb|180px|A Cybershade on display at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nPre-broadcast publicity, based on excerpts from Davies' book ''Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale'', revealed that the Doctor would meet a man played by David Morrissey who also claims to be the Doctor. In further excerpts, Davies commented, \"The best title for this episode would be ''The Two Doctors''...&nbsp;but maybe not. ''The New Doctor'', perhaps? Or ''The Next Doctor''? I quite like ''The Next Doctor''.\"<ref name=\"WritersTaleBook\">{{Cite book| last=Davies | first=Russell T | authorlink=Russell T Davies |author2=Cook, Benjamin |authorlink2=Benjamin Cook (journalist)  | title=The Writer's Tale | publisher=[[BBC Books]] | date=25 September 2008 | pages=500\u2013502 | isbn=978-1-84607-571-1}}</ref> The book also contained two pictures from a scene cut from the end of the previous episode, intended to segue into the special echoing the previous two series. This scene was included on the series boxset.\n\nFollowing the success of last year's Christmas special, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", which guest starred pop star [[Kylie Minogue]] as one-off companion [[Astrid Peth]], Russell T Davies had initially felt tempted to copy this format with another high-profile guest star, but decided against it after jokingly offering up \"[[Cheryl Cole]] on board the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''\" as an example.<ref name=\"Doctor Who Confidential\" />\n\nRegarding an unanswered question (from a child) of why a gigantic robot in London 1851 \"isn't in the history books\", Davies and Gardner jokingly offer several possibilities ranging from there being alternate history of ''Doctor Who'' England, pointing out \"a spaceship didn't fly into the [[Big Ben]] in 2006 either\" (in the episode \"[[Aliens of London]]\") or that perhaps \"maybe everyone was [[List of Torchwood items#A|retconned]] by the soon-to-be-born [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]], or something.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" /> A line in [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[Doctor Who (2010 series)|series 5]] episode \"[[Flesh and Stone]]\" has the Doctor recall the Cyberking's rampage, attributing history's failure to record it to the cracks in time and space that are causing time to be unwritten.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Flesh and Stone]]|series=[[Doctor Who]]|credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), Adam Smith (director), [[Tracie Simpson]] (producer)|airdate=1 May 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]|seriesno=5|number=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Cooper|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|title=Doctor Who: Season 5, Episode 5: \"Flesh and Stone\"|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=4 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518204446/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/05/doctor-who-season-5-episode-5-%E2%80%9Cflesh-and-stone%E2%80%9D/|archivedate=18 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nDavies, from a writer's standpoint, was also unhappy with the final scene in the episode where the Doctor gets rid of the Cyberking with the convenient Dalek dimension vault but during the writing process he couldn't think of another way to stop London being crushed by a giant robot. Later, after the episode was produced, a different idea came to him. In this alternate ending Davies imagines, Miss Hartigan \"should have destroyed the Cybermen when she screamed... but she's still in the chair\", as the Cyberking falls to the Earth, the Doctor calls out to her saying \"Save them.\" This version would have Hartigan redeem herself as she is the one to cause the Cyberking to disappear, with no need for what Davies calls \"a silly Dalek continuum dimension vault\". Julie Gardner felt this would have been a superior, \"marvellous\" ending and Davies says he \"can't bear that there could have been a better ending than we actually transmitted\".<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies also feels he would like to write a [[BBC Books]] novel, set in the midst of that brief scene where Jackson Lake is in the Doctor's TARDIS in which the Doctor takes Jackson to another planet, ending with the \"no no no\" scene before Jackson invites the Doctor to spend Christmas dinner with him.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\" />\n\nDavies claims that he attempted to make Jackson Lake's companion Rosita a combination of Rose and Martha so that she felt like a companion before she had done anything.<ref name=\"Next Doctor Commentary Podcast\">{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Russell T|title=The Next Doctor Commentary Podcast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S0_05|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nFilming for this episode was conducted in April 2008 at [[Gloucester Cathedral]],<ref name=\"Hello\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2008/04/23/doctor-who-christmas/ | work=[[Hello Magazine]] | title=David films 'Dr Who' Christmas special in 'snowy' Gloucester | accessdate=5 July 2008 | date=23 April 2008}}</ref> [[St Woolos Cemetery]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]<ref name=\"Argus\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/swanews/display.var.2188951.0.cybermen_invade_newport.php | work=[[South Wales Argus]] | accessdate=5 July 2008 | author=David Deans | date=4 April 2008 | title=Cybermen invade Newport}}</ref> and the streets of Gloucester, where shooting was hampered by up to 1,000 onlookers.

A lot of her characterisation goes unstated, but Russell discussed it in long conversations with Dervla Kirwan and fellow executive producer Julie Gardner. Davies characterises Miss Hartigan as \"a victim of abuse\", for whom the [[subtext]] suggests a \"terrible [[back-story|backstory]]\" which is symptomatic of her being \"part of [this] Victorian Age.\" Davies describes this as being \"a powerless woman who's been in servitude or far worse all her life\", but holds his tongue from saying her precise profession, relaying: \"I'm talking quite discreetly around this because there are children listening and watching and there's only so far I should go.\" He does however explain that \"She's had terrible things done to her\" which is responsible for her \"really twisted character where she sexualises everything.\" In terms of costume, \"she wears red\" because \"everything's inflammatory with her\". \"And in the end, actually\" Davies discusses how to escape her male oppression she \"becomes a man, she becomes the CyberKing. She has to go through this extraordinary process because she's so damaged.\"<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/>\n\n===Design===\nMillennium FX's Neil Gorton's original design for the Cybershade took the existing Cyberman design and \"refurbished\" it by adding rivets and a copper finish. The design was cost-effective but Russell T Davies did not believe it was the right approach. He sketched a new design for the Cybershade that was \"a crude version of a Cyberman, all angular and blocky, with its trademark handlebars set at a jaunty angle and shrouded in flowing black robes\". Gorton used Davies' sketch to create a fibreglass mask that the Cybershade actors wore over their heads. Costume designer Louise Page made the flowing robes, that were \"light enough to not restrict movement\" to complete the Cybershade costume.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Gorton | first = Neil | date= 10 December 2008 | title= How I... designed the Cybershade | url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/technology/indepth/2008/12/how_i_designed_the_cybershade.html | work= Broadcastnow | publisher= Emap Media | accessdate= 11 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Gardner relayed that there was a widespread dissatisfaction with Hartigan's CyberKing crown. The original helmet, he remarked \"was like the Cyberwoman's head from ''[[Torchwood]]''\" (referring to the episode \"[[Cyberwoman]]\"), literally \"a Cyberman's head on Dervla Kirwan\" or \"as if Dervla Kirwan decided to go to a [fancy dress] party as a Cyberman.\" Davies' response was \"Oh my lord, no.\" The production team however worked hard, and in two days produced the final headpiece seen in the episode which Davies described as \"beautiful\", because it's \"Victorian and it fits the design.\" In the scene after the headpiece is placed on her, Dervla wore black contact lenses and SFX company The Mill helped to get rid of \"any traces of white\" in post-production.<ref name=\"Doctor Who: The Commentaries\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast===\nPreliminary figures show that the episode had a viewing audience of 11.71 million during its original airing, with a peak at 12.58 million viewers, and a 50.5% share of the 18:00 timeslot it was shown.

In the narrative of the [[Brit milah|covenant of circumcision]] in Genesis 17, during which [[Yahweh]] promises Abram that he and Sarai will have a son, Abram is renamed as Abraham and Sarai is renamed as Sarah.

On the journey to Egypt, Abram instructed Sarai to identify herself only as his sister, fearing that the Egyptians would kill him in order to take his wife, saying, \"I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'this is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.\"<ref>Genesis 12:11-13, NIV</ref> When brought before [[Pharaoh]], Sarai said that Abram was her brother, and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. It is possible that Sarai acquired her Egyptian handmaid Hagar during this stay. However, God afflicted Pharaoh's household with great plagues.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:14\u201317|HE}}</ref> Pharaoh then realized that Sarai was Abram's wife and demanded that they leave Egypt immediately.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:18\u201320|HE}}</ref>\n\n===Hagar and Ishmael===\n[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. \u00c0 Paris chez Fr.

Sarah is seen at the left, looking on.]]\n\nAfter having lived in Canaan for ten years and still childless, Sarai suggested that Abram have a child with her Egyptian handmaid Hagar, to which he agreed. This resulted in tension between Sarai and [[Hagar]], and Sarai complained to her husband that the handmaid no longer respected her.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:1\u20136|HE}}</ref> At one point, Hagar fled from her mistress but returned after angels consoled her.

God gave Sarai the new name \"Sarah\", and blessed her.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:1\u201327|HE}}</ref> Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child \"[[Isaac]]\" (Hebrew yitschaq, \"laughter\") and circumcised him when he was eight days old.<ref>{{bibleref|Genesis|21:4|9}}</ref> For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"God had made me to laugh, ''[so that]'' all that hear will laugh with me.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Genesis|21:6\u20137|9}}</ref> Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned.

While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King [[Abimelech]] subsequently had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that was why he continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:1\u20137|HE}}</ref>\n\nEarly next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham replied that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Gen.|20:12|9|Genesis 20:12}}</ref> Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands.

She is born '''Sarai''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9) in [[Ur Ka\u015bdim]], or Ur of the Chaldees, believed to have been in present-day [[Iraq]], 1,958 years following [[Creation (Bible)|Creation]], according to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. She was the daughter of [[Terah]], an [[Idolatrous|idolater]] who worshiped the Moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham/The-Genesis-narrative-in-the-light-of-recent-scholarship</ref> and high-ranking servant of [[Nimrod]], the king of [[Shinar]], or [[Mesopotamia]], but not of his wife, Amathlai. Her name is a feminine form of ''sar'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05e8}}), meaning \"chieftain\" or \"prince.\" Through Terah, she would have been a 10th-generation descendant of [[Noah]], still alive, living in the [[Mountains of Ararat]], and over nine centuries old at the time of her birth. No details are given as to her life or her religious beliefs before Abraham's return to Ur Ka\u015bdim to thwart Nimrod's efforts to proclaim himself a god. It is known she wed Abraham, then Abram, sometime between the ages of forty and five and following her husband's public humiliation of Nimrod, she, along with her father Terah, her orphaned nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], her manservant [[Eliezer]], and some three hundred others left Ur Ka\u015bdim for [[Canaan]], the present-day [[Levant]], to save Abraham from a plot by Nimrod to destroy him, commanded to do so by [[Yahweh]].\n\nEn route to Canaan, the group stopped in [[Harran]], in present-day Turkey, settling there for some twenty years, until Yahweh urged them to move on and so, they left Terah behind, to live out his days, and traveled through [[Shechem]] and [[Bethel]], both cities in the present-day [[West Bank]], and, when a [[famine]] strikes the region, to [[Mizraim]], present-day [[Egypt]]. While in Mizraim, Sarah's beauty attracts the attention of [[Pharaoh]] and Abraham, fearing the Egyptians would kill him if they knew Sarah were married to him, introduces himself as her brother and so, Pharaoh bestows upon Abraham great wealth, in the form of [[livestock]] and [[Slavery|slaves]], including [[Hagar]], so that he may take Sarah as his [[Concubinage|concubine]], to live in his palace with him. For Pharaoh's unintentional transgression against Abraham, he and members of his household, save for Sarah, are stricken with plague. Pharaoh then realizes that Abraham is Sarah's husband, not only her brother. Despite Abraham's willful deceit of Pharaoh, Pharaoh does not punish Abraham nor does he require the return of the wealth Abram was given in exchange for Sarah. However, he orders them to leave Mizraim. After leaving Mizraim, Lot splits from their group amicably. He eventually settles in [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]], over disputes related to the livestock.\n\nThey returned to [[Canaan]], and a decade passed and still, she and Abraham had no children. Thus, Sarah offered Hagar, her slavewoman, as a concubine to her husband so that he may have a child. Hagar became pregnant with [[Ishmael]]. During Hagar's pregnancy, Sarah and Hagar's relationship deteriorated rapidly, with Sarah striking her and Hagar fleeing into the desert to avoid her, returning only at the urging of angels. Yahweh then told Abraham that Sarah would give to him a son. Sarah, then ninety years old, laughed at this idea. But, as prophesied, she became pregnant with [[Isaac]] and she nursed him herself. She would ultimately demand that Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael away and so, Abraham banished them and sent them into the desert.\n\nSometime after the birth of Ishmael but before the birth of Isaac, Sarah and Abraham travel to [[Gerar]], as described in Genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of Mizraim, in which a king, this time [[Abimelech]], took an interest in Sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in Mizraim, Abraham presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried Abimelech took her into her house as Pharaoh had though, this time, Yahweh intervened before he touched Sarah, through dreams and plague. Abimelech confronted Abraham, angry that his lie had caused him to provoke the wrath of a god, but, also like Pharaoh, he bestows great wealth upon Abraham. The two men part amicably, with Abraham saying he will pray for the king, who is childless and without an heir.\n\nIt is said that Sarah died at the age of one hundred and twenty seven years, caused in part by the events of the [[Binding of Isaac]]. She is buried in [[Kiryat Arba]], in [[Hebron]], in the [[Cave of Machpela]].\n\n=== In Christianity ===\nLittle changes in the portrayal of Sarah from Judaism to Christianity, though a notable difference is seen in the portrayal of Sarah's relationship with the unnamed pharaoh. While Judaism accepts that the pharaoh and Sarah had sexual relations, Christianity holds the view that they did not. {{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== In Islam ===\nThe Islamic portrayal of Sarah, who is unnamed in the Quran, mimics that of her portrayal in Judaism and Christianity, in that she is a good woman, kin and wife to Abraham, who, after years of [[Infertility|barrenness]], is blessed with a son, the prophet Isaac. However, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael. She is not portrayed as Abraham's sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of Terah's brother, Haran, and Hagar is not portrayed as Abraham's mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that Sarah feels for Hagar during her pregnancy and toward Ishmael.<ref name=\"Arastu2\">{{cite book|url=http://www.shia-maktab.info/index.php/en/library?format=raw&task=download&fid=280|title=God and his Emissaries - Adam to Jesus|last=Arastu|first=Shaykh Rizwan|publisher=Imam Mahdi Association of Marjaeya (I.M.A.M.)|year=2014|isbn=97 8-0-6 92-21411-4|page=227}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VdTAAAAYAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Hagar|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|last=Lings|first=Martin|publisher=[[Islamic Texts Society]]|year=1983|isbn=978-0042970509|location=|page=|chapter=The House of God|authorlink=Martin Lings}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/296/story-of-abraham-part-5/|title=The Story of Abraham (part 5 of 7): The Gifting of Hagar and Her Plight|last=Mufti|first=Imam|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Abraham Family Tree}}\n\n== In rabbinic literature ==\n\nThe Talmud identifies Sarai with [[Iscah]], daughter of Abraham's deceased brother [[Haran]],<ref>Genesis 11:29</ref> so that in this Sarah turns out to be the niece of Abraham and the sister of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] and [[Milcah]].<ref>[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 69b</ref> While in Genesis 20:12 Abraham claims that Sarah \"is indeed my sister, my father's daughter\" rather than his niece, [[Rashi]]  asserts that the term \"daughter\" can also be used regarding a granddaughter, and thus \"sister\" can be used regarding a niece.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.20.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.20.12&lang2=bi Rashi to Genesis 20:12]</ref>\n\nThe fifth-century rabbinic midrash [[Genesis Rabbah]] dedicates a large amount of attention to Sarah in particular.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Rami|title=The Blessed Mother Sarah: The Figure of Sarah in Genesis Rabbah in Light of Christian Exegesis and the Rise of the Virgin Mary|url=https://www.academia.edu/34734363/The_Blessed_Mother_Sarah_The_Figure_of_Sarah_in_Genesis_Rabbah_in_Light_of_Christian_Exegesis_and_the_Rise_of_the_Virgin_Mary|language=en}}</ref> Not only are a relatively large number of [[Drasha|drashot]] dedicated to the matriarch, but she is repeatedly depicted as a model of personal and religious excellence.

Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her.<ref name=Yashar/> According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after she had told him that she was a married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her.<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 41:2</ref> According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: \"It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house.\" Abimelech acted likewise.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 45:2</ref> In Genesis 17:15, God changes her name to Sarah (princess) (\"a woman of high rank\") as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael.\n\n===Relations with Hagar===\n[[File:Foster Bible Pictures 0032-1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Abraham]], Sarah and [[Hagar]]'', imagined here in a Bible [[illustration]] from 1897.]]\nSarai treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also. Hagar, when pregnant by Abraham, began to act superciliously toward Sarai, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 45:9.</ref> Some believe Sarai was originally destined to reach the age of 175 years, but forty-eight years of this span of life were taken away from her because she complained of Abraham, blaming him as though he was the cause that Hagar no longer respected her.<ref name=RH16b/><ref>Genesis Rabbah 45:7.</ref> Sarah was sterile; but a miracle was granted to her<ref>Genesis Rabbah 47:3</ref> after her name was changed from \"Sarai\" to \"Sarah\".<ref name=RH16b>[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] 16b</ref> According to one myth, when her fertility had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]], the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, also, who brought their infants with them; and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the strange children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle.<ref>[[Bava Metzia]] 87a; compare Genesis Rabbah 53:13</ref>\n\n===Death===\nLegends connect Sarah's death with the attempted sacrifice of Isaac,<ref>Genesis Rabbah 58:5</ref> however, there are two versions of the story. According to one, Samael came to her and said: \"Your old husband seized the boy and sacrificed him. The boy wailed and wept; but he could not escape from his father.\" Sarah began to cry bitterly, and ultimately died of her grief.<ref>[[Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 32</ref> According to the other legend, Satan came to Sarah disguised as an old man, and told her that Isaac had been sacrificed. Believing it to be true, she cried bitterly, but soon comforted herself with the thought that the sacrifice had been offered at the command of God. She started from Beer-sheba to Hebron, asking everyone she met if he knew in which direction Abraham had gone. Then Satan came again in human shape and told her that it was not true that Isaac had been sacrificed, but that he was living and would soon return with his father. Sarah, on hearing this, died of joy at Hebron. Abraham and Isaac returned to their home at Beer-sheba, and, not finding Sarah there, went to Hebron, where they discovered her dead.<ref>[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]], section \"Vayera\".</ref> According to the [[Genesis Rabbah]], during Sarah's lifetime her house was always hospitably open, the dough was miraculously increased, a light burned from Friday evening to Saturday evening, and a pillar of cloud rested upon the entrance to her tent.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 60:15</ref>\n\n==New Testament references==\nThe [[First Epistle of Peter]] praises Sarah for obeying her husband.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|3:6|9}}, cited in {{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Sara}}</ref> She is praised for her faith in the Hebrews \"hall of faith\" passage alongside a number of other Old Testament figures.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:11|9}}</ref> Other New Testament references to Sarah are in Romans<ref>{{Bibleref2|Romans.4:19;9:9||9|Romans 4:19 and 9:9}}, cited in {{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Sara}}</ref> and Galatians.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Galatians|4:22-23|9|Galatians 4:22\u201323}}</ref> In [[Galatians 4]], she and Hagar are used as an allegory of the old and new covenants:\n\n\"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.

But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in  [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' (1974), and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first-millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were [[Iron Age]] creations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Megan Bishop |last2=Kelle |first2=Brad E. |authorlink= |title=Biblical History and Israel's Past |year=2011 |publisher=Eerdmans |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&pg=PA19#v=snippet&q=Thompson+%22Van+Seters%22&f=false |isbn=978-0-8028-6260-0 |page=}}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make the patriarchs and matriarchs credible historical figures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pardee |first1=Dennis |title=Review of The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |date=1977 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=222\u2013224 |jstor=545164 |doi=10.1086/372571}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dever |first=William G. |authorlink=William G.

Knowing Sarah to be a great beauty and fearing that the Pharaoh would kill Abraham to be with Sarah, Abraham asks Sarah to tell the Pharaoh that she is his sister (Genesis 7).\n\nShe was originally called \"Sarai\", a [[dialect|dialectal variant]] of \"Sarah\". In the narrative of the [[Brit milah|covenant of circumcision]] in Genesis 17, during which [[Yahweh]] promises Abram that he and Sarai will have a son, Abram is renamed as Abraham and Sarai is renamed as Sarah.

On the journey to Egypt, Abram instructed Sarai to identify herself only as his sister, fearing that the Egyptians would kill him in order to take his wife, saying, \"I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'this is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.\"<ref>Genesis 12:11-13, NIV</ref> When brought before [[Pharaoh]], Sarai said that Abram was her brother, and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. It is possible that Sarai acquired her Egyptian handmaid Hagar during this stay. However, God afflicted Pharaoh's household with great plagues.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:14\u201317|HE}}</ref> Pharaoh then realized that Sarai was Abram's wife and demanded that they leave Egypt immediately.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:18\u201320|HE}}</ref>\n\n===Hagar and Ishmael===\n[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. \u00c0 Paris chez Fr.

This resulted in tension between Sarai and [[Hagar]], and Sarai complained to her husband that the handmaid no longer respected her.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:1\u20136|HE}}</ref> At one point, Hagar fled from her mistress but returned after angels consoled her.

God gave Sarai the new name \"Sarah\", and blessed her.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:1\u201327|HE}}</ref> Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child \"[[Isaac]]\" (Hebrew yitschaq, \"laughter\") and circumcised him when he was eight days old.<ref>{{bibleref|Genesis|21:4|9}}</ref> For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"God had made me to laugh, ''[so that]'' all that hear will laugh with me.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Genesis|21:6\u20137|9}}</ref> Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned.

While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King [[Abimelech]] subsequently had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that was why he continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:1\u20137|HE}}</ref>\n\nEarly next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham replied that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Gen.|20:12|9|Genesis 20:12}}</ref> Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all.

She is born '''Sarai''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9) in [[Ur Ka\u015bdim]], or Ur of the Chaldees, believed to have been in present-day [[Iraq]], 1,958 years following [[Creation (Bible)|Creation]], according to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. She was the daughter of [[Terah]], an [[Idolatrous|idolater]] who worshiped the Moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham/The-Genesis-narrative-in-the-light-of-recent-scholarship</ref> and high-ranking servant of [[Nimrod]], the king of [[Shinar]], or [[Mesopotamia]], but not of his wife, Amathlai. Her name is a feminine form of ''sar'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05e8}}), meaning \"chieftain\" or \"prince.\" Through Terah, she would have been a 10th-generation descendant of [[Noah]], still alive, living in the [[Mountains of Ararat]], and over nine centuries old at the time of her birth. No details are given as to her life or her religious beliefs before Abraham's return to Ur Ka\u015bdim to thwart Nimrod's efforts to proclaim himself a god. It is known she wed Abraham, then Abram, sometime between the ages of forty and five and following her husband's public humiliation of Nimrod, she, along with her father Terah, her orphaned nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], her manservant [[Eliezer]], and some three hundred others left Ur Ka\u015bdim for [[Canaan]], the present-day [[Levant]], to save Abraham from a plot by Nimrod to destroy him, commanded to do so by [[Yahweh]].\n\nEn route to Canaan, the group stopped in [[Harran]], in present-day Turkey, settling there for some twenty years, until Yahweh urged them to move on and so, they left Terah behind, to live out his days, and traveled through [[Shechem]] and [[Bethel]], both cities in the present-day [[West Bank]], and, when a [[famine]] strikes the region, to [[Mizraim]], present-day [[Egypt]]. While in Mizraim, Sarah's beauty attracts the attention of [[Pharaoh]] and Abraham, fearing the Egyptians would kill him if they knew Sarah were married to him, introduces himself as her brother and so, Pharaoh bestows upon Abraham great wealth, in the form of [[livestock]] and [[Slavery|slaves]], including [[Hagar]], so that he may take Sarah as his [[Concubinage|concubine]], to live in his palace with him. For Pharaoh's unintentional transgression against Abraham, he and members of his household, save for Sarah, are stricken with plague. Pharaoh then realizes that Abraham is Sarah's husband, not only her brother. Despite Abraham's willful deceit of Pharaoh, Pharaoh does not punish Abraham nor does he require the return of the wealth Abram was given in exchange for Sarah. However, he orders them to leave Mizraim. After leaving Mizraim, Lot splits from their group amicably. He eventually settles in [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]], over disputes related to the livestock.\n\nThey returned to [[Canaan]], and a decade passed and still, she and Abraham had no children. Thus, Sarah offered Hagar, her slavewoman, as a concubine to her husband so that he may have a child. Hagar became pregnant with [[Ishmael]]. During Hagar's pregnancy, Sarah and Hagar's relationship deteriorated rapidly, with Sarah striking her and Hagar fleeing into the desert to avoid her, returning only at the urging of angels. Yahweh then told Abraham that Sarah would give to him a son. Sarah, then ninety years old, laughed at this idea. But, as prophesied, she became pregnant with [[Isaac]] and she nursed him herself. She would ultimately demand that Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael away and so, Abraham banished them and sent them into the desert.\n\nSometime after the birth of Ishmael but before the birth of Isaac, Sarah and Abraham travel to [[Gerar]], as described in Genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of Mizraim, in which a king, this time [[Abimelech]], took an interest in Sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in Mizraim, Abraham presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried Abimelech took her into her house as Pharaoh had though, this time, Yahweh intervened before he touched Sarah, through dreams and plague. Abimelech confronted Abraham, angry that his lie had caused him to provoke the wrath of a god, but, also like Pharaoh, he bestows great wealth upon Abraham. The two men part amicably, with Abraham saying he will pray for the king, who is childless and without an heir.\n\nIt is said that Sarah died at the age of one hundred and twenty seven years, caused in part by the events of the [[Binding of Isaac]]. She is buried in [[Kiryat Arba]], in [[Hebron]], in the [[Cave of Machpela]].\n\n=== In Christianity ===\nLittle changes in the portrayal of Sarah from Judaism to Christianity, though a notable difference is seen in the portrayal of Sarah's relationship with the unnamed pharaoh. While Judaism accepts that the pharaoh and Sarah had sexual relations, Christianity holds the view that they did not. {{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== In Islam ===\nThe Islamic portrayal of Sarah, who is unnamed in the Quran, mimics that of her portrayal in Judaism and Christianity, in that she is a good woman, kin and wife to Abraham, who, after years of [[Infertility|barrenness]], is blessed with a son, the prophet Isaac. However, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael. She is not portrayed as Abraham's sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of Terah's brother, Haran, and Hagar is not portrayed as Abraham's mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that Sarah feels for Hagar during her pregnancy and toward Ishmael.<ref name=\"Arastu2\">{{cite book|url=http://www.shia-maktab.info/index.php/en/library?format=raw&task=download&fid=280|title=God and his Emissaries - Adam to Jesus|last=Arastu|first=Shaykh Rizwan|publisher=Imam Mahdi Association of Marjaeya (I.M.A.M.)|year=2014|isbn=97 8-0-6 92-21411-4|page=227}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VdTAAAAYAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Hagar|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|last=Lings|first=Martin|publisher=[[Islamic Texts Society]]|year=1983|isbn=978-0042970509|location=|page=|chapter=The House of God|authorlink=Martin Lings}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/296/story-of-abraham-part-5/|title=The Story of Abraham (part 5 of 7): The Gifting of Hagar and Her Plight|last=Mufti|first=Imam|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Abraham Family Tree}}\n\n== In rabbinic literature ==\n\nThe Talmud identifies Sarai with [[Iscah]], daughter of Abraham's deceased brother [[Haran]],<ref>Genesis 11:29</ref> so that in this Sarah turns out to be the niece of Abraham and the sister of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] and [[Milcah]].<ref>[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 69b</ref> While in Genesis 20:12 Abraham claims that Sarah \"is indeed my sister, my father's daughter\" rather than his niece, [[Rashi]]  asserts that the term \"daughter\" can also be used regarding a granddaughter, and thus \"sister\" can be used regarding a niece.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.20.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.20.12&lang2=bi Rashi to Genesis 20:12]</ref>\n\nThe fifth-century rabbinic midrash [[Genesis Rabbah]] dedicates a large amount of attention to Sarah in particular.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Rami|title=The Blessed Mother Sarah: The Figure of Sarah in Genesis Rabbah in Light of Christian Exegesis and the Rise of the Virgin Mary|url=https://www.academia.edu/34734363/The_Blessed_Mother_Sarah_The_Figure_of_Sarah_in_Genesis_Rabbah_in_Light_of_Christian_Exegesis_and_the_Rise_of_the_Virgin_Mary|language=en}}</ref> Not only are a relatively large number of [[Drasha|drashot]] dedicated to the matriarch, but she is repeatedly depicted as a model of personal and religious excellence.

Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her.<ref name=Yashar/> According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after she had told him that she was a married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her.<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 41:2</ref> According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: \"It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house.\" Abimelech acted likewise.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 45:2</ref> In Genesis 17:15, God changes her name to Sarah (princess) (\"a woman of high rank\") as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael.\n\n===Relations with Hagar===\n[[File:Foster Bible Pictures 0032-1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Abraham]], Sarah and [[Hagar]]'', imagined here in a Bible [[illustration]] from 1897.]]\nSarai treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also.

Abraham thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, also, who brought their infants with them; and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the strange children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle.<ref>[[Bava Metzia]] 87a; compare Genesis Rabbah 53:13</ref>\n\n===Death===\nLegends connect Sarah's death with the attempted sacrifice of Isaac,<ref>Genesis Rabbah 58:5</ref> however, there are two versions of the story.

The boy wailed and wept; but he could not escape from his father.\" Sarah began to cry bitterly, and ultimately died of her grief.<ref>[[Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 32</ref> According to the other legend, Satan came to Sarah disguised as an old man, and told her that Isaac had been sacrificed. Believing it to be true, she cried bitterly, but soon comforted herself with the thought that the sacrifice had been offered at the command of God. She started from Beer-sheba to Hebron, asking everyone she met if he knew in which direction Abraham had gone. Then Satan came again in human shape and told her that it was not true that Isaac had been sacrificed, but that he was living and would soon return with his father. Sarah, on hearing this, died of joy at Hebron. Abraham and Isaac returned to their home at Beer-sheba, and, not finding Sarah there, went to Hebron, where they discovered her dead.<ref>[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]], section \"Vayera\".</ref> According to the [[Genesis Rabbah]], during Sarah's lifetime her house was always hospitably open, the dough was miraculously increased, a light burned from Friday evening to Saturday evening, and a pillar of cloud rested upon the entrance to her tent.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 60:15</ref>\n\n==New Testament references==\nThe [[First Epistle of Peter]] praises Sarah for obeying her husband.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|3:6|9}}, cited in {{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Sara}}</ref> She is praised for her faith in the Hebrews \"hall of faith\" passage alongside a number of other Old Testament figures.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:11|9}}</ref> Other New Testament references to Sarah are in Romans<ref>{{Bibleref2|Romans.4:19;9:9||9|Romans 4:19 and 9:9}}, cited in {{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Sara}}</ref> and Galatians.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Galatians|4:22-23|9|Galatians 4:22\u201323}}</ref> In [[Galatians 4]], she and Hagar are used as an allegory of the old and new covenants:\n\n\"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.

Albright]] and biblical scholars such as [[Albrecht Alt]] believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the \"[[patriarchal age]]\", the 2nd millennium BCE. But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in  [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' (1974), and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first-millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were [[Iron Age]] creations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Megan Bishop |last2=Kelle |first2=Brad E. |authorlink= |title=Biblical History and Israel's Past |year=2011 |publisher=Eerdmans |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&pg=PA19#v=snippet&q=Thompson+%22Van+Seters%22&f=false |isbn=978-0-8028-6260-0 |page=}}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make the patriarchs and matriarchs credible historical figures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pardee |first1=Dennis |title=Review of The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |date=1977 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=222\u2013224 |jstor=545164 |doi=10.1086/372571}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dever |first=William G. |authorlink=William G.

Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n===Rules===\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n==Griefing==\n[[Griefing]] on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n===Cheating===\nCheating on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n===Spam===\nSpam, including flooding, on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of speech===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]].\n\n==Hardware==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4&nbsp;GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moderation==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks. Usually, moderators are banning players online, and admins clearing what moderators missed by checking logs.\n\nEvery time the player breaks or places a block, the online staff gets a message in chat. Moderators or admins then teleport to the place player broke or placed a block at, asking player a few questions if needed.\n\nStaff also gets an alert every time a player is caught cheating.\n\nPlayers usually get a warning for the first time they break a rule, repeating the action can get the player banned.

Unlike most Minecraft servers, the world map has never been reset, making it the oldest running map in the game.\n\n==Rules==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n===Rules===\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n==Griefing==\n[[Griefing]] on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n===Cheating===\nCheating on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n===Spam===\nSpam, including flooding, on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of speech===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]].\n\n==Hardware==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moderation==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks. Usually, moderators are banning players online, and admins clearing what moderators missed by checking logs. \n\nEvery time the player breaks or places a block, the online staff gets a message in chat. Moderators or admins then teleport to the place player broke or placed a block at, asking player a few questions if needed. \n\nStaff also gets an alert every time a player is caught cheating.\n\nPlayers usually get a warning for the first time they break a rule, repeating the action can get the player banned. All bans are permanent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Moderator|title=Category:Moderators - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe next day the server was opened to the public, the first few players were promoted to moderators.

It dates to the 18th century and functioned as a public fountain. It is located a short distance west of the [[Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana}}), also completed in the 18th century. The building is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia.<ref name=\"a\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"n\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain dates to the early 18th century. The Senate of the Chamber of Salvador expropriated land belonging to Sergeant Major [[Jos\u00e9 Batista de Carvalho]] in 1724 to build a road to connect the fountain to the historic center of Salvador; the road remains as the Rua do Gravat\u00e1. It once supplied water to the neighborhoods of Mouraria, Palma, and Santana.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\nLu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena commented in 1801: \n\n<blockquote>Inside the city, just below the Church and Parish of Santa Ana, is the Fonte do Gravat\u00e1, the most filthy and worst of all; it is, however, the most frequented because it is the only public [fountain] within the city.<ref name=\"sipac\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Santa Casa da Misericordia (Salvador)|Santa Casa da Misericordia]] of Salvador claimed ownership of the fountain and its surrounding property in 1846; it lost the case in a court heard by municipal authorities. The city mandated an inspection and repair of all fountains in Salvador after a drought from 1883 to 1885; a reference to the Gravat\u00e1 Fountain appears in the report.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>\n\nWater testing was performed in the fountain in 2015 and it was found to be crystalline, with a moderate, continuous flow. The fountain is now used as housing by homeless people; it is polluted by human urine, organic, and inorganic pollutants.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located at the intersection of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata, a small street that leads up to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne. It is located below the second line of hills beyond the historic center of Salvador. The fountain, once located on a hillside, is located below the street level and is accessible by stairs. It is now surrounded by numerous homes of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain has a rectangular plan with a vault, crowned by a simple pediment. It is constructed of stone masonry. Similar to other fountains in Bahia, it is surrounded by an iron fence with a gate. It had two functioning spouts as late as the 1970s, similar to those reported by Lu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena in 1801.

It dates to the 18th century and functioned as a public fountain. It is located a short distance west of the [[Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana}}), also completed in the 18th century. The building is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia.<ref name=\"a\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"n\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain dates to the early 18th century. The Senate of the Chamber of Salvador expropriated land belonging to Sergeant Major [[Jos\u00e9 Batista de Carvalho]] in 1724 to build a road to connect the fountain to the historic center of Salvador; the road remains as the Rua do Gravat\u00e1. It once supplied water to the neighborhoods of Mouraria, Palma, and Santana.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\nLu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena commented in 1801: \n\n<blockquote>Inside the city, just below the Church and Parish of Santa Ana, is the Fonte do Gravat\u00e1, the most filthy and worst of all; it is, however, the most frequented because it is the only public [fountain] within the city.<ref name=\"sipac\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Santa Casa da Misericordia (Salvador)|Santa Casa da Misericordia]] of Salvador claimed ownership of the fountain and its surrounding property in 1846; it lost the case in a court heard by municipal authorities. The city mandated an inspection and repair of all fountains in Salvador after a drought from 1883 to 1885; a reference to the Gravat\u00e1 Fountain appears in the report.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>\n\nWater testing was performed in the fountain in 2015 and it was found to be crystalline, with a moderate, continuous flow. The fountain is now used as housing by homeless people; it is polluted by human urine, organic, and inorganic pollutants.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located at the intersection of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata, a small street that leads up to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne. It is located below the second line of hills beyond the historic center of Salvador. The fountain, once located on a hillside, is located below the street level and is accessible by stairs. It is now surrounded by numerous homes of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain has a rectangular plan with a vault, crowned by a simple pediment. It is constructed of stone masonry. Similar to other fountains in Bahia, it is surrounded by an iron fence with a gate. It had two functioning spouts as late as the 1970s, similar to those reported by Lu\u00eds dos Santos Vilhena in 1801. The catchment basin is shallow and slightly below the street level; the fountain has a [[decantation tank]] to regulate water flow.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Protected status==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is a protected structure by the [[Bahian Institute of Artistic Culture and Heritage]] (''Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Art\u00edstico e Cultural da Bahia'') under Decree no. 001/84 of 1984.<ref name=\"sipac\"/>\n\n==Access==\n\nThe Gravat\u00e1 Fountain is located on the corner of Rua do Gravata and Rua da Fonte do Gravata in a busy commercial district.

Northeast India (at the confluence of Indo-Malayan, Indo-Chinese, and Indian biogeographical realms) has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons, and mild winters. Along with the west coast of India, this region has some of the Indian subcontinent's last remaining rainforests, which support diverse flora and fauna and several crop species. Reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the region are estimated to constitute a fifth of India's total potential.\n\nThe region is covered by the mighty Brahmaputra-Barak river systems and their tributaries. Geographically, apart from the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], [[Barak Valley|Barak]] and [[Imphal]] valleys and some flatlands in between the hills of [[Meghalaya]] and [[Tripura]], the remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over {{convert|7000|m}} above [[Sea level|MSL]]. The region's high rainfall, averaging around {{convert|10000|mm|in}} and above creates problems of the ecosystem, high seismic activity, and floods. The states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Sikkim]] have a [[Montane ecology|montane]] climate with cold, snowy winters and mild summers.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gangtok ropeway.jpg|<center>Ropeway, [[Gangtok]]</center>\nFile:View of the ridgetop city of Aizawl, state capital of Mizoram.jpg|<center>[[Aizawl]], [[Mizoram]]</center>\nFile:Aerial view of Shillong Meghalaya India.jpg|<center>Aerial view of [[Shillong]]</center>\nFile:The Dzukou Valley.JPG|<center>[[Dz\u00fcko Valley]] (Borders of [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]])</center>\nFile:2007-sela-pass-1.jpg|<center>[[Sela Pass]], [[Tawang district|Tawang]] ([[Arunachal Pradesh]])</center>\nFile:Salna Bari, Bhalukpong.jpg|<center>[[Bhalukpong]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]]</center>\nFile:2 Loktak lake Manipur India.jpg|<center>[[Loktak lake]], [[Manipur]]</center>\nFile:Majuli Island.jpg|<center>[[Majuli|Majuli Island]], [[Assam]]</center>\nFile:Nohkalikai Falls.JPG|<center>Nohkalikai Falls, [[Cherrapunji]]</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===Topography===\n\n====Highest peaks====\n[[File:Kanchenjunga.JPG|thumb|220px|<center>Mt.

summer occur before the arrival of monsoons and thus eastern areas have the highest temperatures in June and July where the monsoon arrives later than western areas.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=155}} In the Cachar Plain, located south of the Brahmaputra plain, temperatures are higher than the Brahmaputra plain although the temperature range is smaller owing to higher cloud cover and the monsoons that

Two primitive variety of maize, Sikkim Primitive 1 and 2, have been reported from Sikkim (Dhawan, 1964). Although [[Slash-and-burn|jhum cultivation]], a traditional system of agriculture, is often cited as a reason for the loss of [[forest cover]] of the region, this primary agricultural economic activity practiced by local tribes supported the cultivation of 35 varieties of crops. The region is rich in medicinal plants and many other rare and endangered [[Taxon|taxa]]. Its high [[endemism]] in both [[Vascular plant|higher plants]], [[vertebrate]]s, and [[bird|avian]] diversity has qualified it as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].\n\nThe following figures highlight the biodiversity significance of the region:<ref>Hedge 2000, FSI 2003.</ref>\n* 51 [[Forest#Types|forest types]] are found in the region, broadly classified into six major types \u2014 tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests, tropical wet evergreen forests, subtropical forests, temperate forests, and alpine forests.\n* Out of the nine important vegetation types of India, six are found in the North Eastern Region.\n* These forests harbor 8,000 out of 15,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s.

Because of a southward occurrence of this mountain range in comparison to other Himalayan ranges, this region has a distinctly different climate, with warmer mean temperatures and fewer days with frost, and much higher rainfall. This has resulted in the occurrence of a rich array of restricted-range bird species. More than two critically endangered species, three endangered species, and 14 vulnerable species of birds are in this EBA. Stattersfield et al.

hub of different genres of music. Each community has its own rich heritage of folk music. Talented musicians and singers are plentifully found in this part of the country.

Another famous folk singing band from Nagaland popularly known as [[Tetseo Sisters]] is one to be noted for their original music genre. However, younger generation has started pursuing western music more and more nowadays. Northeast is witnessing immense rise of musical revolution in the 21st century. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Literature===\nMany of the Northeast Indian indigenous communities have an ancient heritage of [[Folklore genre|folktales]] which tell the tale of their origin, rituals, beliefs and so on. These tales are transmitted from one generation to another in oral form. They are remarkable instances of tribal wisdom and imagination. However, Assam and Manipur have some ancient written texts. These states were mentioned in the great Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]]. The [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]] is considered the first translation of the Sanskrit [[Ramayana]] into a modern [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan Language]].

With the development of this new policy, the Government of India directed its Look East policy towards developing the Northeastern region. This policy is reflected in the Year End Review 2004 of the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]], which stated that: \"[[Look East policy (India)|India\u2019s Look East Policy]] has now been given a new dimension by the UPA Government. India is now looking towards a partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [[ASEAN]] countries, both within [[BIMSTEC]] and the India-ASEAN Summit dialogue as integrally linked to economic and security interests, particularly for India\u2019s East and North East region.\"<ref>Year End Review 2004, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. New Delhi.</ref>\n\n===Development and connectivity projects===\nThe north-east (NE) region of India lags behind the rest of the country in several development indicators. Although infrastructure has developed over the years, the region has to go a long way to level up the national standard. The total road network of about 377 thousand km of NE contributes about 9.94 per cent of the total roads in the country. Road density in terms of road length per thousand km<sup>2</sup>. area is very poor in hilly state of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Sikkim, while it is significantly high in Tripura and Assam. The road length per 100 km<sup>2</sup> area in NE districts varies from as less as below 10&nbsp;km (in Arunachal Pradesh) to more than 200&nbsp;km (in Tripura). Other means of transport such as rail, air and water is insignificant in NE (except Assam); however, a few cities of these states having direct air connectivity in the region. The total railway network in the NE is 2602&nbsp;km (as on 2011), which is only about 4 per cent of the total rail network of the country. Constructions of roads build the road map for development and road is the only means of mass transport for the entire NE of India. Due to hilly terrain and varied altitudes, rail transport is mainly confined to Assam and water transport is almost non-existent.\nIndia's road network has benefited greatly from the articulation of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). The Ministry has formulated the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East (SARDP-NE) for the development/improvement of more than 10,000&nbsp;km roads in the NE states. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has been paying special attention to the development of national highways in the region and has assigned 10 per cent of the total allocation of fund for the NE region.\nAnother major constraint of surface infrastructure projects in the NE states has to be linked up with parallel developments in the neighboring countries, particularly with Bangladesh. The restoration and extension of pre-partition land and river transit routes through Bangladesh is vital for transport infrastructure in NE states. Other international cooperation, such as, revival of Ledo road (Stilwell road) connecting Ledo in Assam to northern Myanmar and extended up to Kunming in south-eastern China, Kaladan Multimodal Transit Project and Trans-Asian Railways, could open up an eastern window for the land-locked NE states of India. Various regional initiatives, such as, the Bangladesh\u2013China\u2013India\u2013Myanmar (BCIM) and Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), India\u2013Myanmar\u2013Thailand Trilateral Highway (IMTTH) project to link the markets of South and Southeast Asia, are in very initial stages.\n<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0974930614564648|title = Road Infrastructure in Economically Underdeveloped North-east India|journal = Journal of Infrastructure Development|volume = 6|issue = 2|pages = 131\u2013144|year = 2014|last1 = Nandy|first1 = S.N.}}</ref>\n\n* [[Ministry for Development of North Eastern Region#Projects|NE road, rail, air services, water, power, and tourism projects]] \n* [[India\u2013Myanmar barrier#Look-East connectivity|Look-East connectivity projects]] with [[ASEAN]] and [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of the Tennis Court]]\n*[[Laskar Committee Report]]\n*[[Ledo Road|Ledo Road (Stillwell Road)]]\n*[[List of Christian denominations in Northeast India]]\n*[[Literature from North East India]]\n*[[Political integration of India]]\n*[[History of Ladakh]]\n*[[List of indigenous peoples#South Asia| List of indigenous peoples of South Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources cited ===\n<!--- not looking to expand this list!

Northeast India (at the confluence of Indo-Malayan, Indo-Chinese, and Indian biogeographical realms) has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons, and mild winters. Along with the west coast of India, this region has some of the Indian subcontinent's last remaining rainforests, which support diverse flora and fauna and several crop species. Reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the region are estimated to constitute a fifth of India's total potential.\n\nThe region is covered by the mighty Brahmaputra-Barak river systems and their tributaries. Geographically, apart from the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], [[Barak Valley|Barak]] and [[Imphal]] valleys and some flatlands in between the hills of [[Meghalaya]] and [[Tripura]], the remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over {{convert|7000|m}} above [[Sea level|MSL]]. The region's high rainfall, averaging around {{convert|10000|mm|in}} and above creates problems of the ecosystem, high seismic activity, and floods. The states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Sikkim]] have a [[Montane ecology|montane]] climate with cold, snowy winters and mild summers.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gangtok ropeway.jpg|<center>Ropeway, [[Gangtok]]</center>\nFile:View of the ridgetop city of Aizawl, state capital of Mizoram.jpg|<center>[[Aizawl]], [[Mizoram]]</center>\nFile:Aerial view of Shillong Meghalaya India.jpg|<center>Aerial view of [[Shillong]]</center>\nFile:The Dzukou Valley.JPG|<center>[[Dz\u00fcko Valley]] (Borders of [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]])</center>\nFile:2007-sela-pass-1.jpg|<center>[[Sela Pass]], [[Tawang district|Tawang]] ([[Arunachal Pradesh]])</center>\nFile:Salna Bari, Bhalukpong.jpg|<center>[[Bhalukpong]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]]</center>\nFile:2 Loktak lake Manipur India.jpg|<center>[[Loktak lake]], [[Manipur]]</center>\nFile:Majuli Island.jpg|<center>[[Majuli|Majuli Island]], [[Assam]]</center>\nFile:Nohkalikai Falls.JPG|<center>Nohkalikai Falls, [[Cherrapunji]]</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===Topography===\n\n====Highest peaks====\n[[File:Kanchenjunga.JPG|thumb|220px|<center>Mt.

from the southwest and northeast [[monsoon]]s.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=150}}{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=151}} The Himalayas to the north, the Meghalaya plateau to the south and the hills of Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur to the east influences the climate.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}} Since monsoon winds originating from the [[Bay of Bengal]] move northeast, these mountains force the moist winds upwards, causing them to cool [[Lapse rate|adiabatically]] and condense into clouds, releasing heavy precipitation on these slopes.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}} It is the rainiest region in the country, with many places receiving an average annual precipitation of {{convert|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, which is mostly concentrated in summer during the [[Wet season|monsoon season]].{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}} [[Cherrapunji]], located on the Meghalaya plateau is one of the rainiest place in the world with an annual precipitation of {{convert|11,777|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}} Temperatures are moderate in the [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Barak River|Barak valley river]] plains which decreases with altitude in the hilly areas.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}} At the highest altitudes, there is permanent snow cover.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=152}}\n\n'''Temperature'''<br />\nTemperatures vary by altitude with the warmest places being in the [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Barak River]] plains and the coldest at the highest altitudes.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=153}} It is also influenced by proximity to the sea with the valleys and western areas being close to the sea, which moderates temperatures.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=153}} Generally, temperatures in the hilly and mountainous areas are generally lower than the plains which lie at a lower altitude.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=156}} Summer temperatures tend to be more uniform than winter temperatures due to high cloud cover and humidity.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=158}}\n\nIn the Brahmaputra and Barak valley river plains, mean winter temperatures vary between {{convert|16|to|17|C|F|0}} while mean summer temperatures are around {{convert|28|C|F|0}}.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=153}} The highest summer temperatures occur in the West Tripura plain with [[Agartala]], the capital of [[Tripura]] having mean maximum summer temperatures ranging between {{convert|33|to|35|C|F|0}} in April.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=155}} The highest temperatures in summer occur before the arrival of monsoons and thus eastern areas have the highest temperatures in June and July where the monsoon arrives later than western areas.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=155}} In the Cachar Plain, located south of the Brahmaputra plain, temperatures are higher than the Brahmaputra plain although the temperature range is smaller owing to higher cloud cover and the monsoons that moderate night temperatures year round.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=155}}{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=156}}\n\nIn the mountainous areas of Arunachal Pradesh, the Himalayan ranges in the northern border with [[India]] and [[China]] experience the lowest temperatures with heavy snow during winter and temperatures that drop below freezing.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=156}} Areas with altitudes exceeding {{convert|2,000|m|ft|0}} receive snowfall during winters and have cool summers.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=156}} Below {{convert|2,000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, winter temperatures reach up to {{convert|15|C|F|0}} during the day with nights dropping to zero while summers are cool, with a mean maximum of {{convert|25|C|F|0}} and a mean minimum of {{convert|15|C|F|0}}.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=156}} In the hilly areas of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, winters are cold while summers are cool.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=158}}\n\nThe plains in Manipur has colder winter minimums than what is warranted by its elevation owing to being surrounded by hills on all sides.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=157}} This is due to temperature inversions during winter nights when cold air descends from the hills\ninto the valleys below and its geographic location which prevents winds that bring hot temperatures and humidity from coming into the Manipur plain.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=157}}\n\n'''Rainfall'''<br />\nThe southwest monsoon is responsible for bringing 90% of the annual rainfall to the region.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=160}} April to late October are the months where most of the rainfall in Northeast India occurs with June and July being the rainiest months.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=160}} Southern areas are the first to receive the monsoon (May or June) with the Brahmaputra valley and the mountainous north receiving later (later May or June).{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=160}} In the hilly parts of Mizoram, the closer proximity to the [[Bay of Bengal]] causes it to experience early monsoons with June being the wettest season.{{sfn|Dikshit|2014|p=160}}\n\n===High risk seismic zone===\n{{See also|List of earthquakes in

[[India Plate]], [[Eurasian Plate]] and [[Burma Plate]]. Historically the region has suffered from two great earthquakes (M > 8.0) \u2013 [[1897 Assam earthquake]] and [[1950 Assam-Tibet earthquake]] \u2013 and about 20 large earthquakes (8.0 > M > 7.0) since 1897.<ref name=\"Frequent seismic activity\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/india-earthquake-north-east-manipur-state-tremor |title=North-east India hit by 6.7 magnitude earthquake |authorlink=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Shillong Plateau Earthquakes\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251244722 |title=Shillong Plateau Earthquakes |authors=Kayal, Hazarika and Kumar}}</ref> The [[1950 Assam-Tibet earthquake]] is still the [[List of earthquakes|largest earthquake in India]].\n\n==Wildlife==\n===Flora===\n[[File:A scene from Kanchenjunga National Park, Sikkim (1).jpg|thumb|220px|<center>[[Khangchendzonga National Park]]</center>]]\n[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] has identified the entire Eastern [[Himalayas]] as a priority [[Global 200]] [[Ecoregion]].

No such book here yet---> to include all the eight states of Northeast India, along with the neighbouring countries of [[Bhutan]], southern [[China]] and [[Myanmar]].\n\nThe region has been identified by the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] as a center of rice germplasm. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), India, has highlighted the region as being rich in wild relatives of crop plants. It is the center of origin of citrus fruits. Two primitive variety of maize, Sikkim Primitive 1 and 2, have been reported from Sikkim (Dhawan, 1964). Although [[Slash-and-burn|jhum cultivation]], a traditional system of agriculture, is often cited as a reason for the loss of [[forest cover]] of the region, this primary agricultural economic activity practiced by local tribes supported the cultivation of 35 varieties of crops. The region is rich in medicinal plants and many other rare and endangered [[Taxon|taxa]]. Its high [[endemism]] in both [[Vascular plant|higher plants]], [[vertebrate]]s, and [[bird|avian]] diversity has qualified it as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].\n\nThe following figures highlight the biodiversity significance of the region:<ref>Hedge 2000, FSI 2003.</ref>\n* 51 [[Forest#Types|forest types]] are found in the region, broadly classified into six major types \u2014 tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests, tropical wet evergreen forests, subtropical forests, temperate forests, and alpine forests.\n* Out of the nine important vegetation types of India, six are found in the North Eastern Region.\n* These forests harbor 8,000 out of 15,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s. In floral species richness, the highest diversity is reported from the states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (5000 species) and [[Sikkim]] (4500 species) amongst the North Eastern states.\n* According to the ''Indian Red Data Book,'' published by the [[Botanical Survey of India]], 10 percent of the flowering plants in the country are endangered. Of the 1500 endangered floral species, 800 are reported from Northeast India.\n* Most of the North Eastern states have more than 60% of their area under forest cover, a minimum suggested coverage for the hill states in the country in order to protect from erosion.\n* Northeast India is a part of [[Indo-Burma]] hotspot. This hotspot is the second largest in the world, next only to the [[Mediterranean Basin]], with an area {{convert|2206000|km2}} among the 25 identified.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Asiatic buffalo.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>[[Wild water buffalo|Asiatic Buffalo]] at [[Kaziranga National Park]]</center>]]\n[[File:One-Horned Rhino at the Kaziranga National Park, Assam.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>[[Indian rhinoceros|One horned rhinoceros]] at [[Kaziranga National Park]]</center>]]\n{{see also|List of amphibians of Northeast India}}\n\nThe [[International Council for Bird Preservation]], UK identified the Assam plains and the Eastern Himalaya as an [[Endemic Bird Area]] (EBA). The EBA has an area of 220,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> following the [[Himalayas|Himalayan range]] in the countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Nepal, Myanmar and the Indian states of [[Sikkim]], [[West Bengal|northern West Bengal]], Arunachal Pradesh, southern Assam, [[Nagaland]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Mizoram]]. Because of a southward occurrence of this mountain range in comparison to other Himalayan ranges, this region has a distinctly different climate, with warmer mean temperatures and fewer days with frost, and much higher rainfall. This has resulted in the occurrence of a rich array of restricted-range bird species. More than two critically endangered species, three endangered species, and 14 vulnerable species of birds are in this EBA. Stattersfield et al. (1998) identified 22 restricted range species, out of which 19 are confined to this region and the remaining three are present in other endemic and secondary areas. Eleven of the 22 restricted-range species found in this region are considered as threatened ([[Birdlife International]] 2001), a number greater than in any other [[Endemic Bird Area|EBA]] of India.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] has identified the following priority ecoregions in North-East India:\n: Brahmaputra Valley Semi-Evergreen Forests\n: Eastern Himalayan Broadleaved Forests\n: Eastern Himalayan Sub-alpine Coniferous Forests\n: [[Northeast India-Myanmar pine forests|India\u2013Myanmar Pine Forests]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===National Parks===\n{{see also|Wildlife sanctuaries of India|List of national parks of India}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:0.9em;background:#ffffff;\"\n!

hub of different genres of music. Each community has its own rich heritage of folk music. Talented musicians and singers are plentifully found in this part of the country. The Assamese singer-composer [[Bhupen Hazarika]] achieved national and international fame with his remarkable creations. Another famous singer from Assam, [[Pratima Barua Pandey]] is a well-known folk singer. [[Zubeen Garg]], [[Papon (Assamese singer)|Papon]], [[Anurag Saikia]] are some other notable singers, musicians from the state of [[Assam]]. [[Tangkhul Naga]] folk blue singer like [[Rewben Mashangva]], who comes from Ukhrul, is an acclaimed Folk singer whose music is inspired by the like of Bob Dylan and Bob Marley. Another famous folk singing band from Nagaland popularly known as [[Tetseo Sisters]] is one to be noted for their original music genre. However, younger generation has started pursuing western music more and more nowadays. Northeast is witnessing immense rise of musical revolution in the 21st century. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Literature===\nMany of the Northeast Indian indigenous communities have an ancient heritage of [[Folklore genre|folktales]] which tell the tale of their origin, rituals, beliefs and so on. These tales are transmitted from one generation to another in oral form. They are remarkable instances of tribal wisdom and imagination. However, Assam and Manipur have some ancient written texts. These states were mentioned in the great Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]]. The [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]] is considered the first translation of the Sanskrit [[Ramayana]] into a modern [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan Language]]. ''Karbi Ramayana'' bears witness to the old heritage of written literature in Assam.

Most of the writers, especially the tribal writers, are bilingual, that is, they write both in their mother-tongue and English. Some of the general features of this literature are\u2014retrieval of folklore, celebration of folk culture, identity politics, reaction to the insurgency and counter-insurgency operations, depiction of natural beauty, changes meted out by time, etc. The major writers of Northeast Literature are--(from Assam) [[Lakshminath Bezbaroa]], [[Homen Borgohain]], [[Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya]], [[Harekrishna Deka]], [[Rongbong Terang]], [[Nilmani Phukan]], [[Indira Goswami]], [[Hiren Bhattacharyya]], [[Mitra Phukan]], [[Jahnavi Barua]], [[Dhruba Hazarika]], [[Rita Chowdhury]], D N Bezbarua, Nilim Kumar, Anupama Basumatary, Uddipana Goswami, Anjum Hassan, Aruni Kashyap; (from Arunachal Pradesh) [[Mamang Dai]]; (from Manipur) [[Robin S Ngangom]], [[Ratan Thiyam]], Thangjam Ibopishak, Gambhini Devi, T Bijoykumar Singh; (from Meghalaya) Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih, Esther Syiem, Desmond Kharmawphlang, Paul Lyngdoh; (from Mizoram) Mona Zote; (from Nagaland) [[Temsula Ao]], Cherrie Chhangte, [[Easterine Kire]]; (from Sikkim) Sudha M Rai, Rajendra Bhandari (from Tripura) Chandrakanta Murasingh.

With 98 percent of its borders with China, Myanmar, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, Northeast India appears to have a better scope for development in the era of globalisation.<ref>Thongkholal Haokip,  ''[http://www.freewebs.com/roberthaokip/articles/India's_Northeast_Policy_Continuity_and_Change.pdf India\u2019s Northeast Policy: Continuity and Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428190348/http://www.freewebs.com/roberthaokip/articles/India's_Northeast_Policy_Continuity_and_Change.pdf |date=28 April 2017 }}'', Man and Society \u2013 A Journal of North-East Studies, Vol. VII, Winter 2010, pp. 86\u201399.</ref> As a result, a new policy developed among intellectuals and politicians that one direction the Northeastern region must be looking to as a new way of development lies with political integration with the rest of India and economic integration with the rest of Asia and Oceania, with North, East and Southeast Asia, Micronesia and Polynesia in particular, as the policy of economic integration with the rest of India did not yield much dividends. With the development of this new policy, the Government of India directed its Look East policy towards developing the Northeastern region. This policy is reflected in the Year End Review 2004 of the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]], which stated that: \"[[Look East policy (India)|India\u2019s Look East Policy]] has now been given a new dimension by the UPA Government. India is now looking towards a partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [[ASEAN]] countries, both within [[BIMSTEC]] and the India-ASEAN Summit dialogue as integrally linked to economic and security interests, particularly for India\u2019s East and North East region.\"<ref>Year End Review 2004, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. New Delhi.</ref>\n\n===Development and connectivity projects===\nThe north-east (NE) region of India lags behind the rest of the country in several development indicators. Although infrastructure has developed over the years, the region has to go a long way to level up the national standard. The total road network of about 377 thousand km of NE contributes about 9.94 per cent of the total roads in the country. Road density in terms of road length per thousand km<sup>2</sup>. area is very poor in hilly state of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Sikkim, while it is significantly high in Tripura and Assam. The road length per 100 km<sup>2</sup> area in NE districts varies from as less as below 10&nbsp;km (in Arunachal Pradesh) to more than 200&nbsp;km (in Tripura). Other means of transport such as rail, air and water is insignificant in NE (except Assam); however, a few cities of these states having direct air connectivity in the region. The total railway network in the NE is 2602&nbsp;km (as on 2011), which is only about 4 per cent of the total rail network of the country. Constructions of roads build the road map for development and road is the only means of mass transport for the entire NE of India. Due to hilly terrain and varied altitudes, rail transport is mainly confined to Assam and water transport is almost non-existent.\nIndia's road network has benefited greatly from the articulation of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). The Ministry has formulated the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East (SARDP-NE) for the development/improvement of more than 10,000&nbsp;km roads in the NE states. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has been paying special attention to the development of national highways in the region and has assigned 10 per cent of the total allocation of fund for the NE region.\nAnother major constraint of surface infrastructure projects in the NE states has to be linked up with parallel developments in the neighboring countries, particularly with Bangladesh. The restoration and extension of pre-partition land and river transit routes through Bangladesh is vital for transport infrastructure in NE states. Other international cooperation, such as, revival of Ledo road (Stilwell road) connecting Ledo in Assam to northern Myanmar and extended up to Kunming in south-eastern China, Kaladan Multimodal Transit Project and Trans-Asian Railways, could open up an eastern window for the land-locked NE states of India. Various regional initiatives, such as, the Bangladesh\u2013China\u2013India\u2013Myanmar (BCIM) and Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), India\u2013Myanmar\u2013Thailand Trilateral Highway (IMTTH) project to link the markets of South and Southeast Asia, are in very initial stages.\n<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0974930614564648|title = Road Infrastructure in Economically Underdeveloped North-east India|journal = Journal of Infrastructure Development|volume = 6|issue = 2|pages = 131\u2013144|year = 2014|last1 = Nandy|first1 = S.N.}}</ref>\n\n* [[Ministry for Development of North Eastern Region#Projects|NE road, rail, air services, water, power, and tourism projects]] \n* [[India\u2013Myanmar barrier#Look-East connectivity|Look-East connectivity projects]] with [[ASEAN]] and [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of the Tennis Court]]\n*[[Laskar Committee Report]]\n*[[Ledo Road|Ledo Road (Stillwell Road)]]\n*[[List of Christian denominations in Northeast India]]\n*[[Literature from North East India]]\n*[[Political integration of India]]\n*[[History of Ladakh]]\n*[[List of indigenous peoples#South Asia| List of indigenous peoples of South Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources cited ===\n<!--- not looking to expand this list!

Sunkara has said he feels that \"all of our writers fit within a broad socialist tradition\", noting that the magazine does sometimes publish articles by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], but that such pieces are written from a perspective that is consistent with the magazine's editorial vision, saying that \"we might publish a piece by a liberal advocating single-payer healthcare, because they\u2019re calling for the decommodification of a sector; and since we believe in the decommodification of the whole economy, it fits in\". In terms of the sociological background of contributors, Sunkara acknowledged that they were mostly under the age of 35 and stated that \"there are a lot of grad students, young adjunct professors or tenured professors.

He also noted several features of the publication's editorial stance, namely its rejection of [[anti-communism]]; its skepticism regarding the possibility of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] being transformed into a social-democratic movement through internal pressure, advocating instead the formation of a mass-based independent labor party; criticism of the parties of the [[Socialist International]], which they argue have been responsible for imposing [[neoliberal]] [[austerity]] policies; and a conviction that the [[Nordic model]] of social democracy is ultimately not viable and that the only alternative to capitalism would be for militant labor and socialist movements to struggle to replace capitalism with socialism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1195/walking-the-tightrope/ |title=Walking the Tightrope |last=Creegan |first=Jim |date=22 March 2018 |website=[[Weekly Worker]]|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a profile of Sunkara in January 2013, commenting on the publication's unexpected success and engagement with mainstream liberalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Young Publisher Takes Marx Into the Mainstream|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/books/bhaskar-sunkara-editor-of-jacobin-magazine.html|date=January 1, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> In a 2013 article for ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'', [[Michelle Goldberg]] discussed ''Jacobin'' as part of a revival of interest in Marxism among young intellectuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/148162/young-intellectuals-find-marx=eschol |title=A Generation of Intellectuals Shaped by 2008 Crash Rescues Marx From History's Dustbin |work=Tablet |author=Michelle Goldberg}}</ref> Jake Blumgart, who contributed to the magazine in its early years, stated that it \"found an audience by mixing data-driven analysis and Marxist commentary with an irreverent and accessible style\".<ref name=\"Blumgart\">{{cite news|last1=Blumgart|first1=Jake|title=Jawnts: Giving socialism a good name|url=http://articles.philly.com/2016-02-08/news/70424478_1_socialism-fringe-publication|work=Philly.com|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=6 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Podcasts and YouTube shows ==\n*''Weekends'', hosted by [[Ana Kasparian]] and [[Michael Brooks]]\n*''The Dig'', hosted by journalist Daniel Denvir\n*''Jacobin Radio'', hosted by Suzi Weissman\n*''The Vast Majority'', hosted by ''Jacobin'' managing editor Micah Uetricht\n*''Behind the News'', hosted by journalist [[Doug Henwood]]<ref>{{cite web |title=A Warm Welcome to Behind the News |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2017/03/behind-news-doug-henwood-jacobin-radio-podcast |website=Jacobin |accessdate=2 December 2019 |date=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Cite web| last = Arrieta-Kenna| first = Ruair\u00ed| title = How the Cool Kids of the Left Turned on Elizabeth Warren| work = [[Politico]]| accessdate = 2019-12-10| date = 2019-12-08| url = https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/08/elizabeth-warren-jacobin-socialist-left-072693}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://jacobinmag.com/}}\n\n[[Category:Socialist magazines|Jacobin]]\n[[Category:American quarterly magazines|Jacobin]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 2010|Jacobin]]\n[[Category:Socialism in the United States|Jacobin]]\n[[Category:2010 establishments in New York City]]\n[[Category:American political magazines]]\n[[Category:Magazines published in New York City]]\n[[Category:Marxist magazines]]\n[[Category:Socialist newspapers published in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Catalyst (journal)|the Australian publication|Catalyst (magazine)}}\n{{Infobox magazine\n| title = Jacobin\n| image_file = File:Jacobin fall 2013 cover.jpg\n| image_size = 225px\n| image_caption = Issue 11/12 (fall 2013)\n| editor = [[Bhaskar Sunkara]]\n| editor_title = Publisher\n| paid_circulation = 40,000<ref name=\"circulation\">{{cite news |last1=Baird |first1=Robert |title=The ABCs of Jacobin |url=https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-abcs-of-jacobin-socialist-magazine.php |accessdate=8 September 2019 |work=Columbia Journalism Review |language=en}}</ref>\n| unpaid_circulation = 1,000,000+ (Online monthly)<ref name=\"circulation\" />\n| circulation_year = 2018\n| frequency = Quarterly\n| category = [[Politics]], [[culture]]\n| firstdate = Winter 2011\n| country = United States\n| based = New York\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| website = [https://jacobinmag.com/ jacobinmag.com]\n| issn = 2158-2602\n}}\n'''''Jacobin''''' is a [[democratic socialist]] quarterly magazine based in [[New York City|New York]] offering [[American left|American leftist]] perspectives on politics, economics, and culture.

He was possibly the son of [[Seqenenre Tao]] and [[Ahhotep I]] and the full brother of [[Ahmose I]], founder of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. His reign fell at the very end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. Kamose is usually ascribed a reign of three years (his highest attested regnal year), although some scholars now favor giving him a longer reign of approximately five years.<ref>Kim SB Ryholt, ''The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period'', Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, p.273. {{ISBN|87-7289-421-0}}</ref> \n\nHis reign is important for the decisive military initiatives he took against the [[Hyksos]], who had come to rule much of [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Ryholt273\"/> His father had begun the initiatives and, quite possibly, lost his life in battle with the Hyksos. It is thought that his mother, as regent, continued the campaigns after the death of Kamose and that his full brother made the final conquest of them and united all of Egypt.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===''Casus Belli''===\n[[File:WadjkheperreScarabPetrie.png|thumb|left|200px|Drawing of a scarab of Kamose by [[Flinders Petrie]].<ref>Flinders Petrie: ''Scarabs and cylinders with names'' (1917), [https://archive.org/details/scarabscylinders00petr available copyright-free here], pl. XXIII</ref>]]\nKamose was the final king in a succession of native Egyptian kings at Thebes. Originally, the Theban [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] rulers were at peace with the Hyksos kingdom to their north prior to the reign of Seqenenre Tao.<ref>Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.189. Librairie Arth\u00e9me Fayard, 1988.</ref> They controlled Upper Egypt up to Elephantine and ruled Middle Egypt as far north as [[Cusae]].<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 290\">James, T.G.H.  ''Egypt: From the Expulsion of the Hyksos to Amenophis I.'' in ''The Cambridge Ancient History,'' vol. 2, part 1, ed. Edwards, I.E.S, et al. p. 290. Cambridge University Press, 1965.</ref> Kamose sought to extend his rule northward over all of Lower Egypt. This apparently was met with much opposition by his courtiers. It appears that at some point, these princes in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] had achieved a practical ''modus vivendi'' with the later Hyksos rulers, which included transit rights through Hyksos-controlled [[Middle Egypt|Middle]] and [[Lower Egypt]] and pasturage rights in the fertile [[Nile Delta|Delta]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Cambridge 2:1 290\"</ref>  Kamose's records on the ''[[Carnarvon Tablet]]'' relate the misgivings of this king's council to the prospect of a war against the Hyksos: \n{{cquote|See, all are loyal as far as Cusae. We are tranquil in our part of Egypt. Elephantine [at the [[First Cataract]]] is strong, and the middle part (of the land) is with us as far as Cusae. Men till for us the finest of their lands. Our cattle pasture in the Papyrus marshes. Corn is sent for our swine. Our cattle are not taken away... He holds the land of the Asiatics; we hold Egypt...\"<ref name=\"gardiner\"/>}} \n\nHowever, Kamose's presentation here may be propaganda designed to embellish his reputation since his predecessor, Seqenenre Tao, had already been engaged in conflict with the Hyksos only to fall in battle. Kamose sought to regain by force what he thought was his by right, namely the kingship of Lower and Upper Egypt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The king thus responds to his council: \n{{cquote|I should like to know what serves this strength of mine, when a chieftain in Avaris, and another in [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], and I sit united with an Asiatic and a Nubian, each in possession of his slice of Egypt, and I cannot pass by him as far as Memphis... No man can settle down, when despoiled by the taxes of the Asiatics. I will grapple with him, that I may rip open his belly! My wish is to save Egypt and to smite the Asiatic!\"<ref name=\"gardiner\">Gardiner, Sir Alan. ''Egypt of the Pharaohs'', 1961, reprint Oxford University Press, 1979, p.166</ref>}} \n\nThere is no evidence to support Pierre Montet's assertion that Kamose's move against the Hyksos was sponsored by the priesthood of [[Amun]] as an attack against the [[Set (mythology)|Seth]]-worshippers in the north (i.e., a religious motive for the war of liberation). The ''Carnarvon Tablet'' does state that Kamose went north to attack the Hyksos by the command of Amun, but this is simple [[hyperbole]], common to virtually all royal inscriptions of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] history, and should not be understood as the specific command from this deity. Kamose states his reasons for an attack on the Hyksos was nationalistic pride. He was also likely merely continuing the aggressive military policies of his immediate predecessor, [[Seqenenre Tao|Seqenenre]].\n\n===Northern Campaign===\nIn Kamose's third year, he embarked on his military campaign against the Hyksos by sailing north out of Thebes on the [[Nile]]. He first reached [[Battle of Nefrusy|Nefrusy]], which was just north of Cusae and was manned by an Egyptian garrison loyal to the Hyksos.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\">James, T.G.H.  ''Egypt:  From the Expulsion of the Hyksos to Amenophis I.'' in ''The Cambridge Ancient History,'' vol. 2, part 1, ed. Edwards, I.E.S, et al. p.291. Cambridge University Press, 1965.</ref> A detachment of Medjay troops attacked the garrison and overran it.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\"/> The Carnavon Tablet recounted this much of the campaign, but breaks off there. Nonetheless, Kamose's military strategy probably can be inferred. As Kamose moved north, he could easily take small villages and wipe out small Hyksos garrisons, but if a city resisted, he could cut it off from the rest of the Hyksos kingdom simply by taking over the city directly to the north. This kind of tactic probably allowed him to travel very quickly up the Nile.<ref>Spalinger, Anthony J. ''War in Ancient Egypt.'' , Blackwell Publishing, 2005, p.3.</ref> A second stele also found in Thebes, continues Kamose's narrative again with an attack on [[Avaris]]. Because it does not mention [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] or other major cities to the north, it has long been suspected that Kamose never did attack Avaris, but instead recorded what he intended to do.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\"/> Kim Ryholt recently has argued that Kamose probably never advanced farther than the Anpu or [[Cynopolis]] [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] in Middle Egypt (around the [[Faiyum]] and the city of Saka) and did not enter either the Nile Delta, nor Lower Egypt proper.<ref>Ryholt, pp.172-175</ref> \n[[File:2e-stele-Kamose.jpg|thumb|150px|Kamose's second stela which records his victory against the Hyksos (Luxor Museum).]]\n\nAccording to the second stele, after moving north of [[Nefrusy]], Kamose's soldiers captured a courier bearing a message from the Hyksos king Awoserre [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apopi]] at Avaris to his ally, the ruler of Kush, requesting the latter's urgent support against Kamose. Kamose promptly ordered a detachment of his troops to occupy and destroy the [[Bahariya Oasis]] in the western desert, which controlled the north-south desert route. Kamose, called ''\"the Strong\"'' in this text, ordered this action to protect his rearguard. Kamose then sailed southward, back up the [[Nile]] to Thebes, for a joyous victory celebration after his military success against the Hyksos in pushing the boundaries of his kingdom northward from Cusae past Hermopolis through to Sako, which now formed the new frontier between the seventeenth dynasty of Thebes and the fifteenth dynasty Hyksos state.<ref>Ryholt, pp.173-175</ref>\n\nRyholt notes that Kamose never claims in his second stela to attack anything ''in'' [[Avaris]] itself, only \"anything belonging to Avaris (''nkt hwt-w'rt'', direct genitive) i.e., the spoil [of war] which his army has carried off\" as lines 7-8 and 15 of Kamose's stela\u2014the only references to Avaris here\u2014demonstrate:  \n\nLine 7-8: ''I placed the brave guard-flotilla to patrol as far as the desert-edge with the remainder (of the fleet) behind it, as if a kite were preying upon the territory of Avaris.''\n\nLine 15: ''I have not overlooked anything belonging to Avaris, because it (the area which Kamose was plundering) is empty.''<ref>Ryholt, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nThe Second Stela of Kamose is well known for recounting that a Hyksos messenger was captured with a letter from Apophis\u2014appealing for aid from the king of Kush against Kamose\u2014while travelling through the western desert roads to Nubia. The final evidence that this king's military activities affected only the Cynopolite nome, and not the city of Avaris itself, is the fact that when Kamose returned the letter to Apophis, he dispatched it to [[Atfih]] which is about a hundred miles south of Avaris. Atfih, hence, formed either the new border or a ''no-man's land'' between the now shrunken Hyksos kingdom and Kamose's expanding seventeenth dynasty state. Furthermore, Kamose states in his second stele that his intention in returning the letter was for the Hyksos messenger to inform Apophis of the Theban king's victories ''\"in the area of Cynopolis which used to be in his possession.\"''<ref>Ryholt, p.172</ref> This information confirms that Kamose confined his activities to this Egyptian nome and never approached the city of Avaris itself in his Year 3.\n\n===First Nubian Campaign===\n\nKamose is known to have campaigned against the Kushites prior to his third year since the Hyksos king directly appeals to his Kushite counterpart to attack his Theban rival and avenge the damage which Kamose had inflicted upon both their states. It is unlikely that Kamose had the resources to simultaneously defeat the Kushites to the south and then inflict a serious setback on the Hyksos to the north in just one year over a front-line that extended over several hundred kilometres.<ref>Ryholt, pp.182-83</ref>\n\n==Length of reign==\n[[File:VotiveBarqueOfKamose.png|thumb|left|250px|Illustration of a votive barque attributed to Kamose.]]\nHis Year 3 is the only attested date for Kamose and was once thought to signal the end of his reign. However, it now appears certain that Kamose reigned for one or two more years beyond this date because he initiated a second campaign against the [[Nubia]]ns. Evidence that Kamose had started a first campaign against the Kushites is affirmed by the contents of Apophis' captured letter where the Hyksos king's plea for aid from the king of Kush is recounted in Kamose's Year 3 Second stela:\n{{cquote|Do you see what Egypt has done to me? The ruler who is in it, Kamose-the-Brave, given life, is attacking me on my soil although I have not attacked him in the manner of all he has done against you. He is choosing these two lands to bring affliction upon them, my land and yours, and he has ravaged them.\"<ref>Ryholt, p.181</ref>}} \n\nTwo separate rock-inscriptions found at Arminna and Toshka, deep in Nubia, give the prenomen and nomen of Kamose and Ahmose side by side and were inscribed at the same time&mdash;likely by the same draughtsman&mdash;according to the epigraphic data.<ref name=Ryholt273/> In both inscriptions \"the names of Ahmose follow directly below those of Kamose and each king is given the epithet '''''di-\u02c1n\u1e2b''''', ''Given Life'', which was normally used only of ruling kings.

He was possibly the son of [[Seqenenre Tao]] and [[Ahhotep I]] and the full brother of [[Ahmose I]], founder of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. His reign fell at the very end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. Kamose is usually ascribed a reign of three years (his highest attested regnal year), although some scholars now favor giving him a longer reign of approximately five years.<ref>Kim SB Ryholt, ''The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period'', Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, p.273. {{ISBN|87-7289-421-0}}</ref> \n\nHis reign is important for the decisive military initiatives he took against the [[Hyksos]], who had come to rule much of [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Ryholt273\"/> His father had begun the initiatives and, quite possibly, lost his life in battle with the Hyksos. It is thought that his mother, as regent, continued the campaigns after the death of Kamose and that his full brother made the final conquest of them and united all of Egypt.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===''Casus Belli''===\n[[File:WadjkheperreScarabPetrie.png|thumb|left|200px|Drawing of a scarab of Kamose by [[Flinders Petrie]].<ref>Flinders Petrie: ''Scarabs and cylinders with names'' (1917), [https://archive.org/details/scarabscylinders00petr available copyright-free here], pl. XXIII</ref>]]\nKamose was the final king in a succession of native Egyptian kings at Thebes. Originally, the Theban [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] rulers were at peace with the Hyksos kingdom to their north prior to the reign of Seqenenre Tao.<ref>Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.189. Librairie Arth\u00e9me Fayard, 1988.</ref> They controlled Upper Egypt up to Elephantine and ruled Middle Egypt as far north as [[Cusae]].<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 290\">James, T.G.H.  ''Egypt: From the Expulsion of the Hyksos to Amenophis I.'' in ''The Cambridge Ancient History,'' vol. 2, part 1, ed. Edwards, I.E.S, et al. p. 290. Cambridge University Press, 1965.</ref> Kamose sought to extend his rule northward over all of Lower Egypt. This apparently was met with much opposition by his courtiers. It appears that at some point, these princes in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] had achieved a practical ''modus vivendi'' with the later Hyksos rulers, which included transit rights through Hyksos-controlled [[Middle Egypt|Middle]] and [[Lower Egypt]] and pasturage rights in the fertile [[Nile Delta|Delta]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Cambridge 2:1 290\"</ref>  Kamose's records on the ''[[Carnarvon Tablet]]'' relate the misgivings of this king's council to the prospect of a war against the Hyksos: \n{{cquote|See, all are loyal as far as Cusae. We are tranquil in our part of Egypt. Elephantine [at the [[First Cataract]]] is strong, and the middle part (of the land) is with us as far as Cusae. Men till for us the finest of their lands. Our cattle pasture in the Papyrus marshes. Corn is sent for our swine. Our cattle are not taken away... He holds the land of the Asiatics; we hold Egypt...\"<ref name=\"gardiner\"/>}} \n\nHowever, Kamose's presentation here may be propaganda designed to embellish his reputation since his predecessor, Seqenenre Tao, had already been engaged in conflict with the Hyksos only to fall in battle. Kamose sought to regain by force what he thought was his by right, namely the kingship of Lower and Upper Egypt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The king thus responds to his council: \n{{cquote|I should like to know what serves this strength of mine, when a chieftain in Avaris, and another in [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], and I sit united with an Asiatic and a Nubian, each in possession of his slice of Egypt, and I cannot pass by him as far as Memphis... No man can settle down, when despoiled by the taxes of the Asiatics. I will grapple with him, that I may rip open his belly! My wish is to save Egypt and to smite the Asiatic!\"<ref name=\"gardiner\">Gardiner, Sir Alan. ''Egypt of the Pharaohs'', 1961, reprint Oxford University Press, 1979, p.166</ref>}} \n\nThere is no evidence to support Pierre Montet's assertion that Kamose's move against the Hyksos was sponsored by the priesthood of [[Amun]] as an attack against the [[Set (mythology)|Seth]]-worshippers in the north (i.e., a religious motive for the war of liberation). The ''Carnarvon Tablet'' does state that Kamose went north to attack the Hyksos by the command of Amun, but this is simple [[hyperbole]], common to virtually all royal inscriptions of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] history, and should not be understood as the specific command from this deity. Kamose states his reasons for an attack on the Hyksos was nationalistic pride. He was also likely merely continuing the aggressive military policies of his immediate predecessor, [[Seqenenre Tao|Seqenenre]].\n\n===Northern Campaign===\nIn Kamose's third year, he embarked on his military campaign against the Hyksos by sailing north out of Thebes on the [[Nile]]. He first reached [[Battle of Nefrusy|Nefrusy]], which was just north of Cusae and was manned by an Egyptian garrison loyal to the Hyksos.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\">James, T.G.H.  ''Egypt:  From the Expulsion of the Hyksos to Amenophis I.'' in ''The Cambridge Ancient History,'' vol. 2, part 1, ed. Edwards, I.E.S, et al. p.291. Cambridge University Press, 1965.</ref> A detachment of Medjay troops attacked the garrison and overran it.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\"/> The Carnavon Tablet recounted this much of the campaign, but breaks off there. Nonetheless, Kamose's military strategy probably can be inferred. As Kamose moved north, he could easily take small villages and wipe out small Hyksos garrisons, but if a city resisted, he could cut it off from the rest of the Hyksos kingdom simply by taking over the city directly to the north. This kind of tactic probably allowed him to travel very quickly up the Nile.<ref>Spalinger, Anthony J. ''War in Ancient Egypt.'' , Blackwell Publishing, 2005, p.3.</ref> A second stele also found in Thebes, continues Kamose's narrative again with an attack on [[Avaris]]. Because it does not mention [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] or other major cities to the north, it has long been suspected that Kamose never did attack Avaris, but instead recorded what he intended to do.<ref name=\"Cambridge 2:1 291\"/> Kim Ryholt recently has argued that Kamose probably never advanced farther than the Anpu or [[Cynopolis]] [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] in Middle Egypt (around the [[Faiyum]] and the city of Saka) and did not enter either the Nile Delta, nor Lower Egypt proper.<ref>Ryholt, pp.172-175</ref> \n[[File:2e-stele-Kamose.jpg|thumb|150px|Kamose's second stela which records his victory against the Hyksos (Luxor Museum).]]\n\nAccording to the second stele, after moving north of Nefrusy, Kamose's soldiers captured a courier bearing a message from the Hyksos king Awoserre [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apopi]] at Avaris to his ally, the ruler of Kush, requesting the latter's urgent support against Kamose. Kamose promptly ordered a detachment of his troops to occupy and destroy the [[Bahariya Oasis]] in the western desert, which controlled the north-south desert route. Kamose, called ''\"the Strong\"'' in this text, ordered this action to protect his rearguard. Kamose then sailed southward, back up the [[Nile]] to Thebes, for a joyous victory celebration after his military success against the Hyksos in pushing the boundaries of his kingdom northward from Cusae past Hermopolis through to Sako, which now formed the new frontier between the seventeenth dynasty of Thebes and the fifteenth dynasty Hyksos state.<ref>Ryholt, pp.173-175</ref>\n\nRyholt notes that Kamose never claims in his second stela to attack anything ''in'' [[Avaris]] itself, only \"anything belonging to Avaris (''nkt hwt-w'rt'', direct genitive) i.e., the spoil [of war] which his army has carried off\" as lines 7-8 and 15 of Kamose's stela\u2014the only references to Avaris here\u2014demonstrate:  \n\nLine 7-8: ''I placed the brave guard-flotilla to patrol as far as the desert-edge with the remainder (of the fleet) behind it, as if a kite were preying upon the territory of Avaris.''\n\nLine 15: ''I have not overlooked anything belonging to Avaris, because it (the area which Kamose was plundering) is empty.''<ref>Ryholt, pp.173-174</ref>\n\nThe Second Stela of Kamose is well known for recounting that a Hyksos messenger was captured with a letter from Apophis\u2014appealing for aid from the king of Kush against Kamose\u2014while travelling through the western desert roads to Nubia. The final evidence that this king's military activities affected only the Cynopolite nome, and not the city of Avaris itself, is the fact that when Kamose returned the letter to Apophis, he dispatched it to [[Atfih]] which is about a hundred miles south of Avaris. Atfih, hence, formed either the new border or a ''no-man's land'' between the now shrunken Hyksos kingdom and Kamose's expanding seventeenth dynasty state. Furthermore, Kamose states in his second stele that his intention in returning the letter was for the Hyksos messenger to inform Apophis of the Theban king's victories ''\"in the area of Cynopolis which used to be in his possession.\"''<ref>Ryholt, p.172</ref> This information confirms that Kamose confined his activities to this Egyptian nome and never approached the city of Avaris itself in his Year 3.\n\n===First Nubian Campaign===\n\nKamose is known to have campaigned against the Kushites prior to his third year since the Hyksos king directly appeals to his Kushite counterpart to attack his Theban rival and avenge the damage which Kamose had inflicted upon both their states. It is unlikely that Kamose had the resources to simultaneously defeat the Kushites to the south and then inflict a serious setback on the Hyksos to the north in just one year over a front-line that extended over several hundred kilometres.<ref>Ryholt, pp.182-83</ref>\n\n==Length of reign==\n[[File:VotiveBarqueOfKamose.png|thumb|left|250px|Illustration of a votive barque attributed to Kamose.]]\nHis Year 3 is the only attested date for Kamose and was once thought to signal the end of his reign. However, it now appears certain that Kamose reigned for one or two more years beyond this date because he initiated a second campaign against the [[Nubia]]ns. Evidence that Kamose had started a first campaign against the Kushites is affirmed by the contents of Apophis' captured letter where the Hyksos king's plea for aid from the king of Kush is recounted in Kamose's Year 3 Second stela:\n{{cquote|Do you see what Egypt has done to me? The ruler who is in it, Kamose-the-Brave, given life, is attacking me on my soil although I have not attacked him in the manner of all he has done against you. He is choosing these two lands to bring affliction upon them, my land and yours, and he has ravaged them.\"<ref>Ryholt, p.181</ref>}} \n\nTwo separate rock-inscriptions found at Arminna and Toshka, deep in Nubia, give the prenomen and nomen of Kamose and Ahmose side by side and were inscribed at the same time&mdash;likely by the same draughtsman&mdash;according to the epigraphic data.<ref name=Ryholt273/> In both inscriptions \"the names of Ahmose follow directly below those of Kamose and each king is given the epithet '''''di-\u02c1n\u1e2b''''', ''Given Life'', which was normally used only of ruling kings. This indicates that both Kamose and Ahmose were ruling when the inscriptions were cut and consequently that they were coregents.<ref name=Ryholt273>Ryholt, p.273</ref> Since Kamose's name was recorded first, he would have been the senior coregent. However, no mention or reference to Ahmose as king appears in Kamose's Year 3 stela which indirectly records Kamose's first campaign against the Nubians; this can only mean that Kamose appointed the young Ahmose as his junior coregent sometime after his third year prior to launching a second military campaign against the Nubians.<ref>Ryholt, p.274</ref> As a result, Kamose's second Nubian campaign must have occurred in his Year 4 or 5.

The concept soon spread to the [[United Kingdom]], where it was encouraged by the [[Temperance Society]] as a morally acceptable alternative to the pub, and over 1,000 milk bars had opened nationally by the end of 1936. Milk bars were known in the United States at least as early as 1940 as evidenced by contemporary radio recordings.\n\nBy the late 1940s, milk bars had evolved to not only sell [[groceries]], but also be places where young people could buy ready-made food and [[non-alcoholic drink]]s, and could socialise. Milk bars often used to include [[jukebox]]es and [[pinball machine]]s (later upgraded to [[video game]]s), with tables and chairs to encourage patrons to linger and spend more money.\n\nThe milk bar as a social venue was gradually replaced by [[fast food]] franchises, such as [[McDonald's]], and [[shopping mall]]s.
