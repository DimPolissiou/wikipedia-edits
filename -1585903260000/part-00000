It was considered to have a realistic outlook of urban middle class on cinema in 1974, an era when potboilers were ruling [[Bollywood]], a genre which was later called the Middle Cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rajnigandha (1974) |publisher=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/rajnigandha-1974/article3942091.ece?source=ppc&gclid=CjwKCAjw75HWBRAwEiwAdzefxFVqWatbmnzOA_DmNV-bhf3vD_jESQe32vVeQ-jGnoqdQ4l6aXIXQhoChq4QAvD_BwE |date=September 27, 2012 |accessdate=2018-04-04}}</ref> The film was the first screen role of [[Vidya Sinha]] and first Hindi film of [[Amol Palekar]], both of whom went on to work with [[Basu Chatterjee]] in many films. Rajnigandha was remade into Bengali in 2012 as ''Hothat Shedin''.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nDeepa ([[Vidya Sinha]]) is a graduate student in Delhi who is in a long-term relationship with Sanjay ([[Amol Palekar]]), whom she plans to marry. Sanjay is a loquacious, humorous, and a good individual who is also rather lackadaisical and forgetful with no sense of punctuality.\n\nA job interview call from a college in Mumbai re-acquaints her with Navin ([[Dinesh Thakur]]) whom she had split up with under acrimonious circumstances. Navin is in every way the antithesis of Sanjay: He is very punctual and looks after her during her stay in Mumbai. Navin shows her the city and helps her with the job interview. This rekindles Deepa's feelings for him, and she finds herself torn between the two men and between her past and her present. Upon her return to Delhi, she feels that her first love (Navin) is her true love. She receives a letter stating that she has got the job in Mumbai. At the same time Sanjay comes to her house and tells her that he has got a promotion. Deepa then feels that she should forget the past and marry Sanjay.\n\n== Cast and Crew ==\n===Cast===\n* [[Amol Palekar]] <small>as</small> Sanjay\n* [[Vidya Sinha]] <small>as</small> Deepa Kapoor\n* [[Dinesh Thakur]] <small>as</small> Naveen\n* Veena Goud <small>as</small> Deepa's sister-in-law\n* Rajita Thakur<small> as</small> Ira\n* Master Chicoo\n* Manju Maini\n* Satya Prakash\n* [[Biswajeet]] (special appearance)\n* [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] (special appearance)\n\n=== Crew ===\n* ''Director'' : [[Basu Chatterjee]]\n* ''Producer'' : Suresh Jindal\n* ''Co-Producer'' : Kamal Saigal\n* ''Editor'' : G.

During one of their meetings at the \"Film forum\" (one of the leading film societies of [[Bombay]] at that time) Basu Chatterjee showed Palekar the story \"Yahi Sach Hai\" by [[Mannu Bhandari]] to read. Once Palekar finished reading it, Chatterjee showed him the script that had been written based on this story. He thereafter asked him if he would like to play the leading role in it.

It is based on the short story \"Yahi Sach Hai\" by noted Hindi writer [[Mannu Bhandari]].<ref>[http://marcelproust.blogspot.com/2007/06/rajnigandha.html Rajnigandha story]</ref><ref name=abhi>[http://www.abhivyakti-hindi.org/gauravgatha/2004/yahi_such_hai/ysh1.htm Yahi Such Hai] www.abhivyakti-hindi.org.</ref> The movie starred [[Amol Palekar]], [[Vidya Sinha]] and [[Dinesh Thakur]] in the lead.\n\n''Rajnigandha'' went on to win the Best Picture, the Popular Award and the Critics Award at the [[Filmfare Awards]] in 1975. It was considered to have a realistic outlook of urban middle class on cinema in 1974, an era when potboilers were ruling [[Bollywood]], a genre which was later called the Middle Cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rajnigandha (1974) |publisher=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/rajnigandha-1974/article3942091.ece?source=ppc&gclid=CjwKCAjw75HWBRAwEiwAdzefxFVqWatbmnzOA_DmNV-bhf3vD_jESQe32vVeQ-jGnoqdQ4l6aXIXQhoChq4QAvD_BwE |date=September 27, 2012 |accessdate=2018-04-04}}</ref> The film was the first screen role of [[Vidya Sinha]] and first Hindi film of [[Amol Palekar]], both of whom went on to work with [[Basu Chatterjee]] in many films. Rajnigandha was remade into Bengali in 2012 as ''Hothat Shedin''.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nDeepa ([[Vidya Sinha]]) is a graduate student in Delhi who is in a long-term relationship with Sanjay ([[Amol Palekar]]), whom she plans to marry. Sanjay is a loquacious, humorous, and a good individual who is also rather lackadaisical and forgetful with no sense of punctuality.\n\nA job interview call from a college in Mumbai re-acquaints her with Navin ([[Dinesh Thakur]]) whom she had split up with under acrimonious circumstances. Navin is in every way the antithesis of Sanjay: He is very punctual and looks after her during her stay in Mumbai. Navin shows her the city and helps her with the job interview. This rekindles Deepa's feelings for him, and she finds herself torn between the two men and between her past and her present. Upon her return to Delhi, she feels that her first love (Navin) is her true love. She receives a letter stating that she has got the job in Mumbai. At the same time Sanjay comes to her house and tells her that he has got a promotion. Deepa then feels that she should forget the past and get married to Sanjay.\n\n== Cast and Crew ==\n===Cast===\n* [[Amol Palekar]] <small>as</small> Sanjay\n* [[Vidya Sinha]] <small>as</small> Deepa Kapoor\n* [[Dinesh Thakur]] <small>as</small> Naveen\n* Veena Goud <small>as</small> Deepa's Sister-in-law\n* Rajita Thakur<small> as</small> Ira\n* Master Chicoo\n* Manju Maini\n* Satya Prakash\n* [[Biswajeet]] (Special Appearance)\n* [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] (Special Appearance)\n\n=== Crew ===\n* ''Director'' : [[Basu Chatterjee]]\n* ''Producer'' : Suresh Jindal\n* ''Co-Producer'' : Kamal Saigal\n* ''Editor'' : G.

In an interview in 2015 with S.M. Irfan on [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Palekar described the circumstances in which he made this switch to mainstream acting. During one of their meetings at the \"Film forum\" (one of the leading film societies of [[Bombay]] at that time) Basu Chatterjee showed Palekar the story \"Yahi Sach Hai\" by [[Mannu Bhandari]] to read. Once Palekar finished reading it, Chatterjee showed him the script that had been written based on this story. He thereafter asked him if he would like to play the leading role in it. Palekar, a trained artist from the [[J.J. School of Art|JJ School of art]] and a theater actor had at that time worked in two [[Marathi language|Marathi]] films including [[Shantata!

This was followed by a 15-day schedule in Delhi. However, after that the film's producer,  Suresh Jindal who was also a first time film producer struggled for the next two years to remaining funding. A potential distributor even offered finance for the film if it was reshot with a different lead actor.
