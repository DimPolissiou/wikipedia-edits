system previously implemented by the ARL competition from the 1990s (also used as the [[AFL final eight system|AFL finals system]]) to decide the grand finalists from the top eight finishing teams. All but two teams retained a top-eight position to feature in this season's finals series. The [[Brisbane Broncos]] made a return after finishing 12th in 2013, whilst the [[Penrith Panthers]] made their first finals appearance since 2010 and only the second time since 2004.\n\nBy the time of the [[2014 NRL Grand final]] list-determining preliminary finals, the top four finishing teams remained except for the 2nd-placed Sea Eagles, who'd been replaced by the 7th-placed Bulldogs.\n\n{|

system previously implemented by the ARL competition from the 1990s (also used as the [[AFL final eight system|AFL finals system]]) to decide the grand finalists from the top eight finishing teams. All but two teams retained a top-eight position to feature in this season's finals series. The [[Brisbane Broncos]] made a return after finishing 12th in 2013, whilst the [[Penrith Panthers]] made their first finals appearance since 2010 and only the second time since 2004.\n\nBy the time of the [[2014 NRL Grand final]] list-determining preliminary finals, the top four finishing teams remained except for the 2nd-placed Sea Eagles, who'd been replaced by the 7th-placed Bulldogs.\n\n{|

Browngardt, who grew up the youngest in a large family of eight children (his eldest brother Tom would go on to work as the show's film editor), based the character upon the various and often eccentric relatives who would often drop by and visit them, as well as aspects of his own personality. The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. The pilot was produced in 2008, then aired online in 2009 on Cartoon Network Video as part of ''[[The Cartoonstitute]]''.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\">{{cite web|last=Amidi |first=Amid |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/uncle-grandpa-by-peter-browngardt-24524.html |title=Uncle Grandpa by Peter Browngardt |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Akin to the ''[[Regular Show]]'' pilot, the ''Uncle Grandpa'' pilot was successful, but it had yet to have been [[Green-light|green-lit]] into its own series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the TV series ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' (based on the creatures that appear in the original short) aired on [[Cartoon Network]], but was not as well-received as the other ''Cartoon Network'' series at the time, and was eventually put on hiatus in February 2012.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/secret-mountain-fort-awesome-talkback-50297.html|title=\"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" Talkback|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Despite the failure, ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' went on to win several awards, including the coveted Crystal Award for \"Best Television Production\" at  [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], the first US-based production to do so.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> This helped boost Browngardt's profile in getting ''Uncle Grandpa'' greenlit as a series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> Another factor that contributed to the launch of the show was the redesign of the character by [[John Kricfalusi]], ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''{{'}}s creator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/john-k-draws-uncle-grandpa-76314.html|title=John K.

The children he visits have a problem of their own and Uncle Grandpa tries to help them through a series of chaotic and surreal misadventures. He is a clowny sort of person who sometimes eats inedible objects (paper, and mostly books). He drives/lives in a UG-2000 model robotic [[recreational vehicle|RV]] known as the Perpetual Persistence and is accompanied by a talking red [[fanny pack]] named Belly Bag, a green [[Stenonychosaurus|dinosauroid]] named Mr. Gus, a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] named Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and an anthropomorphic pepperoni [[pizza]] slice named Pizza Steve.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n{{main|List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters}}\n===Main===\n* Uncle Grandpa (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\"). Uncle Grandpa is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n* Belly Bag (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's talking red cyborg fanny pack and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is a UG-series robotic laser hammer named Samantha. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n* Mr. Gus (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2212 Mr. Gus is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n* Pizza Steve (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen')&nbsp;\u2212 Pizza Steve is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n* Giant Realistic Flying Tiger \u2212 A static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Tiny Miracle (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]])&nbsp;\u2013 Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2013 These two are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face. Beary has a positive outlook on life while Hot Dog Person is more gloomy. Each of their segments consist of the two of them trying something different for the first time (taking a bath, getting a haircut, etc.). Beary is always excited to try whatever they're doing, while Hot Dog Person is more reluctant as it seems every time he tries something new, something bad happens to him. Beary's excitement also leads to him being self-centered, as he is so wrapped up in his own emotions that he pays no attention to Hot Dog Person's plight.\n* Charlie Burgers the Ball-Loving Dog Next Door (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]])&nbsp;\u2013 A talking dog that befriends Uncle Grandpa and his friends. He can be well behaved and he enjoys going on adventures with Uncle Grandpa. His catchphrase is \"I love my ball!\"\n* Brother Santa Claus Grandpa (voiced by [[Bob Joles]] ) is the famous figure for Christmas and is revealed to be Uncle Grandpa's brother in the Christmas special. They have had a troubled relationship since 1983. His catchphrase is \u201cTry not to mess this up like you do everything else!\u201d\n*[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]])&nbsp;\u2013 A tag-along with Uncle Grandpa in his adventures.

He is usually seated next to Uncle Grandpa in his chair.\n* Xarna (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 An overly-muscular, masculine cyborg. She is on a mission to get some gas for the Mad Motorcycle. Her catchphrase is \"I don't like your mouth.\" She is a spoof of Xena the Warrior Princess and She-Ra.\n* Evil Wizard (voiced by [[Rob Schrab]])&nbsp;\u2212 A wizard that goes around trying to make everyone's day horrible by humiliating them but he actually makes their lives better. His catchphrase is \"Behold!

Her catchphrase is \"Beautiful Morning!\"\n\n===Human children and adults===\n* Belly Kid (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 A kid who has a big belly.

The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]].

He drives/lives in a UG-2000 model robotic [[recreational vehicle|RV]] known as the Perpetual Persistence and is accompanied by a talking red [[fanny pack]] named Belly Bag, a green [[Stenonychosaurus|dinosauroid]] named Mr. Gus, a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] named Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and an anthropomorphic pepperoni [[pizza]] slice named Pizza Steve.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n{{main|List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters}}\n===Main===\n* Uncle Grandpa (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\"). Uncle Grandpa is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n* Belly Bag (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's talking red cyborg fanny pack and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is a UG-series robotic laser hammer named Samantha. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n* Mr. Gus (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2212 Mr. Gus is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n* Pizza Steve (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen')&nbsp;\u2212 Pizza Steve is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n* Giant Realistic Flying Tiger \u2212 A static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Tiny Miracle (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]])&nbsp;\u2013 Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2013 These two are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face. Beary has a positive outlook on life while Hot Dog Person is more gloomy. Each of their segments consist of the two of them trying something different for the first time (taking a bath, getting a haircut, etc.). Beary is always excited to try whatever they're doing, while Hot Dog Person is more reluctant as it seems every time he tries something new, something bad happens to him. Beary's excitement also leads to him being self-centered, as he is so wrapped up in his own emotions that he pays no attention to Hot Dog Person's plight.\n* Charlie Burgers the Ball-Loving Dog Next Door (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]])&nbsp;\u2013 A talking dog that befriends Uncle Grandpa and his friends. He can be well behaved and he enjoys going on adventures with Uncle Grandpa. His catchphrase is \"I love my ball!\"\n* Santa Claus (voiced by [[Bob Joles]] ) is the famous figure for Christmas and is revealed to be Uncle Grandpa's brother in the Christmas special. They have had a troubled relationship since 1983. \n*[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]])&nbsp;\u2013 A tag-along with Uncle Grandpa in his adventures. Because of his condition, he is unable to talk, communicating only through groans. He is usually seated next to Uncle Grandpa in his chair.\n* Xarna (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 An overly-muscular, masculine cyborg. She is on a mission to get some gas for the Mad Motorcycle. Her catchphrase is \"I don't like your mouth.\" She is a spoof of Xena the Warrior Princess and She-Ra.\n* Evil Wizard (voiced by [[Rob Schrab]])&nbsp;\u2212 A wizard that goes around trying to make everyone's day horrible by humiliating them but he actually makes their lives better. His catchphrase is \"Behold! I am Evil Wizard!\"\n* Priscilla Jones (voiced by [[Lena Headey]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's nemesis with a British accent and is the main [[antagonist]] of the series who wants revenge on him for ruining her science project and rather than help her played hacky sack instead resulting in her getting second place in the science fair. She prefers to solve children's problems using simple practical solutions, the complete opposite of what Uncle Grandpa does. Her catchphrase is \"Beautiful Morning!\"\n\n===Human children and adults===\n* Belly Kid (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 A kid who has a big belly. He was first ashamed of it, but Uncle Grandpa taught him the best features of having a big belly.

He appears in \"Nickname\".\n* Mary (voiced by Pamela Anderson)&nbsp;\u2013 Mary is a nervous girl. She takes her driver's test, but fails. Uncle Grandpa takes her on a test and helps her pass. Uncle Grandpa gives her her own \"Freedom and Independence USA\" truck for passing her test. She appears in \"Driver's Test\".\n* Dennis (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dennis is a kid who wanted to finally pass his teacher's hard class and avoid going to summer school, until Uncle Grandpa comes and eats his homework and putting Dennis in danger of going to summer school.

Adam appears in \"Brain Game\".\n* Angry Man Johnson (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]])&nbsp;\u2013 Angry Man Johnson is a grumpy old man who hates Charlie Burgers.

Angry Man Johnson appears in \"Charlie Burgers\".\n* Austin (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]])&nbsp;\u2013 Austin is a kid who had a lot of imperfections so he asked Uncle Grandpa to turn him into a robot to become the most perfect kid, and to eliminate all imperfections.

Uncle Grandpa finds the jokes Shaq makes to be very funny.\n* Akira (voiced by Nancy Cartwright)&nbsp;\u2013 Akira is a Japanese kid who wanted to make the best action packed monster movie of all time.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.

It is part of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u201320 worldwide coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\nPuerto Rico started addressing the risks of an outbreak early on. The island took \"some of the most dramatic steps of any U.S. jurisdiction to control the virus,\" and \"several U.S. cities and states followed Puerto Rico\u2019s lead, imposing curfews and shutting businesses\" of their own.<ref>[https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241295696.html ''Puerto Rico seeks to suspend all incoming flights to battle COVID-19 spread.''] Jim Wyss. Miami Herald. March 18, 2020. Accessed 17 April 2020.</ref> On February 29, [[Puerto Rico]] governor [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]] established a task force to look into how the virus could affect Puerto Rico and to lay out plans on how to best mitigate any outbreaks. Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.
