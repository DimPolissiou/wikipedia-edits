Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he leaned toward believing that the Church knew that the document was inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the \"overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.\"<ref name=Prosser/>\n\nThis was the first instance of modern, scientific [[diplomatics]]. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, [[Reginald Pecock]]e, Bishop of Chichester (1450\u201357), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation must be a fake are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"[[fief]]\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).\n\n[[Pope Pius II]] wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the ''Donation'' was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to [[Charlemagne]] and its powers of the [[Keys of Heaven|keys]] to [[Primacy of Peter|Peter]]; however, he did not publish it.<ref>Pope Pius II (1883).

The Florentine chronicler [[Giovanni Cavalcanti (chronicler)|Giovanni Cavalcanti]] reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the ''Donation'', Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts \u2013 which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found \u2013 he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nLater, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. [[Wolfram Setz]], a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in [[political theory]] and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.<ref>[[Wolfram Setz|Setz, Wolfram]] (1976).

Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he leaned toward believing that the Church knew that the document was inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the \"overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.\"<ref name=Prosser/>\n\nThis was the first instance of modern, scientific [[diplomatics]]. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, [[Reginald Pecock]]e, Bishop of Chichester (1450\u201357), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation must be a fake are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"[[fief]]\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).\n\n[[Pope Pius II]] wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the ''Donation'' was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to [[Charlemagne]] and its powers of the [[Keys of Heaven|keys]] to [[Primacy of Peter|Peter]]; however, he did not publish it.<ref>Pope Pius II (1883).

The Florentine chronicler [[Giovanni Cavalcanti (chronicler)|Giovanni Cavalcanti]] reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the ''Donation'', Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts \u2013 which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found \u2013 he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nLater, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. [[Wolfram Setz]], a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in [[political theory]] and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.<ref>[[Wolfram Setz|Setz, Wolfram]] (1976).

Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family's practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the [[Book of Proverbs|Biblical Proverb 5:15]] \"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well\", and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast \"on nothing but urine and tap water\". Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine-therapy regimens that he devised to many thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published ''The Water of Life: A treatise on urine therapy'', which became a founding document of the field.<ref name=Atler>{{cite book|last1=Atler|first1=Joseph S.|title=Yoga in Modern India: The Body Between Science and Philosophy|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=181\u2013210|isbn=0691118744|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o6anlz6i71oC}}</ref><ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=John W.|title=The Water Of Life: A Treatise on Urine Therapy|date=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1446489925}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong's book sold widely, and in [[India]] inspired the writing of ''Manav mootra'' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: Urine therapy; 1959) by [[Gandhian]] social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference ''Shivambu Kalpa'', a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East.{{efn|''Shivambu Kalpa'' (''[[IAST|\u015aivambu]]'': [[Sanskrit]] for \"Water of [[Shiva]]\") is said to be a section of the larger work ''{{IAST|\u1e0camara Tantra}}'', which is described by practitioners of urine therapy as \"belong to the [[Puranic]] age\". According to Joseph Atler the 107-[[shloka]] ''Kalpa'' is not well attested or in wide circulation, and is most easily accessible through modern Indian books on urine therapy, where it is often attached as an appendix.}} They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in [[Yoga|Yogic]]-texts such as ''Vayavaharasutra'' by [[Bhadrabahu]] and ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradapika]]'' by [[Sv\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma|Svatmarama]]; and [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] texts such as ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', ''Bhava Prakasha'' and ''Harit''. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of ''sivambu'' (drinking one's own urine) and ''amaroli'' recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in ''Shivambu Kalpa''.<ref name=Atler/>\n\nUrine-therapy has also been combined with other forms of alternative medicine. For example, in her book ''Your Own Perfect Medicine: The Incredible Proven Natural Miracle Cure that Medical Science Has Never Revealed!'', Martha M. Christy describes homeopathic preparations of urine and their uses, and says that they are \"extremely potent\".<ref name=\"gardner\"/>\n\n==Modern claims and findings==\n\nAn exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971.

Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family's practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the [[Book of Proverbs|Biblical Proverb 5:15]] \"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well\", and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast \"on nothing but urine and tap water\". Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine-therapy regimens that he devised to many thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published ''The Water of Life: A treatise on urine therapy'', which became a founding document of the field.<ref name=Atler>{{cite book|last1=Atler|first1=Joseph S.|title=Yoga in Modern India: The Body Between Science and Philosophy|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=181\u2013210|isbn=0691118744|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o6anlz6i71oC}}</ref><ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=John W.|title=The Water Of Life: A Treatise on Urine Therapy|date=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1446489925}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong's book sold widely, and in [[India]] inspired the writing of ''Manav mootra'' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: Urine therapy; 1959) by [[Gandhian]] social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference ''Shivambu Kalpa'', a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East.{{efn|''Shivambu Kalpa'' (''[[IAST|\u015aivambu]]'': [[Sanskrit]] for \"Water of [[Shiva]]\") is said to be a section of the larger work ''{{IAST|\u1e0camara Tantra}}'', which is described by practitioners of urine therapy as \"belong to the [[Puranic]] age\". According to Joseph Atler the 107-[[shloka]] ''Kalpa'' is not well attested or in wide circulation, and is most easily accessible through modern Indian books on urine therapy, where it is often attached as an appendix.}} They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in [[Yoga|Yogic]]-texts such as ''Vayavaharasutra'' by [[Bhadrabahu]] and ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradapika]]'' by [[Sv\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma|Svatmarama]]; and [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] texts such as ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', ''Bhava Prakasha'' and ''Harit''. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of ''sivambu'' (drinking one's own urine) and ''amaroli'' recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in ''Shivambu Kalpa''.<ref name=Atler/>\n\nUrine-therapy has also been combined with other forms of alternative medicine. For example, in her book ''Your Own Perfect Medicine: The Incredible Proven Natural Miracle Cure that Medical Science Has Never Revealed!'', Martha M. Christy describes homeopathic preparations of urine and their uses, and says that they are \"extremely potent\".<ref name=\"gardner\"/>\n\n==Modern claims and findings==\n\nAn exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971.

Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate. \n\nDuring thaw, the ice content of the soil melts and, as the water drains or evaporates, causes the soil structure to weaken and sometimes become viscous until it regains strength with decreasing moisture content.

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://climatekids.nasa.gov/permafrost/|title=What Is Permafrost?|last=Doyle|first=Heather|date=April 9, 2020|website=NASA Climate Kids|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Study and classification of permafrost==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate. \n\nDuring thaw, the ice content of the soil melts and, as the water drains or evaporates, causes the soil structure to weaken and sometimes become viscous until it regains strength with decreasing moisture content.

Caliciviruses, influenza A, and enteroviruses (ex. Polioviruses, echoviruses, Coxsackie viruses) have all been preserved in\u00a0ice and/or permafrost. Scientists have determined three characteristics necessary for a virus to successfully preserve in ice: high abundance, ability to transport in ice, and ability to resume disease cycles upon being released from ice. A direct infection from permafrost or ice to humans has not been demonstrated; such viruses are typically spread through other organisms or abiotic mechanisms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA study of late Pleistocene Siberian permafrost samples from Kolyma Lowland (an east siberian lowland) used DNA isolation and gene cloning (specifically 16S rRNA genes) to determine which phyla these microorganisms belonged to.

This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds.

It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.\n\n===Construction on permafrost===\nBuilding on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1\u20132 metres/3.3\u20136.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.<ref name=\"ASCE\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Clarke\n | first = Edwin S.\n | title = Permafrost Foundations\u2014State of the Practice\n | work = Monograph Series\n | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O-voTug5apsC&pg=PA34\n | isbn = 978-0-7844-0947-3}}\n</ref> The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called \"[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]\".\n\nThe [[Melnikov Permafrost Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more.
