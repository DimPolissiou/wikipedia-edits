The market was spread over nearly 500 [[bigha]]s and the residential area covered another 400 bighas.

As they were nomadic, they traveled from one place to the other by hacking their way through the virgin forests. They also cultivated land for their staple food but soon left the place after harvest time in search of a better place to cultivate. They also had the wide area of hunting ground where at the end of the day, they brought home speared wild boar, deer or monkeys. The implements they had were crude but obviously the bow and arrow were used both in hunting and fishing. The waters then were crystal pure and were untarnished by the changing current ecology. In some certain sites, Bansalan had patches of cogonal land interspersed with tall trees demarcated by serene creeks and turbulent rivers gushing from the belly of Mount Apo, the highest mountain peak in the Philippines where according to legend, Apo Sandawa ruled as god.\n\nIn early times, the Bagobo society was divided into datus or the chieftains, freemen, and slaves. The datus interpret customary laws. Marriages were arranged, the groom's parents selecting the bride and negotiating the match. A bride-price is paid according to their wealth, and the bride's parents also give a present equal to about half this amount to dispel the idea that they're selling their daughter. The groom has to serve the bride's family both before and after the wedding. The two-to three-day wedding ceremony takes place in the bride's home and ends with the bride and groom feeding each other a handful of rice. Young men strived to attain the rank of magani, a warrior class whose members had killed more than one enemy and were entitled to wear distinctive red clothing. A communal spirit prevailed, with everyone helping in house-building and cultivation.\n\nThe inhabitants in this early settlement venerated the anitos and their religion is a pantheon of innumerable gimokods (spirits), knowledge of which resides in old men and women known as mabalian.\n\nThe Bagobos celebrate Gin-Em festival which displays gratitude to the spirits for success in war or domestic matters, or for warding-off sickness, evil spirits, or danger. Two bamboo poles are erected in the house of a datu, then offerings are made, and a chicken is sacrificed. In former times, enemy skulls would be attached to the poles, and a slave sacrificed. Each magani relates his past exploits, and dancing, chanting of old songs and poems, feasting, and drinking fermented sugarcane wine continue till daybreak.\n\nThe Bagobos produce baskets trimmed with beads and fibers, ornate weapons, and inlaid metal boxes finished with bells. A metal box where they kept betel nuts is inseparable.\n\nBansalan was the name of the simple farmer who one day dug the earth in search of potable water to quench his thirst. Fortunately, he dug a well-spring, and did not only satisfy his thirst but also called his other companions to share his discovery. Rain widened the spring and the constant erosion of soil led its transformation into a creek, and later into a river. Unfortunately, Bansalan, the farmer did not live long. His companions who were the recipients of Bansalan's daring adventures named that the river after him and later also became the name of the fledgling village. President Elpidio Querino proclaimed Bansalan as a regular town on September 18, 1952, including two booming villages of Matanao and Kialeg in the south-west and western part of Bansalan which later became regular towns.\n\nDavao del Sur and parts of Northern Cotabato were established by good-natured relationships of the chieftains. In the beginning of the 20th century, Datu Tumunas of Bansalan launched feeder road constructions with the help of his own tribe people. Tumunas succeeded in linking Bansalan with Digos, ushering in the establishment of a harmonious relation between the Bagobos and the Kalagans, the natives of Digos. The friendship has expanded by leaps and bounds when they encouraged constant \"tabo\" or market following the old system of \"ukom\" or barter. Datus of neighboring places came to Bansalan to establish friendly relations with Datu Tumunas. Among them were Datu Julian and Datu Akwas. Later Datu Siman of Kidapawan succeeded in constructing a road linking the place with Bansalan. More friendly relations were established as the road construction increased.\"\n\nBansalan is situated at the north-western part of the Province of Davao del Sur. Towards the south is the Municipality of Matanao, to the west is the Municipality of Magsaysay, to the southeast is the Municipality of Digos and on the north-east lies the Mt. Apo National Park. Its total land area is 48,548 hectares and divided into 23 villages or barrios where the Poblacion is the main center.\n\nThe Poblacion serves as the nerve-center of the town where all the schools, churches of different denominations, market, cinema, sports facilities, and other amenities are located. It is highly agricultural and most of the active young people work in Digos which now became the capital town of Davao del Sur. There are about 55,000 people living in the whole town including the villages.\n\nIn the early 1950s, a big number of migrants from other parts of the country but mainly from Cebu settled in Bansalan which drastically changed the lives of the Bagobos, the native inhabitants of the place. The Bagobos retreated to the hinterlands, and the settlers took over the running and further development of the town. At present, not one public official is a native Bagobo, the tribe which was responsible in the establishment of the town. What remained is the name of Datu Bansalan but his daring adventures are already long forgotten by the town people. Town anniversaries are celebrated with grand fiestas and parades but Datu Bansalan is no longer remembered in the history nor given an appropriate celebration in honor of his founding the town. People remember the date Pres. Quirino officially proclaimed Bansalan as a regular town as if the history of the town only started in September 1952.\n\nIn 1957, the barrios of Kibao, San Vicente, Kibuaya, Managa Km. 67, Sinawilan, New Visayas, Sacub, Upper Malabang, Temongbong, Sinaragan, Maliit Digos, Kapok, Tamlangon, Manga, Buas, New Katipunan, Da-Anama, Upper Kauswagan, Kagaulas, Kabasagan, Tuwak, Mal, Latian, Lanturi, Dongang-Pekong, La Union, Kauswagan and Paitan were separated from said municipality, and constituted into a new and independent municipality known as [[Matanao, Davao del Sur|Matanao]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1902.html |title=R.A.

As they were nomadic, they traveled from one place to the other by hacking their way through the virgin forests. They also cultivated land for their staple food but soon left the place after harvest time in search of a better place to cultivate. They also had the wide area of hunting ground where at the end of the day, they brought home speared wild boar, deer or monkeys. The implements they had were crude but obviously the bow and arrow were used both in hunting and fishing. The waters then were crystal pure and were untarnished by the changing current ecology. In some certain sites, Bansalan had patches of cogonal land interspersed with tall trees demarcated by serene creeks and turbulent rivers gushing from the belly of Mount Apo, the highest mountain peak in the Philippines where according to legend, Apo Sandawa ruled as god.\n\nIn early times, the Bagobo society was divided into datus or the chieftains, freemen, and slaves. The datus interpret customary laws. Marriages were arranged, the groom's parents selecting the bride and negotiating the match. A bride-price is paid according to their wealth, and the bride's parents also give a present equal to about half this amount to dispel the idea that they're selling their daughter. The groom has to serve the bride's family both before and after the wedding. The two-to three-day wedding ceremony takes place in the bride's home and ends with the bride and groom feeding each other a handful of rice. Young men strived to attain the rank of magani, a warrior class whose members had killed more than one enemy and were entitled to wear distinctive red clothing. A communal spirit prevailed, with everyone helping in house-building and cultivation.\n\nThe inhabitants in this early settlement venerated the anitos and their religion is a pantheon of innumerable gimokods (spirits), knowledge of which resides in old men and women known as mabalian.\n\nThe Bagobos celebrate Gin-Em festival which displays gratitude to the spirits for success in war or domestic matters, or for warding-off sickness, evil spirits, or danger. Two bamboo poles are erected in the house of a datu, then offerings are made, and a chicken is sacrificed. In former times, enemy skulls would be attached to the poles, and a slave sacrificed. Each magani relates his past exploits, and dancing, chanting of old songs and poems, feasting, and drinking fermented sugarcane wine continue till daybreak.\n\nThe Bagobos produce baskets trimmed with beads and fibers, ornate weapons, and inlaid metal boxes finished with bells. A metal box where they kept betel nuts is inseparable.\n\nBansalan was the name of the simple farmer who one day dug the earth in search of potable water to quench his thirst. Fortunately, he dug a well-spring, and did not only satisfy his thirst but also called his other companions to share his discovery. Rain widened the spring and the constant erosion of soil led its transformation into a creek, and later into a river. Unfortunately, Bansalan, the farmer did not live long. His companions who were the recipients of Bansalan's daring adventures named that the river after him and later also became the name of the fledgling village. President Elpidio Querino proclaimed Bansalan as a regular town on September 18, 1952, including two booming villages of Matanao and Kialeg in the south-west and western part of Bansalan which later became regular towns.\n\nDavao del Sur and parts of Northern Cotabato were established by good-natured relationships of the chieftains. In the beginning of the 20th century, Datu Tumunas of Bansalan launched feeder road constructions with the help of his own tribe people. Tumunas succeeded in linking Bansalan with Digos, ushering in the establishment of a harmonious relation between the Bagobos and the Kalagans, the natives of Digos. The friendship has expanded by leaps and bounds when they encouraged constant \"tabo\" or market following the old system of \"ukom\" or barter. Datus of neighboring places came to Bansalan to establish friendly relations with Datu Tumunas. Among them were Datu Julian and Datu Akwas. Later Datu Siman of Kidapawan succeeded in constructing a road linking the place with Bansalan. More friendly relations were established as the road construction increased.\"\n\nBansalan is situated at the north-western part of the Province of Davao del Sur. Towards the south is the Municipality of Matanao, to the west is the Municipality of Magsaysay, to the southeast is the Municipality of Digos and on the north-east lies the Mt. Apo National Park. Its total land area is 48,548 hectares and divided into 23 villages or barrios where the Poblacion is the main center.\n\nThe Poblacion serves as the nerve-center of the town where all the schools, churches of different denominations, market, cinema, sports facilities, and other amenities are located. It is highly agricultural and most of the active young people work in Digos which now became the capital town of Davao del Sur. There are about 55,000 people living in the whole town including the villages.\n\nIn the early 1950s, a big number of migrants from other parts of the country but mainly from Cebu settled in Bansalan which drastically changed the lives of the Bagobos, the native inhabitants of the place. The Bagobos retreated to the hinterlands, and the settlers took over the running and further development of the town. At present, not one public official is a native Bagobo, the tribe which was responsible in the establishment of the town. What remained is the name of Datu Bansalan but his daring adventures are already long forgotten by the town people.

Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the [[Allahabad High Court]] and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. A committed nationalist since his teenage years, he became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s. He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the [[Indian National Congress]] during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Gandhi. As [[Congress President]] in 1929, Nehru called for [[Purna Swaraj|complete independence]] from the [[British Raj]] and instigated the Congress's decisive shift towards the left.\n\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s as the country moved towards independence. His idea of a [[Secular state|secular nation-state]] was seemingly validated when the Congress swept the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 provincial elections]] and formed the government in several provinces; on the other hand, the separatist [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] fared much poorer. But these achievements were severely compromised in the aftermath of the [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942, which saw the British effectively crush the Congress as a political organisation. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, for he had desired to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort during [[World War II]], came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League under his old Congress colleague and now opponent, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], had come to dominate Muslim politics in India. Negotiations between Congress and Muslim League for power sharing failed and gave way to the independence and bloody [[partition of India]] in 1947.\n\nNehru was elected by the Congress to assume office as independent India's first Prime Minister, although the question of leadership had been settled as far back as 1941, when Gandhi acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor. As Prime Minister, he set out to realise his vision of India. The [[Constitution of India]] was enacted in 1950, after which he embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social and political reforms. Chiefly, he oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, [[multi-party system]]. In foreign policy, he took a leading role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia.\n\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a [[catch-all party]], dominating national and state-level politics and winning consecutive elections in [[Indian general election, 1951\u201352|1951]], [[1957 Indian general election|1957]], and [[1962 Indian general election|1962]]. He remained popular with the people of India in spite of political troubles in his final years and failure of leadership during the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]. In India, his birthday is celebrated as ''[[Bal Diwas]]'' (''Children's Day)''.\n\n==Early life and career (1889\u20131912)==\n===Birth and family background===\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in [[Allahabad]] in [[British Raj|British India]]. His father, [[Motilal Nehru]] (1861\u20131931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community,{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=4}} served twice as [[President of the Indian National Congress]], in 1919 and 1928. His mother, [[Swaruprani Thussu]] (1868\u20131938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in [[Lahore]],<ref>Zakaria, Rafiq ''A Study of Nehru'', Times of India Press, 1960, p. 22</ref> was Motilal's second wife, the first having died in child birth. Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children, two of whom were girls.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|}} The elder sister, [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit|Vijaya Lakshmi]], later became the first female president of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>Bonnie G.

He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege at wealthy homes including a palatial estate called the [[Anand Bhavan]]. His father had him educated at home by private governesses and tutors.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=22}} Under the influence of a tutor, Ferdinand T. Brooks, he became interested in science and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]].<ref name=\"OPM\">Om Prakash Misra; Economic Thought of Gandhi and Nehru: A Comparative Analysis. M.D. Publications. 1995. {{ISBN|978-8185880716}}. pp. 49\u201365.</ref> He was subsequently initiated into the [[Theosophical Society]] at age thirteen by family friend [[Annie Besant]]. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=23}} He wrote: \"for nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways he influenced me greatly\".<ref name=\"OPM\" />\n\nNehru's theosophical interests had induced him to the study of the [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]].<ref name=\"BRN\">Bal Ram Nanda; The Nehrus. Oxford University Press. 1962. {{ISBN|978-0195693430}}. p. 65.</ref> According to [[Bal Ram Nanda]], these scriptures were Nehru's \"first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]....[they] provided Nehru the initial impulse for [his] long intellectual quest which culminated...in ''[[The Discovery of India]]''.\"<ref name=\"BRN\" />\n\n===Youth===\nNehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enmjrZiAe9EC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12 |title=Encyclopaedia of eminent thinkers |last=Bharathi |first=K.

About the latter he wrote, \"[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm&nbsp;... Nationalistic ideas filled my mind&nbsp;... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe.\"<ref name=\"OPM\" /> Later when he had begun his institutional schooling in 1905 at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], a leading school in England, he was greatly influenced by [[G. M. Trevelyan]]'s [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=36}} He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: \"Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind India and Italy got strangely mixed together.\"<ref name=\"OPM\" />\n\n===Graduation===\nNehru went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in [[natural science]] in 1910.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=43}} During this period, he also studied politics, economics, history and literature desultorily. Writings of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[John Maynard Keynes|J.M.

But, unlike his father, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the company of lawyers. He wrote: \"Decidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually stimulating and a sense of the utter insipidity of life grew upon me.\"<ref name=\"OPM\" /> His involvement in nationalist politics would gradually replace his legal practice in the coming years.<ref name=\"OPM\" />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nJawaharlal Nehru as a young child with his parents.png|The Nehru family c. 1890s\nNehru at Harrow.png|Nehru dressed in cadet uniform at Harrow School in England\nJawaharlal Nehru Khaki Shorts.jpg|Nehru in [[khaki]] uniform as a member of [[Seva Dal]]\nNehru barrister.png|Nehru at the Allahabad High Court\n</gallery>\n\n==Struggle for Indian independence (1912\u20131947)==\n\n===In Britain===\nNehru had developed an interest in Indian politics during his time in Britain as a student and a barrister.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=37}}\n\n===Early contribution on return to India===\nWithin months of his return to India in 1912, Nehru attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in [[Patna]].{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Congress in 1912 was the party of moderates and elites,{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} and he was disconcerted by what he saw as \"very much an English-knowing upper-class affair\".{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=49}} Nehru harboured doubts regarding the effectiveness of Congress but agreed to work for the party in support of the [[Satyagraha|Indian civil rights movement]] led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in South Africa,{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=50}} collecting funds for the movement in 1913.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Later, he campaigned against indentured labour and other such discrimination faced by Indians in the British colonies.<ref name=\"auto\">In Jawaharlal Nehru's autobiography, ''An Autobiography'' (1936) p. 33.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, sympathy in India was divided. Although educated Indians \"by and large took a vicarious pleasure\" in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the [[Triple Entente|Allies]]. Nehru confessed that he viewed the war with mixed feelings. [[Frank Moraes]] wrote: \"If [Nehru's] sympathy was with any country it was with France, whose culture he greatly admired.\"{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=52}} During the war, Nehru volunteered for the [[St John Ambulance]] and worked as one of the provincial secretaries of the organisation in Allahabad.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} He also spoke out against the censorship acts passed by the British government in India.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=53}}\n\n[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru and his family in 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Nehru in 1919 with wife [[Kamala Nehru|Kamala]] and daughter [[Indira Gandhi|Indira]]]]\n\nNehru emerged from the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. Although the political discourse had been dominated at this time by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]],{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=50}} a moderate who said that it was \"madness to think of independence\",{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru had spoken \"openly of the politics of non-cooperation, of the need of resigning from honorary positions under the government and of not continuing the futile politics of representation\".{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=26}} He ridiculed the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] for its support of British policies. He noted that someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, \"with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in this country, as neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service\".<ref name=\"ics\">Nehru, Jawaharlal ''Glimpses of world history: being further letters to his daughter'' (Lindsay Drummond Ltd., 1949), p. 94</ref> Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader, acknowledged the limits of constitutional agitation, but counselled his son that there was no other \"practical alternative\" to it. Nehru, however, was not satisfied with the pace of the national movement. He became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders who were demanding [[Indian Home Rule movement|Home Rule]] for Indians.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=56}}\n\nThe influence of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Besant and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] took the opportunity to call for a [[Indian Home Rule movement|national movement for Home Rule]]. But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=55}} He remarked later: \"[Besant] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood... even later when I entered political life her influence continued.\"{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=55}} Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] with the [[Lucknow Pact]] at the annual meeting of the Congress in December 1916.

In 1927, his efforts paid off and the Congress was invited to attend the congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels in Belgium.

In the face of these allegations, Nehru responded, \"We have sympathy for the national movement of Arabs in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] because it is directed against British Imperialism.

He developed into a king and the king got the strange notion that everything in the country belonged to him. He thought he was the country. ... Kings forgot that they were really chosen by the people in order to organize and distribute the food and other things of the country among the people. They forgot that they were chosen because they were supposed to be the cleverest and the most experienced persons in the tribe or country. They imagined that they were masters and all the other people in the country were their servants. As a matter of fact, they were servants of the country.\n\nLater on ... kings became so conceited that they thought that people had nothing to do with choosing them. It was God himself, they said, that had made them kings. They called this the \u201cdivine right of kings.\u201d For long years, they misbehaved like this and lived in great pomp and luxury while their people starved.\n\nIn India, we have still many rajas and maharajas and nawabs. You see them going about with fine clothes, in expensive motor cars and spending a lot of money on themselves. Where do they get all this money from? They get it in taxes from the people. The taxes are given so that the money may be used to help all the people in the country \u2014 by making schools and hospitals and libraries and museums and good roads and many other things for the good of the people. But our rajas and maharajas still think as the French king did of old L\u2019etat c\u2019est moi \u2014 \u201cthe state, it is I.\u201d And they spend the money of the people on their own pleasures.

But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.&nbsp;... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.&nbsp;...

However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane. A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine of 1943\u201344]] during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir.

The article has formed the basis of secularism in India.<ref>Erckel, Sebastian (2011). ''India and the European Union \u2013 Two Models of Integration'', GRIN Verlag, {{ISBN|365601048X}}, p. 128</ref> However, Nehru has been criticized for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, Nehru allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. Also in the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Muslim Personal law was prohibited by Nehru. This was the result of the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.\n\nWhile Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954|Special Marriage Act]] in 1954.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-code-nehru-okayed-principle-but-didnt-make-it-a-directive/articleshow/60183225.cms |title=Uniform code: Nehru okayed principle, but didn't make it a directive \u2013 Times of India}}</ref> The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thewire.in/religion/why-triple-talaq-needs-to-be-abolished |title=Why Triple Talaq Needs to be Abolished}}</ref>\n\n====Reservations for socially oppressed communities====\nA system of reservations in government services and educational institutions was created to eradicate the social inequalities and disadvantages faced by peoples of the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]].

Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/Language-issue-again-the-need-for-a-clear-headed-policy/article16854068.ece |title=Language issue again: The need for a clear-headed policy |last=Viswanathan |first=S. |date=6 December 2009 |work=The Hindu}}</ref> To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations.The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by [[Indira Gandhi]] to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages.

He was a strong supporter of the United Nations, except when it tried to resolve the Kashmir question. He pioneered the policy of non-alignment and co-founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. Recognising the People's Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with [[Taiwan]]), Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in their conflict with Korea.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Robert Sherrod |date=19 January 1963 |title=Nehru:The Great Awakening |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=60\u201367}}</ref> He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950, and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.\n\nNehru was a key organizer of the [[Bandung Conference]] of April 1955, which brought 29 newly independent nations together from Asia and Africa, and was designed to galvanize the nonalignment movement under Nehru's leadership. He envisioned it as his key leadership opportunity on the world stage, where he would bring together the emerging nations.<ref>Gopal, 2:232-35.</ref> Instead, he was upstaged by the Chinese representative, [[Zhou Enlai]], who downplayed revolutionary communism and acknowledged the right of all nations to choose their own economic and political systems, including even capitalism. Nehru and his top foreign-policy aide [[V.K. Krishna Menon]] by contrast gained an international reputation as rude and undiplomatic. Zhou said, \"I've never met a more arrogant man than Mr. Nehru.\" A senior Indian foreign office official characterize Menon as \"an outstanding world statesman but the world's worst diplomat,\" adding that he was often \"overbearing, churlish and vindictive\" <ref>H.

He used overwhelming military force to seize [[Indian annexation of Hyderabad|Hyderabad In 1948]] and [[Annexation of Goa|Goa In 1961]].  He was keenly sensitive regarding the geostrategic and military strengths and weaknesses of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] in 1949, he stated: \"We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi...but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom.

The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and a leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the [[International Monetary Fund]] to make Britain and France back down.During the [[Suez crisis]], Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Nasser]] to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/indias-moment-in-the-suez-canal-crisis/article9320638.ece |title=India's moment in the Suez Canal crisis}}</ref>\n\nThe US had hoped to court Nehru after its intervention in favour of Nasser during the Suez crisis. However, [[Cold War]] suspicions and the American distrust of Nehruvian socialism cooled relations between India and the US, which suspected Nehru of tacitly supporting the Soviet Union. Nehru maintained good relations with Britain even after the Suez Crisis. Nehru accepted the arbitration of the UK and World Bank, signing the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] in 1960 with Pakistani ruler [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] to resolve long-standing disputes about sharing the resources of the major rivers of the Punjab region.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eeRFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74 |title=The Ideas of Modern Indian Political Thinkers on Women |last=Meena Gaikwad |first=Dr |isbn=9781387477685}}</ref>\n\n====Goa====\nAfter years of failed negotiations, Nehru authorised the [[Indian Army]] to [[Annexation of Goa|invade]] Portuguese-controlled [[Portuguese India|Goa]] in 1961, and then he formally annexed it to India.

Later, Pakistan handed over some portion of Kashmir near Siachen controlled by Pakistan since 1948 to China. The war exposed the unpreparedness of India's military which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the many times larger Chinese army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government's insufficient attention to defence. In response, Nehru sacked the defence minister [[V. K. Krishna Menon]] and sought US military aid. Nehru's improved relations with the US under [[John F. Kennedy]] proved useful during the war, as in 1962, President of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] was made to guarantee his neutrality in regards to India, who was threatened by \"communist aggression from Red China\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842104-10,00.html |title=Asia: Ending the Suspense |date=17 September 1965 |work=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521075607/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C842104-10%2C00.html |archive-date=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Indian relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies was also seemingly validated. Nehru would continue to maintain his commitment to the non-aligned movement despite calls from some to settle down on one permanent ally.\n\nThe aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Nehru, who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India. Under American advice (by American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis) Nehru refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the Indian air force to beat back the Chinese advances. The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet. Indians, in general, became highly sceptical of China and its military. Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question Nehru's usage of the term \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\"). The war also put an end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers.<ref name=\"Garver\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/garver.pdf |title=China's Decision for War with India in 1962 by John W.

India's policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under Nehru, completed by his daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over rival Pakistan in 1971. Toward the end of the war India had increased her support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. Nehru ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained \"Tibetan Armed Force\" composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/tibetans-in-exile-india-elections-right-to-vote |title=Tibetans-in-exile divided over right to vote in Indian elections |last=Sehgal |first=Saransh |date=7 May 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kFGhwZxeG5kC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195 |title=Indo-Tibet-China Conflict |last=Lal |first=Dinesh |year=2008 |isbn=9788178357140}}</ref>\n\nDuring the conflict, Nehru wrote two desperate letters to US President John F. Kennedy, requesting 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system. These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino-Indian War), leading to a cool down in Indo-US relations. According to former Indian diplomat G Parthasarathy, \"only after we got nothing from the US did arms supplies from the Soviet Union to India commence\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jawaharlal-Nehru-pleaded-for-US-help-against-China-in-1962/articleshow/6931810.cms |title=Jawaharlal Nehru pleaded for US help against China in 1962 |date=16 November 2010 |work=The Times of India |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102020532/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jawaharlal-Nehru-pleaded-for-US-help-against-China-in-1962/articleshow/6931810.cms |archive-date=2 January 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Per ''Time'' Magazine's 1962 editorial on the war, however, this may not have been the case.

Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the [[Allahabad High Court]] and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. A committed nationalist since his teenage years, he became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s. He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the [[Indian National Congress]] during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Gandhi. As [[Congress President]] in 1929, Nehru called for [[Purna Swaraj|complete independence]] from the [[British Raj]] and instigated the Congress's decisive shift towards the left.\n\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s as the country moved towards independence. His idea of a [[Secular state|secular nation-state]] was seemingly validated when the Congress swept the [[1937 Indian provincial elections|1937 provincial elections]] and formed the government in several provinces; on the other hand, the separatist [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] fared much poorer. But these achievements were severely compromised in the aftermath of the [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942, which saw the British effectively crush the Congress as a political organisation. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, for he had desired to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort during [[World War II]], came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League under his old Congress colleague and now opponent, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], had come to dominate Muslim politics in India. Negotiations between Congress and Muslim League for power sharing failed and gave way to the independence and bloody [[partition of India]] in 1947.\n\nNehru was elected by the Congress to assume office as independent India's first Prime Minister, although the question of leadership had been settled as far back as 1941, when Gandhi acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor. As Prime Minister, he set out to realise his vision of India. The [[Constitution of India]] was enacted in 1950, after which he embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social and political reforms. Chiefly, he oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, [[multi-party system]]. In foreign policy, he took a leading role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia.\n\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a [[catch-all party]], dominating national and state-level politics and winning consecutive elections in [[Indian general election, 1951\u201352|1951]], [[1957 Indian general election|1957]], and [[1962 Indian general election|1962]]. He remained popular with the people of India in spite of political troubles in his final years and failure of leadership during the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]. In India, his birthday is celebrated as ''[[Bal Diwas]]'' (''Children's Day)''.\n\n==Early life and career (1889\u20131912)==\n===Birth and family background===\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in [[Allahabad]] in [[British Raj|British India]]. His father, [[Motilal Nehru]] (1861\u20131931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community,{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=4}} served twice as [[President of the Indian National Congress]], in 1919 and 1928. His mother, [[Swaruprani Thussu]] (1868\u20131938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in [[Lahore]],<ref>Zakaria, Rafiq ''A Study of Nehru'', Times of India Press, 1960, p. 22</ref> was Motilal's second wife, the first having died in child birth.

Although educated Indians \"by and large took a vicarious pleasure\" in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the [[Triple Entente|Allies]].

But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=55}} He remarked later: \"[Besant] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood... even later when I entered political life her influence continued.\"{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=55}} Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] with the [[Lucknow Pact]] at the annual meeting of the Congress in December 1916. The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the [[All India Congress Committee]] which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan. Nehru welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=55}}\n\n===Home rule movement===\nSeveral nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant to voice a demand for [[self-governance]], and to obtain the status of a [[Dominion]] within the [[British Empire]] as enjoyed by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland at the time.

He sought foreign allies for India and forged links with movements for independence and democracy all over the world. In 1927, his efforts paid off and the Congress was invited to attend the congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels in Belgium. The meeting was called to co-ordinate and plan a common struggle against imperialism. Nehru represented India and was elected to the Executive Council of the League against Imperialism that was born at this meeting.{{sfn|Moraes|2007|p=115}}\n\nIncreasingly, Nehru saw the struggle for independence from [[British imperialism]] as a multi-national effort by the various colonies and dominions of the Empire; some of his statements on this matter, however, were interpreted as complicity with the rise of [[Hitler]] and his [[The Final Solution|espoused intentions]]. In the face of these allegations, Nehru responded, \"We have sympathy for the national movement of Arabs in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] because it is directed against British Imperialism.

He developed into a king and the king got the strange notion that everything in the country belonged to him. He thought he was the country. ... Kings forgot that they were really chosen by the people in order to organize and distribute the food and other things of the country among the people. They forgot that they were chosen because they were supposed to be the cleverest and the most experienced persons in the tribe or country. They imagined that they were masters and all the other people in the country were their servants. As a matter of fact, they were servants of the country.\n\nLater on ... kings became so conceited that they thought that people had nothing to do with choosing them. It was God himself, they said, that had made them kings. They called this the \u201cdivine right of kings.\u201d For long years, they misbehaved like this and lived in great pomp and luxury while their people starved.\n\nIn India, we have still many rajas and maharajas and nawabs. You see them going about with fine clothes, in expensive motor cars and spending a lot of money on themselves. Where do they get all this money from? They get it in taxes from the people. The taxes are given so that the money may be used to help all the people in the country \u2014 by making schools and hospitals and libraries and museums and good roads and many other things for the good of the people. But our rajas and maharajas still think as the French king did of old L\u2019etat c\u2019est moi \u2014 \u201cthe state, it is I.\u201d And they spend the money of the people on their own pleasures.

The article has formed the basis of secularism in India.<ref>Erckel, Sebastian (2011). ''India and the European Union \u2013 Two Models of Integration'', GRIN Verlag, {{ISBN|365601048X}}, p. 128</ref> However, Nehru has been criticized for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, Nehru allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. Also in the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Muslim Personal law was prohibited by Nehru. This was the result of the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.\n\nWhile Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954|Special Marriage Act]] in 1954.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-code-nehru-okayed-principle-but-didnt-make-it-a-directive/articleshow/60183225.cms |title=Uniform code: Nehru okayed principle, but didn't make it a directive \u2013 Times of India}}</ref> The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thewire.in/religion/why-triple-talaq-needs-to-be-abolished |title=Why Triple Talaq Needs to be Abolished}}</ref>\n\n====Reservations for socially oppressed communities====\nA system of reservations in government services and educational institutions was created to eradicate the social inequalities and disadvantages faced by peoples of the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]].

Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/Language-issue-again-the-need-for-a-clear-headed-policy/article16854068.ece |title=Language issue again: The need for a clear-headed policy |last=Viswanathan |first=S. |date=6 December 2009 |work=The Hindu}}</ref> To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965.

He was a strong supporter of the United Nations, except when it tried to resolve the Kashmir question. He pioneered the policy of non-alignment and co-founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. Recognising the People's Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with [[Taiwan]]), Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in their conflict with Korea.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Robert Sherrod |date=19 January 1963 |title=Nehru:The Great Awakening |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=60\u201367}}</ref> He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950, and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.\n\nNehru was a key organizer of the [[Bandung Conference]] of April 1955, which brought 29 newly independent nations together from Asia and Africa, and was designed to galvanize the nonalignment movement under Nehru's leadership.

He was keenly sensitive regarding the geostrategic and military strengths and weaknesses of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] in 1949, he stated: \"We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi...but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom.

The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and a leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the [[International Monetary Fund]] to make Britain and France back down.During the [[Suez crisis]], Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Nasser]] to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/indias-moment-in-the-suez-canal-crisis/article9320638.ece |title=India's moment in the Suez Canal crisis}}</ref>\n\nThe US had hoped to court Nehru after its intervention in favour of Nasser during the Suez crisis. However, [[Cold War]] suspicions and the American distrust of Nehruvian socialism cooled relations between India and the US, which suspected Nehru of tacitly supporting the Soviet Union. Nehru maintained good relations with Britain even after the Suez Crisis.

Later, Pakistan handed over some portion of Kashmir near Siachen controlled by Pakistan since 1948 to China. The war exposed the unpreparedness of India's military which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the many times larger Chinese army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government's insufficient attention to defence. In response, Nehru sacked the defence minister [[V. K. Krishna Menon]] and sought US military aid. Nehru's improved relations with the US under [[John F. Kennedy]] proved useful during the war, as in 1962, President of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] was made to guarantee his neutrality in regards to India, who was threatened by \"communist aggression from Red China\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842104-10,00.html |title=Asia: Ending the Suspense |date=17 September 1965 |work=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521075607/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C842104-10%2C00.html |archive-date=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Indian relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies was also seemingly validated. Nehru would continue to maintain his commitment to the non-aligned movement despite calls from some to settle down on one permanent ally.\n\nThe aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Nehru, who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India. Under American advice (by American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis) Nehru refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the Indian air force to beat back the Chinese advances. The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet. Indians, in general, became highly sceptical of China and its military. Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question Nehru's usage of the term \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\"). The war also put an end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers.<ref name=\"Garver\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/garver.pdf |title=China's Decision for War with India in 1962 by John W.

India's policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under Nehru, completed by his daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over rival Pakistan in 1971. Toward the end of the war India had increased her support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. Nehru ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained \"Tibetan Armed Force\" composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/tibetans-in-exile-india-elections-right-to-vote |title=Tibetans-in-exile divided over right to vote in Indian elections |last=Sehgal |first=Saransh |date=7 May 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kFGhwZxeG5kC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195 |title=Indo-Tibet-China Conflict |last=Lal |first=Dinesh |year=2008 |isbn=9788178357140}}</ref>\n\nDuring the conflict, Nehru wrote two desperate letters to US President John F. Kennedy, requesting 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system. These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino-Indian War), leading to a cool down in Indo-US relations.
