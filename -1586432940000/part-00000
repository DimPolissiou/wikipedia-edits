He subsequently achieved nominal autonomy from the central Abbasid government. During his reign (868&ndash;884) and those of his successors, the Tulunid domains were expanded to include [[Jordan Rift Valley]], as well as [[Hejaz]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]]. Ahmad was succeeded by his son Khumarawayh, whose military and diplomatic achievements made him a major player in the Middle Eastern political stage. The Abbasids affirmed their recognition of the Tulunids as legitimate rulers, and the dynasty's status as vassals to the [[caliphate]]. After Khumarawayh's death, his successor [[emir]]s were ineffectual rulers, allowing their [[Turkish people|Turkic]] and black [[Slavery in Islam|slave]]-soldiers to run the affairs of the state. In 905, the Tulunids were unable to resist an invasion by the Abbasid troops, who restored direct caliphal rule in Syria and Egypt.<ref name = Britannica>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073737/Tulunid-Dynasty Tulunid Dynasty].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref><ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe Tulunid period was marked by economic and administrative reforms alongside cultural ones. Ahmad ibn Tulun changed the taxation system and aligned himself with the merchant community. He also established the Tulunid army. The capital was moved from [[Fustat]] to [[al-Qata'i]], where the celebrated [[mosque of Ibn Tulun]] was constructed.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the fragmentation of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 9th and 10th centuries]]\nThe rise and fall of the Tulunids occurred against a backdrop of increasing [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was struggling with [[Anarchy at Samarra|political disturbances]] and losing its aura of universal legitimacy. There had previously been [[Copt]]ic and [[Alid|Shia Alid]]-led movements in Egypt and Baghdad, without more than temporary and local success. There was also a struggle for power between the Turkish military command and the administration of [[Baghdad]]. Furthermore, there was a widening imperial financial crisis. All of these themes would recur during the Tulunid rule.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe internal politics of the Abbasid caliphate itself seem to have been unstable. In 870, [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|Ab\u016b A\u1e25mad (b. al-Mutawakkil) al-Muwaffa\u1e33]] (d. 891) was summoned from exile in [[Mecca]] to re-establish Abbasid authority over southern Iraq. Quickly, however, he became the ''de facto'' ruler of the caliphate. As a result of this uncertainty, Ahmad ibn Tulun could establish and expand his authority. Thus the Tulunids wielded regional power, largely unhindered by imperial will; as such, the Tulunids can be compared with other 9th-century dynasties of the Muslim world, including the [[Aghlabid]]s and the [[Tahirids]].<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\n===Ahmad ibn Tulun===\n{{main|Ahmad ibn Tulun}}\nAhmad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was a member of the mostly Central Asian Turkish guard formed initially in [[Baghdad]], then later settled in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]], upon its establishment as the seat of the caliphate by [[al-Mu'tasim]]. In 254/868,<ref>The first date indicates the year according to the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]], while the second one denotes the corresponding Gregorian year</ref> Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as resident governor by B\u0101yakb\u0101k (d. 256/870), the representative of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu\u02bftazz.<ref name=\"EI1\">\"\u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnids,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Ibn Tulun promptly established a financial and military presence in the province of Egypt by establishing an independent Egyptian army and taking over the management of the Egyptian and Syrian treasuries. In 877, troops of the caliphate were sent against him, due to his insufficient payment of tribute. Ahmad ibn Tulun, however, maintained his power, and took Syria the following year.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nHis reign of more than ten years allowed him to leave behind a well-trained military, a stable economy and an experienced bureaucracy to oversee the state affairs. He appointed his son, \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, as the heir.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nWith full autonomy, once the tax income no longer had to go to the [[Caliph]] in Baghdad, it was possible to develop irrigation works and build a navy, which greatly stimulated the local economy and trade. In 878, the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan valley]] was occupied by the Tulunids, extending in the north to the outposts in the Anti-Lebanon mountains on the Byzantine border, enabling them to defend Egypt against Abbasid attack.<ref>Lev, Yaacov, ''War and society in the eastern Mediterranean, 7th-15th centuries'', BRILL, 1997, pp.129-130</ref>\n\n===Khumarawayh===\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|right|300px|Extent of the Tulunid domains under Khumarawayh, in 893]]\nFollowing his father's death, [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Khumarawayh]] took control as the designated heir. The first challenge he faced was the invasion of Syria by armies sent by al-Muwaffak, the ''de facto'' ruler during the reign of caliph al-Mu'tamid. Khumarawayh also had to deal with the defection of Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti to the invaders' camp, a long-time and key ally of his father's.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe young Tulunid achieved political and military gains, enabling him to extend his authority from Egypt into northern Iraq, and as far north as [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] by 890. Being now a prominent player in the Near Eastern political stage, he negotiated two treaties with the Abbasids. In the first treaty in 886, al-Muwaffak recognized Tulunid authority over Egypt and the regions of Syria for a thirty-year period. The second treaty, reached with al-Mu\u02bftadid in 892, confirmed the terms of the earlier accord. Both treaties also sought to confirm the status of the Tulunid governor as a vassal of the caliphal family seated in Baghdad.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nDespite his gains, Khumarawayh's reign also set the stage for the demise of the dynasty. Financial exhaustion, political infighting and strides by the Abbasids would all contribute to the ruin of the Tulunids.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> Khumarawayh was also totally reliant on his Turkish and sub-Saharan soldiers. Under the administration of Khumarawayh, the Syro-Egyptian state's finances and military were destabilized.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n===Demise===\nThe later emirs of the dynasty were all ineffectual rulers, relying on their Turkish and black soldiers to run the affairs of the state.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nKhumarawayh's son [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Abu 'l-Asakir]] (also known as Jaysh) was deposed by the Tulunid military command in 896 AD, shortly after coming to power. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh|Harun]]. Though he would rule for eight years, he was unable to revitalize the dynasty, and was assassinated in 904, after the Abbasid army had recovered Syria and was on the verge of invading Egypt itself. Harun's successor, his uncle [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]], was unable to resist an Abbasid invasion under the command of [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], with naval support from [[Thughur|frontier]] forces under [[Damian of Tarsus]]. This brought an end to his reign and that of the Tulunids.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|al-Qata'i|Mosque of Ibn Tulun}}\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Minaret of [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun|Ibn-Tulun Mosque]], the largest remaining building from the Tulunid period today.]]\nAhmad ibn Tulun founded his own capital, [[al-Qata'i]], north of the previous capital [[Fustat]], where he seated his government. One of the dominant features of this city, and indeed the feature that survives today, was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]. The mosque is built in a [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]n style that was common in the period during which the caliphate had shifted capitals from [[Baghdad]] to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This style of architecture was not just confined to religious buildings, but secular ones also. Surviving houses of the Tulunid period have Samarran-style stucco panels.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif (1989)</ref>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh's reign exceeded his father's in spending. He built luxuriant palaces and gardens for himself and those he favored. To the Tulunid Egyptians, his \"marvelous\" blue-eyed palace lion exemplified his prodigality. His stables were so extensive that, according to popular lore, Khumarawaih never rode a horse more than once. Though he squandered the dynastic wealth, he also encouraged a rich cultural life with patronage of scholarship and poetry. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the teacher of his sons was the famed grammarian Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Muslim (d. 944).  An encomium was written by \u1e32\u0101sim b . Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Maryam\u012b (d. 929) to celebrate Khumarawaih's triumphs on the battlefield.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nThrough the mediation of his closest adviser, al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u1e0ej\u0332a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, Khumarawaih arranged for one of the great political marriages of medieval [[Islamic history]]. He proposed his daughter's marriage to a member of the caliphal family in Baghdad. The marriage between the Tulunid princess \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 with the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Mu'tadid]] took place in 892. The exorbitant marriage included an awesome dowry estimated at between 400,000 and one million [[dinar]]s. Some speculate that the splendours of the wedding were a calculated attempt by the Abbasids to ruin the Tulunids. The tale of the splendid nuptials of \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 lived on in the memory of the [[Egyptian people]] well into the [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman period]], and were recorded in the chronicles and the folk-literature.<ref name = Khumarawayh/> The marriage's importance arises from its exceptional nature: the phenomenon of marriage between royal families is rare in Islamic history.<ref>Rizk, Yunan Labib.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm Royal mix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625135135/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm |date=25 June 2013 }}.

The need for the establishment of an autonomous armed force became apparent after the revolt of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ibn al-S\u0332h\u0332ayk\u0332h, governor of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in 870. In response, Ibn Tulun organized an army composed of [[Sudan]]ese and [[Greeks|Greek]] slave-soldiers. Other reports indicate the soldiers may have been [[Persian people|Persians]] and Sudanese.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh continued his father's policy of having a multi-ethnic army. His military prowess, in fact, was strengthened by his multi-ethnic regiments of black Sudanese soldiers, Greek mercenaries and fresh [[Turkic people|Turkic]] troops from [[Turkestan]].<ref name = Khumarawayh>\"\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh  b. A\u1e25mad b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn ,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nIbn Tulun founded an \u00e9lite guard to surround the Tulunid family. These formed the core of the Tulunid army, around which other larger regiments were built. These troops are said to have been from the region of G\u0332h\u0332\u016br in [[Afghanistan]], during Ibn Tulun's reign, and from local Arabs during the reign of \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh. In a ceremony held in 871, Ibn Tulun had his forces swear personal allegiance to him. Nevertheless, there were defections from the Tulunid army, most notably of the high-ranking commander Lu\u02belu\u02be in 883 to the Abbasids. Throughout its life the army faced such persistent problems of securing allegiance.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh also established an elite corps called ''al-muk\u0332h\u0332t\u0101ra''. The corps was composed of unruly [[bedouin]]s of the eastern [[Nile delta]]. By bestowing privileges upon the tribesmen, and converting them into an efficient and loyal bodyguard, he brought peace to the region between Egypt and Syria. He also re-asserted his control over this strategic region. The regiment also included one thousand Sudanese natives.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nA list of military engagements in which the Tulunid army constituted a significant party is as follows:\n*In 877, the Tulunid troops, after displaying their strength, forced the Abbasid army under [[Musa ibn Bugha|M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Bug\u0332h\u0332\u0101]] to abandon his plan to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad>\"A\u1e25mad  b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n*In 878, the Tulunids, under the pretext of a ''[[jihad]]'' to defend the frontier districts ([[Thughur]]) against the Byzantines, occupied Syria. This campaign was ended prematurely, as Ibn Tulun had to return to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*In 885, the Tulunid army led by Khumarawayh met the invading Abbasids at the [[Battle of the Mills]] (al-\u1e6caw\u0101\u1e25\u012bn) in southern Palestine. The Abbasids, led by A\u1e25mad ibn al-Muwaffa\u1e33 (the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid), had invaded Syria, and the governor of Damascus had defected to the enemy. After both Ahmad and Khumarawayh fled the battlefield, the \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnid general Sa\u02bfd al-Aysar secured victory.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 885\u2013886, the Tulunid forces, led by Khumarawayh, defeated [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj|Ibn Kund\u0101d\u0332j]], though the latter had superior numbers. A [[domino effect]] followed, as the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], [[Cilicia]] and regions as far east as [[Harran]] submitted to the Tulunid army. Peace treaties with the Tulunids put an end to the military campaigns.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 896 to 905, after the emirate's demise  the Tulunids were unable to stop the Abbasids from taking their capital [[al-Qata'i]].<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the reign of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Egyptian economy remained prosperous. There were propitious levels of agricultural production, stimulated by consistent high flooding of the Nile. Other industries, particularly [[textile]]s, also thrived. In his administration, ibn Tulun asserted his autonomy, refusing to pay taxes to the central Abbasid government in Baghdad. He also reformed the administration, aligning himself with the merchant community, and changing the taxation system. Under the Tulunids, there were also repairs in the agricultural infrastructure. The key sector of production, investment, and participation in their Mediterranean-wide commerce, was textiles, [[linen]] in particular (Frantz, 281-5).<ref name = EI1/> The financial bureaucracy throughout the Tulunid period was headed by members of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family.\n\n===Financial autonomy===\nDuring the period of 870\u2013872, Ibn Tulun asserted more control over Egypt's financial administration. In 871, he took control of the ''[[kharaj]]'' taxes as well as the ''[[thughur|thugh\u016br]]'' from Syria. He also achieved victory over Ibn al-Mudabbir, the head of the finance office and member of the Abbasid bureaucratic \u00e9lite.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe ''de facto'' ruler of the Abbasid caliphate, al-Muwaffak, took issue with Ibn Tulun's financial activities. He wanted to secure Egyptian revenue for his campaign against the [[Zanj]] rebellion (and perhaps limit the autonomy of the Tulunids). This pressing need for funds drew the attention of Baghdad to the considerably more wealthy Egypt.<ref name = EI1/> The situation came to a head in 877, when al-Muwaffak, upon not receiving the demanded funds, sent an army to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad/> Nevertheless, on at least two occasions, Ibn Tulun remitted considerable sums of revenue, along with gifts, to the central Abbasid administration.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nUnder Ahmad's son, Khumarawayh, the Abbasids formally entered into a treaty with the Tulunids, thereby ending hostilities and resuming the payment of tribute. Financial provisions were made in the first treaty in 886 with al-Muwaffak. A second treaty with al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did, the son of al-Muwaffak, in 892, re-affirmed the political terms of the first. Financially, the Tulunids were to pay 300,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs (though this figure may be inaccurate) annually.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n===Tulunid administration===\nThe T\u016bl\u016bnid administration over Egypt bore several notable features. The style of rule was highly centralized and \"pitiless\" in its execution. The administration was also backed by Egypt's commercial, religious and social \u00e9lite. Ahmad ibn Tulun replaced Iraqi officials with an Egyptian bureaucracy. Overall, the administration relied on the powerful merchant community for both financial and diplomatic support. For example, Ma\u02bfmar al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, a leading member of the merchant community in Egypt, served as Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn's financier.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe Tulunid administration also helped the economy prosper, by maintaining political stability, which in Egypt is a ''[[sine qua non]]''. Isolated revolts among the Copts and some Arab nomads in upper Egypt, which never threatened the dynasty's power, were actually a response to the more efficient Tulunid fiscal practices. The economy was strengthened by reforms introduced both immediately before the Tulunids and during their reign. There were changes in the taxes assessment and collection system. There was also an expansion in the use of [[Tax farm|tax-contracts]], which were the source of an emergent land-holding \u00e9lite in this period.<ref name = EI1/> Ahmad ibn Tulun's agrarian and administrative reforms resulted in encouraging peasants to work their lands with zeal, despite the heavy taxes. He also terminated the exactions of the administration officers for their personal profit.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\nOne final feature of the administration under Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was the discontinued practice of draining off the majority of his revenue to the metropolis. Instead, he initiated building programs to benefit other parts of Egypt. He also used those funds to stimulate commerce and industry.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\n===Large expenditures===\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh inherited a stable economy and a wealthy [[polity]] from his father. The treasury was worth ten million d\u012bn\u0101rs at the young Tulunid's succession. When \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh was killed in 896, the treasury was empty, and the dinar had sunk to one-third its value. Part of this financial disaster is attributed to his addiction to luxury, while squandering wealth to win loyalty was also another cause.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, unlike his father, spent lavishly. For example, he gave his daughter, \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101, an extraordinary dowry of 400,000 - 1,000,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, for her wedding in 892 to the Abbasid al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did. This move is speculated by some scholars to have been an attempt by the Abbasid to drain the Tulunid treasury.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n\n===Neighboring states===\n*[[Abbasid]]s\n*[[Byzantine empire]]\n*[[Makuria]]\n*[[Rustamids]]\n\n===Tulunid Amirs===\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Reign \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | ''De facto'' autonomy from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of ''Caliph'' [[al-Mu'tamid]].\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| '''[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]'''<br> <small>{{Nastaliq| \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small> \n|align=\"center\"|868 - 884 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Jaysh''<br><small>{{Nastaliq| \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u06cc\u0634}}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]] <br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }} </small>\n|align=\"center\"|884 - 896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Ashir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u06cc\u0631 }}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Asakir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0627\u0643\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]]<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"|896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu Musa''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|896 - 904 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Manaqib''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0628}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|904 - 905 CE\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#F5DEB3\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |  Re-conquered by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of Caliph [[al-Muktafi]] by general Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |title=The Emergence of Muslim Rule in India: Some Historical Disconnects and Missing Links |first=Tanvir |last=Anjum |journal=Islamic Studies |publisher=Islamic Research Institute |volume=46 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=217\u2013240 [p. 233] |jstor=20839068 |ref=harv }}\n*Behrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305144249/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/6405/doc/DPC0530.pdf Early Islamic Architecture in Cairo]\".

He subsequently achieved nominal autonomy from the central Abbasid government. During his reign (868&ndash;884) and those of his successors, the Tulunid domains were expanded to include [[Jordan Rift Valley]], as well as [[Hejaz]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]]. Ahmad was succeeded by his son Khumarawayh, whose military and diplomatic achievements made him a major player in the Middle Eastern political stage. The Abbasids affirmed their recognition of the Tulunids as legitimate rulers, and the dynasty's status as vassals to the [[caliphate]]. After Khumarawayh's death, his successor [[emir]]s were ineffectual rulers, allowing their [[Turkish people|Turkic]] and black [[Slavery in Islam|slave]]-soldiers to run the affairs of the state. In 905, the Tulunids were unable to resist an invasion by the Abbasid troops, who restored direct caliphal rule in Syria and Egypt.<ref name = Britannica>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073737/Tulunid-Dynasty Tulunid Dynasty].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref><ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe Tulunid period was marked by economic and administrative reforms alongside cultural ones. Ahmad ibn Tulun changed the taxation system and aligned himself with the merchant community. He also established the Tulunid army. The capital was moved from [[Fustat]] to [[al-Qata'i]], where the celebrated [[mosque of Ibn Tulun]] was constructed.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the fragmentation of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 9th and 10th centuries]]\nThe rise and fall of the Tulunids occurred against a backdrop of increasing [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was struggling with [[Anarchy at Samarra|political disturbances]] and losing its aura of universal legitimacy. There had previously been [[Copt]]ic and [[Alid|Shia Alid]]-led movements in Egypt and Baghdad, without more than temporary and local success. There was also a struggle for power between the Turkish military command and the administration of [[Baghdad]]. Furthermore, there was a widening imperial financial crisis. All of these themes would recur during the Tulunid rule.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe internal politics of the Abbasid caliphate itself seem to have been unstable. In 870, [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|Ab\u016b A\u1e25mad (b. al-Mutawakkil) al-Muwaffa\u1e33]] (d. 891) was summoned from exile in [[Mecca]] to re-establish Abbasid authority over southern Iraq. Quickly, however, he became the ''de facto'' ruler of the caliphate. As a result of this uncertainty, Ahmad ibn Tulun could establish and expand his authority. Thus the Tulunids wielded regional power, largely unhindered by imperial will; as such, the Tulunids can be compared with other 9th-century dynasties of the Muslim world, including the [[Aghlabid]]s and the [[Tahirids]].<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\n===Ahmad ibn Tulun===\n{{main|Ahmad ibn Tulun}}\nAhmad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was a member of the mostly Central Asian Turkish guard formed initially in [[Baghdad]], then later settled in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]], upon its establishment as the seat of the caliphate by [[al-Mu'tasim]]. In 254/868,<ref>The first date indicates the year according to the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]], while the second one denotes the corresponding Gregorian year</ref> Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as resident governor by B\u0101yakb\u0101k (d. 256/870), the representative of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu\u02bftazz.<ref name=\"EI1\">\"\u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnids,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Ibn Tulun promptly established a financial and military presence in the province of Egypt by establishing an independent Egyptian army and taking over the management of the Egyptian and Syrian treasuries. In 877, troops of the caliphate were sent against him, due to his insufficient payment of tribute. Ahmad ibn Tulun, however, maintained his power, and took Syria the following year.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nHis reign of more than ten years allowed him to leave behind a well-trained military, a stable economy and an experienced bureaucracy to oversee the state affairs. He appointed his son, \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, as the heir.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nWith full autonomy, once the tax income no longer had to go to the [[Caliph]] in Baghdad, it was possible to develop irrigation works and build a navy, which greatly stimulated the local economy and trade. In 878, [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan valley]] was occupied by the Tulunids, extending in the north to the outposts in the Anti-Lebanon mountains on the Byzantine border, enabling them to defend Egypt against Abbasid attack.<ref>Lev, Yaacov, ''War and society in the eastern Mediterranean, 7th-15th centuries'', BRILL, 1997, pp.129-130</ref>\n\n===Khumarawayh===\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|right|300px|Extent of the Tulunid domains under Khumarawayh, in 893]]\nFollowing his father's death, [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Khumarawayh]] took control as the designated heir. The first challenge he faced was the invasion of Syria by armies sent by al-Muwaffak, the ''de facto'' ruler during the reign of caliph al-Mu'tamid. Khumarawayh also had to deal with the defection of Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti to the invaders' camp, a long-time and key ally of his father's.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe young Tulunid achieved political and military gains, enabling him to extend his authority from Egypt into northern Iraq, and as far north as [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] by 890. Being now a prominent player in the Near Eastern political stage, he negotiated two treaties with the Abbasids. In the first treaty in 886, al-Muwaffak recognized Tulunid authority over Egypt and the regions of Syria for a thirty-year period. The second treaty, reached with al-Mu\u02bftadid in 892, confirmed the terms of the earlier accord. Both treaties also sought to confirm the status of the Tulunid governor as a vassal of the caliphal family seated in Baghdad.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nDespite his gains, Khumarawayh's reign also set the stage for the demise of the dynasty. Financial exhaustion, political infighting and strides by the Abbasids would all contribute to the ruin of the Tulunids.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> Khumarawayh was also totally reliant on his Turkish and sub-Saharan soldiers. Under the administration of Khumarawayh, the Syro-Egyptian state's finances and military were destabilized.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n===Demise===\nThe later emirs of the dynasty were all ineffectual rulers, relying on their Turkish and black soldiers to run the affairs of the state.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nKhumarawayh's son [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Abu 'l-Asakir]] (also known as Jaysh) was deposed by the Tulunid military command in 896 AD, shortly after coming to power. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh|Harun]]. Though he would rule for eight years, he was unable to revitalize the dynasty, and was assassinated in 904, after the Abbasid army had recovered Syria and was on the verge of invading Egypt itself. Harun's successor, his uncle [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]], was unable to resist an Abbasid invasion under the command of [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], with naval support from [[Thughur|frontier]] forces under [[Damian of Tarsus]]. This brought an end to his reign and that of the Tulunids.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|al-Qata'i|Mosque of Ibn Tulun}}\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Minaret of [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun|Ibn-Tulun Mosque]], the largest remaining building from the Tulunid period today.]]\nAhmad ibn Tulun founded his own capital, [[al-Qata'i]], north of the previous capital [[Fustat]], where he seated his government. One of the dominant features of this city, and indeed the feature that survives today, was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]. The mosque is built in a [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]n style that was common in the period during which the caliphate had shifted capitals from [[Baghdad]] to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This style of architecture was not just confined to religious buildings, but secular ones also. Surviving houses of the Tulunid period have Samarran-style stucco panels.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif (1989)</ref>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh's reign exceeded his father's in spending. He built luxuriant palaces and gardens for himself and those he favored. To the Tulunid Egyptians, his \"marvelous\" blue-eyed palace lion exemplified his prodigality. His stables were so extensive that, according to popular lore, Khumarawaih never rode a horse more than once. Though he squandered the dynastic wealth, he also encouraged a rich cultural life with patronage of scholarship and poetry. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the teacher of his sons was the famed grammarian Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Muslim (d. 944).  An encomium was written by \u1e32\u0101sim b . Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Maryam\u012b (d. 929) to celebrate Khumarawaih's triumphs on the battlefield.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nThrough the mediation of his closest adviser, al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u1e0ej\u0332a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, Khumarawaih arranged for one of the great political marriages of medieval [[Islamic history]]. He proposed his daughter's marriage to a member of the caliphal family in Baghdad. The marriage between the Tulunid princess \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 with the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Mu'tadid]] took place in 892. The exorbitant marriage included an awesome dowry estimated at between 400,000 and one million [[dinar]]s. Some speculate that the splendours of the wedding were a calculated attempt by the Abbasids to ruin the Tulunids. The tale of the splendid nuptials of \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 lived on in the memory of the [[Egyptian people]] well into the [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman period]], and were recorded in the chronicles and the folk-literature.<ref name = Khumarawayh/> The marriage's importance arises from its exceptional nature: the phenomenon of marriage between royal families is rare in Islamic history.<ref>Rizk, Yunan Labib.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm Royal mix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625135135/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm |date=25 June 2013 }}.

The need for the establishment of an autonomous armed force became apparent after the revolt of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ibn al-S\u0332h\u0332ayk\u0332h, governor of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in 870. In response, Ibn Tulun organized an army composed of [[Sudan]]ese and [[Greeks|Greek]] slave-soldiers. Other reports indicate the soldiers may have been [[Persian people|Persians]] and Sudanese.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh continued his father's policy of having a multi-ethnic army. His military prowess, in fact, was strengthened by his multi-ethnic regiments of black Sudanese soldiers, Greek mercenaries and fresh [[Turkic people|Turkic]] troops from [[Turkestan]].<ref name = Khumarawayh>\"\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh  b. A\u1e25mad b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn ,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nIbn Tulun founded an \u00e9lite guard to surround the Tulunid family. These formed the core of the Tulunid army, around which other larger regiments were built. These troops are said to have been from the region of G\u0332h\u0332\u016br in [[Afghanistan]], during Ibn Tulun's reign, and from local Arabs during the reign of \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh. In a ceremony held in 871, Ibn Tulun had his forces swear personal allegiance to him. Nevertheless, there were defections from the Tulunid army, most notably of the high-ranking commander Lu\u02belu\u02be in 883 to the Abbasids. Throughout its life the army faced such persistent problems of securing allegiance.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh also established an elite corps called ''al-muk\u0332h\u0332t\u0101ra''. The corps was composed of unruly [[bedouin]]s of the eastern [[Nile delta]]. By bestowing privileges upon the tribesmen, and converting them into an efficient and loyal bodyguard, he brought peace to the region between Egypt and Syria. He also re-asserted his control over this strategic region. The regiment also included one thousand Sudanese natives.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nA list of military engagements in which the Tulunid army constituted a significant party is as follows:\n*In 877, the Tulunid troops, after displaying their strength, forced the Abbasid army under [[Musa ibn Bugha|M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Bug\u0332h\u0332\u0101]] to abandon his plan to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad>\"A\u1e25mad  b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n*In 878, the Tulunids, under the pretext of a ''[[jihad]]'' to defend the frontier districts ([[Thughur]]) against the Byzantines, occupied Syria. This campaign was ended prematurely, as Ibn Tulun had to return to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*In 885, the Tulunid army led by Khumarawayh met the invading Abbasids at the [[Battle of the Mills]] (al-\u1e6caw\u0101\u1e25\u012bn) in southern Palestine. The Abbasids, led by A\u1e25mad ibn al-Muwaffa\u1e33 (the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid), had invaded Syria, and the governor of Damascus had defected to the enemy. After both Ahmad and Khumarawayh fled the battlefield, the \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnid general Sa\u02bfd al-Aysar secured victory.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 885\u2013886, the Tulunid forces, led by Khumarawayh, defeated [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj|Ibn Kund\u0101d\u0332j]], though the latter had superior numbers. A [[domino effect]] followed, as the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], [[Cilicia]] and regions as far east as [[Harran]] submitted to the Tulunid army. Peace treaties with the Tulunids put an end to the military campaigns.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 896 to 905, after the emirate's demise  the Tulunids were unable to stop the Abbasids from taking their capital [[al-Qata'i]].<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the reign of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Egyptian economy remained prosperous. There were propitious levels of agricultural production, stimulated by consistent high flooding of the Nile. Other industries, particularly [[textile]]s, also thrived. In his administration, ibn Tulun asserted his autonomy, refusing to pay taxes to the central Abbasid government in Baghdad. He also reformed the administration, aligning himself with the merchant community, and changing the taxation system. Under the Tulunids, there were also repairs in the agricultural infrastructure. The key sector of production, investment, and participation in their Mediterranean-wide commerce, was textiles, [[linen]] in particular (Frantz, 281-5).<ref name = EI1/> The financial bureaucracy throughout the Tulunid period was headed by members of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family.\n\n===Financial autonomy===\nDuring the period of 870\u2013872, Ibn Tulun asserted more control over Egypt's financial administration. In 871, he took control of the ''[[kharaj]]'' taxes as well as the ''[[thughur|thugh\u016br]]'' from Syria. He also achieved victory over Ibn al-Mudabbir, the head of the finance office and member of the Abbasid bureaucratic \u00e9lite.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe ''de facto'' ruler of the Abbasid caliphate, al-Muwaffak, took issue with Ibn Tulun's financial activities. He wanted to secure Egyptian revenue for his campaign against the [[Zanj]] rebellion (and perhaps limit the autonomy of the Tulunids). This pressing need for funds drew the attention of Baghdad to the considerably more wealthy Egypt.<ref name = EI1/> The situation came to a head in 877, when al-Muwaffak, upon not receiving the demanded funds, sent an army to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad/> Nevertheless, on at least two occasions, Ibn Tulun remitted considerable sums of revenue, along with gifts, to the central Abbasid administration.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nUnder Ahmad's son, Khumarawayh, the Abbasids formally entered into a treaty with the Tulunids, thereby ending hostilities and resuming the payment of tribute. Financial provisions were made in the first treaty in 886 with al-Muwaffak. A second treaty with al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did, the son of al-Muwaffak, in 892, re-affirmed the political terms of the first. Financially, the Tulunids were to pay 300,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs (though this figure may be inaccurate) annually.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n===Tulunid administration===\nThe T\u016bl\u016bnid administration over Egypt bore several notable features. The style of rule was highly centralized and \"pitiless\" in its execution. The administration was also backed by Egypt's commercial, religious and social \u00e9lite. Ahmad ibn Tulun replaced Iraqi officials with an Egyptian bureaucracy. Overall, the administration relied on the powerful merchant community for both financial and diplomatic support. For example, Ma\u02bfmar al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, a leading member of the merchant community in Egypt, served as Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn's financier.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe Tulunid administration also helped the economy prosper, by maintaining political stability, which in Egypt is a ''[[sine qua non]]''. Isolated revolts among the Copts and some Arab nomads in upper Egypt, which never threatened the dynasty's power, were actually a response to the more efficient Tulunid fiscal practices. The economy was strengthened by reforms introduced both immediately before the Tulunids and during their reign. There were changes in the taxes assessment and collection system. There was also an expansion in the use of [[Tax farm|tax-contracts]], which were the source of an emergent land-holding \u00e9lite in this period.<ref name = EI1/> Ahmad ibn Tulun's agrarian and administrative reforms resulted in encouraging peasants to work their lands with zeal, despite the heavy taxes. He also terminated the exactions of the administration officers for their personal profit.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\nOne final feature of the administration under Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was the discontinued practice of draining off the majority of his revenue to the metropolis. Instead, he initiated building programs to benefit other parts of Egypt. He also used those funds to stimulate commerce and industry.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\n===Large expenditures===\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh inherited a stable economy and a wealthy [[polity]] from his father. The treasury was worth ten million d\u012bn\u0101rs at the young Tulunid's succession. When \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh was killed in 896, the treasury was empty, and the dinar had sunk to one-third its value. Part of this financial disaster is attributed to his addiction to luxury, while squandering wealth to win loyalty was also another cause.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, unlike his father, spent lavishly. For example, he gave his daughter, \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101, an extraordinary dowry of 400,000 - 1,000,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, for her wedding in 892 to the Abbasid al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did. This move is speculated by some scholars to have been an attempt by the Abbasid to drain the Tulunid treasury.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n\n===Neighboring states===\n*[[Abbasid]]s\n*[[Byzantine empire]]\n*[[Makuria]]\n*[[Rustamids]]\n\n===Tulunid Amirs===\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Reign \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | ''De facto'' autonomy from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of ''Caliph'' [[al-Mu'tamid]].\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| '''[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]'''<br> <small>{{Nastaliq| \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small> \n|align=\"center\"|868 - 884 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Jaysh''<br><small>{{Nastaliq| \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u06cc\u0634}}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]] <br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }} </small>\n|align=\"center\"|884 - 896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Ashir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u06cc\u0631 }}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Asakir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0627\u0643\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]]<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"|896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu Musa''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|896 - 904 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Manaqib''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0628}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|904 - 905 CE\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#F5DEB3\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |  Re-conquered by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of Caliph [[al-Muktafi]] by general Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |title=The Emergence of Muslim Rule in India: Some Historical Disconnects and Missing Links |first=Tanvir |last=Anjum |journal=Islamic Studies |publisher=Islamic Research Institute |volume=46 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=217\u2013240 [p. 233] |jstor=20839068 |ref=harv }}\n*Behrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305144249/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/6405/doc/DPC0530.pdf Early Islamic Architecture in Cairo]\".
