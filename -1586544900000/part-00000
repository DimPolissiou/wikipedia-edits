The people moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or gathering as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of cross-tribal mobility, especially in troubled times.\n\nIn warm weather, they constructed portable [[wigwam]]s, a type of hut usually with [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] doors.

The homeland of the Algonquian peoples is not known. At the time of the European arrival, the hegemonic [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, was regularly at war with Algonquian neighbours.\n\n==Tribal identities==\n\n===Canada===\nThe French and later English encountered the [[Maliseet]] of present-day [[Maine]], [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]]; the [[Abenaki]] of Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire; the Mi'kmaw [[band government]]s of the [[Maritimes]] lived primarily on fishing. Further north are the Betsiamite, [[Atikamekw]], [[Anishinaabe]] and [[Innu]]/[[Naskapi]]. The [[Beothuk]] of Newfoundland might have been Algonquians, but as their last known speaker died in the early 19th century, little record of their language or culture remains.\n\n===New England area===\nColonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]], [[Massachusett]], [[Nipmuck]], [[Pennacook]], [[Penobscot]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Quinnipiac]]. The [[Mohegan]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocumtuc]], [[Tunxis]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] were based in southern New England. The [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] were located in northern New England: present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in what became the United States and eastern Quebec in what became Canada. They had established trading relationships with French colonists who settled along the Atlantic coast and what was later called the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Mahican]] was located in western New England many people died in the upper Hudson River Valley (around what was developed by Europeans as Albany, New York). These groups practiced agriculture, hunting and fishing.\n\n===Mid- and south-Atlantic and Long Island===\nThe [[Lenape]], also called ''Delaware'', were ([[Munsee language|Munsee]]) and [[Unami language|Unami]] speakers that were in what is now known as the eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, [[lower Hudson Valley]] and western Long Island areas in New York.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Linton|first=Ralph|last2=Hrdlicka|first2=Ales|date=1916-09|title=Physical anthropology of the Lenape or Delawares, and of the eastern Indians in general|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1886448|journal=The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume=3|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/1886448|issn=0161-391X}}</ref> They encountered the European explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in what is now [[New York Harbor]] in 1524. \n\nThe eastern portion of the Long Island was inhabited by speakers of the [[Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language]] group of Algonquian languages; they were related to the [[Pequot people|Pequot]] and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett peoples]] of southern [[New England]]. The tribes of [[Long Island]] included the [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequas]], the [[Matinecocks]], the [[Nissequogue, New York|Nissequogues]], the [[Setalcott|Setaukets]], the [[Corchaug|Corchaugs]], the [[Secatogue|Secatogues]], the [[Poospatuck Reservation|Unkechaugs]], the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecocks]], the [[Montaukett|Montauketts]], and the [[Shelter Island, New York|Manhasets]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] documented the language of the [[Poospatuck Reservation|Unkechaug]] Tribe in 1790. \n\nFurther south were the traditional homes of the [[Powhatan]], a loose group of bands numbering into the tens of thousands, who were among the first to encounter English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay region. Historic people also included the [[Nanticoke tribe|Nanticoke]], [[Wicocomico]], [[Secotan]], [[Chowanoke]], [[Weapemeoc]], and [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]].\n\nThe southernmost Algonquin peoples were clustered around [[Pamlico Sound]] in what is now North Carolina, including the [[Pamplico]], [[Chowanoke]], and [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]].\n\n===Midwest===\nThe French encountered Algonquian peoples in this area through their trade and limited colonization of New France along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The historic peoples of the Illinois Country were the [[Shawnee]], [[Illiniwek]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Menominee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]]. The latter were also known as the Sac and Fox, and later known as the Meskwaki Indians, who lived throughout the present-day Midwest of the United States.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, many Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River were displaced over great distances through the United States passage and enforcement of [[Indian removal]] legislation; they forced the people west of the [[Mississippi River]] to what they designated as [[Indian Territory]]. After the US extinguished Indian land claims, this area was admitted as the state of [[Oklahoma]] in the early 20th century.\n\n===Upper west===\nOjibwe/Chippewa, [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]], and a variety of [[Cree]] groups lived in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Western Ontario]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and the [[Canadian Prairies]].

By using various kinds of native corn (maize), beans and squash, southern New England natives were able to improve their diet to such a degree that their population increased and they reached a density of 287 people per 100 square miles as opposed to 41 in the north.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cronon |first=William |date=1983 |title=Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHclmuykdBQC&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=%2241%22+%22287%22+#v=onepage&q=%2241%22%20%22287%22&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |page=42 |isbn=978-0-8090-0158-3}}</ref>\n\nEven with mobile crop rotation, southern villages were necessarily less mobile than northern ones. The natives continued their seasonal occupation but tended to move into fixed villages near their lands. They adjusted to the change partially by developing a gender-oriented [[division of labor]]. The women cultivated crops, and the men fished and hunted.\n\nScholars estimate that, by the year 1600, the indigenous population of New England had reached 70,000\u2013100,000.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cronon |first=William |date=1983 |title=Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHclmuykdBQC&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=%2241%22+%22287%22+#v=onepage&q=%2241%22%20%22287%22&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |page=42 |isbn=978-0-8090-0158-3}}</ref>\n\n==Colonial period==\n\nAt the time of the first European settlements in North America, Algonquian peoples occupied what is now [[New Brunswick]], and much of what is now [[Canada]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]; what is now [[New England]], [[New Jersey]], southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Delaware]] and down the Atlantic Coast through the [[Upper South]]; and around the Great Lakes in present-day [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]] and [[Iowa]]. The homeland of the Algonquian peoples is not known. At the time of the European arrival, the hegemonic [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, was regularly at war with Algonquian neighbours.\n\n==Tribal identities==\n\n===Canada===\nThe French and later English encountered the [[Maliseet]] of present-day [[Maine]], [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]]; the [[Abenaki]] of Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire; the Mi'kmaw [[band government]]s of the [[Maritimes]] lived primarily on fishing. Further north are the Betsiamite, [[Atikamekw]], [[Anishinaabe]] and [[Innu]]/[[Naskapi]]. The [[Beothuk]] of Newfoundland might have been Algonquians, but as their last known speaker died in the early 19th century, little record of their language or culture remains.\n\n===New England area===\nColonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]], [[Massachusett]], [[Nipmuck]], [[Pennacook]], [[Penobscot]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Quinnipiac]]. The [[Mohegan]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocumtuc]], [[Tunxis]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] were based in southern New England. The [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] were located in northern New England: present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in what became the United States and eastern Quebec in what became Canada. They had established trading relationships with French colonists who settled along the Atlantic coast and what was later called the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Mahican]] was located in western New England many people died in the upper Hudson River Valley (around what was developed by Europeans as Albany, New York). These groups practiced agriculture, hunting and fishing.\n\n===Mid- and south-Atlantic and Long Island===\nThe [[Lenape]], also called ''Delaware'', were ([[Munsee language|Munsee]]) and [[Unami language|Unami]] speakers that were in what is now known as the eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, [[lower Hudson Valley]] and western Long Island areas in New York. They encountered the European explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in what is now [[New York Harbor]] in 1524. \n\nThe eastern portion of the Long Island was inhabited by speakers of the [[Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language]] group of Algonquian languages; they were related to the [[Pequot people|Pequot]] and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett peoples]] of southern [[New England]]. The tribes of [[Long Island]] included the [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequas]], the [[Matinecocks]], the [[Nissequogue, New York|Nissequogues]], the [[Setalcott|Setaukets]], the [[Corchaug|Corchaugs]], the [[Secatogue|Secatogues]], the [[Poospatuck Reservation|Unkechaugs]], the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecocks]], the [[Montaukett|Montauketts]], and the [[Shelter Island, New York|Manhasets]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] documented the language of the [[Poospatuck Reservation|Unkechaug]] Tribe in 1790. \n\nFurther south were the traditional homes of the [[Powhatan]], a loose group of bands numbering into the tens of thousands, who were among the first to encounter English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay region. Historic people also included the [[Nanticoke tribe|Nanticoke]], [[Wicocomico]], [[Secotan]], [[Chowanoke]], [[Weapemeoc]], and [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]].\n\nThe southernmost Algonquin peoples were clustered around [[Pamlico Sound]] in what is now North Carolina, including the [[Pamplico]], [[Chowanoke]], and [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]].\n\n===Midwest===\nThe French encountered Algonquian peoples in this area through their trade and limited colonization of New France along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The historic peoples of the Illinois Country were the [[Shawnee]], [[Illiniwek]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Menominee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]]. The latter were also known as the Sac and Fox, and later known as the Meskwaki Indians, who lived throughout the present-day Midwest of the United States.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, many Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River were displaced over great distances through the United States passage and enforcement of [[Indian removal]] legislation; they forced the people west of the [[Mississippi River]] to what they designated as [[Indian Territory]]. After the US extinguished Indian land claims, this area was admitted as the state of [[Oklahoma]] in the early 20th century.\n\n===Upper west===\nOjibwe/Chippewa, [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]], and a variety of [[Cree]] groups lived in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Western Ontario]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and the [[Canadian Prairies]]. The [[Arapaho]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and [[Cheyenne]] developed as indigenous to the [[Great Plains]].\n\n===Western areas===\nAlgonquian peoples in the present states of Wyoming, Colorado, southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas were ancestors to the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]].<ref>Frink, Lisa.

When her mother, Rosario, died in 2011, she moved in with her father in his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] home.  She has two brothers, Ricardo and Alejandro. [[Ricardo Levins Morales]] is a well known poster artist and organizer and lives in Minneapolis, MN. Alejandro Levins is an entrepreneur in Western Massachusetts. The son of her brother Ricardo is [[Minneapolis]]-based hip hop artist [[Manny Phesto]].<ref>Tran, Kyle \"New Local Music\" [http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/blog/kyle-tran-myhre/new-local-music-manny-phesto-kraydio-psymun-medium-zach-lioness-and-more MN Daily Planet]</ref><ref>Thompson, Eric \"Top 10 Must See Music Videos This Week\" retrieved (8/4/15) [http://www.citypages.com/music/top-10-must-see-minnesota-music-videos-this-week-6638302 City Pages]</ref>\n\nLevins Morales became a public writer in the 1970s as a result of the many social justice movements of that time that addressed the importance of giving a voice to the oppressed. At age fifteen, she was the youngest member of the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]] and co-produced a [[feminist]] radio show, took part in sit-ins and demonstrations against the [[Vietnam War]], [[guerrilla theater]], women's [[consciousness raising]] groups, and door-to-door organizing for daycare and equal pay.\n\nShe attended [[Franconia College]] in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]]. Levins Morales also studied at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], and holds a Ph.D. in Women's Studies and History from [[Union Institute & University]], a non-residential graduate school based in Cincinnati, OH.<ref>Levins Morales, Aurora.

Ph.D. diss, The Union Institute, 1996. {{ISBN|9780599347144}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1976, she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where she worked at the [[KPFA]] Third World News Bureau, reporting on events in South Africa, the Philippines, Chile, Nicaragua and what was still Rhodesia, and on [[environmental racism]], housing struggles, and the movement to get the US Navy to stop bombing [[Vieques, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"mestizaje\">Lopez-Springfield, Consuelo. \u201cMestizaje in the Mother-Daughter Autobiography of Rosario Morales and Aurora Levins Morales\u201d A/b: Auto/Biography Studies 8 (Fall 1993): 303\u2013315.</ref>\n\nLevins Morales became part of a radical US women of color writers movement that sought to integrate the struggles against sexism and racism. She began doing coffeehouse readings with other women, organizing poetry series, producing radio programs, publishing in literary journals and anthologies, and eventually becoming one of the contributors to ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'', where she focuses on depicting the race, class, and gender issues that together shape Puerto Rican women's identities and historical experiences. Some of her major themes are feminism; multiple identity (Puerto Rican, Jewish, North American), immigrant experience, Jewish radicalism and history, Puerto Rican history, and the importance of collective memory, of history and art, in resisting oppression and creating social change.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1981, Levins Morales worked as co-founder, scriptwriter, and performer for La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Productions Group. The group created multimedia productions around the theme of Latin American politics and culture as a form of political activism.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Levins Morales|first1=Aurora|title=Aurora Levins Morales|url=http://www.auroralevinsmorales.com/uploads/4/2/9/2/4292077/2014_cv.docx|website=Aurora Levins Morales|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|title=Voices of Feminism Oral History Project|url=https://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/transcripts/LevinsMorales.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> In 1986, Levins Morales and her mother and wrote ''Getting Home Alive'', a collection of poetry and prose about their lives as US Puerto Rican women. Unfortunately, after the publication of this collection, Morales sustained a [[brain injury]] in a car accident. This accident set Morales back for a year, with struggles in performing daily tasks.<ref name=\"auto\">\u201cAurora Levins Morales.\u201d Voices From the Gaps, Regents of the University of Minnesota, 2009, https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/166279/Morales,%20Aurora%20Levin.pdf?sequence=1</ref> Levins Morales went to graduate school to become a historian. While her dissertation focused on retelling the history of the Atlantic world with Puerto Rican women's lives at the center, she also did extensive research on the history of Puerto Ricans in California, collecting several dozen oral histories, and preserving early documents of the San Francisco Puerto Rican community. From 1999 to 2002, she worked at the Oakland Museum of California as lead historian for the Latino Community History Project, working with high school students to collect oral histories and photographs, and create artwork and curriculum materials based on them.\n\nIn her collection of essays ''Medicine Stories: History, Culture, and the Politics of Integrity'' (1998,) Levins Morales questions traditional accounts of American history and their consistent exclusion of people of color. She argues that traditional historical narratives have had devastating  effects on those it has silenced, and oppressed. In an attempt to \u201cheal\u201d this historical trauma of oppression, she designs a \u201cmedicinal\u201d history that gives centrality to the marginalized, particularly Puerto Rican women. Levins Morales strives to make visible those who have been absent from history books while also emphasizing resistance efforts.<ref>Rojas, Lourdes. \"Latinas at the Crossroads: An Affirmation of Life in Rosario Morales and Aurora Levins Morales's Getting Home Alive.\" In Breaking Boundaries: Latina Writing and Critical Reading, edited by A.

Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1989.</ref>\n\nIn her book, ''Remedios: Stories of Earth and Iron from the History of Puertorrique\u00f1as'' (1998), her goal  is \u201cto unearth the names of women deemed unimportant by the writers of official histories\u201d(Levins Morales, p. xvii). Short pieces interspersed throughout the narratives describe medicinal herbs and foods that symbolize the healing properties of the narratives that follow those sections. In this manner she treats historical erasure as a disease that a curandera historian can heal through \u201chome-grown\u201d herbal history. The histories she portrays in the text demonstrate the strength and resistance of Puerto Rican women and their ancestors. \n\nLevins Morales is one of the 18 Latina feminist women who participated in the gatherings of the Latina Feminist Group, which culminated with the publication of ''Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios'' in 2001.<ref>Latina Feminist Group.

In 2015 she signed a contract with Duke University Press for a new edition of ''Medicine Stories'', subtitled ''Essays for Radicals'' which was released in April, 2019 with twelve new and nine substantially revised essays. In August, 2019 she published a collection of prose poems entitled Silt, about the Mississippi River and the Caribbean Sea, exploring their natural and social landscapes.  \n\nShe is a member of the advisory board of [[Jewish Voice for Peace]] and is active in the organization's Jews of Color Caucus. She is a contributing editor of Unruly.org, the online publication of the caucus.   \n====Disability and health activism====\nLevins Morales lives with multiple disabilities and chronic illnesses, including epilepsy, several brain injuries, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and Environmental Illness (also known as Multiple Chemical Sensitivities.) In 2007 she had a stroke and began using a wheelchair, which allowed her to become part of the disability arts community in the Bay Area.<ref name=\"auroralevinsmorales.com\">http://www.auroralevinsmorales.com</ref> In 2009 she became a commissioned artist with ''Sins Invalid'', a disabled artists' performance project that \"explores the themes of sexuality, embodiment and the disabled body\" and centers disabled artists of color and gender variant disabled artists.

During the last two decades, Levins has concentrated on application of [[ecology]] to [[agriculture]], particularly in the economically less-well-developed nations of this planet.  When her mother, Rosario, died in 2011, she moved in with her father in his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] home.  She has two brothers, Ricardo and Alejandro. [[Ricardo Levins Morales]] is a well known poster artist and organizer and lives in Minneapolis, MN. Alejandro Levins is an entrepreneur in Western Massachusetts. The son of her brother Ricardo is [[Minneapolis]]-based hip hop artist [[Manny Phesto]].<ref>Tran, Kyle \"New Local Music\" [http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/blog/kyle-tran-myhre/new-local-music-manny-phesto-kraydio-psymun-medium-zach-lioness-and-more MN Daily Planet]</ref><ref>Thompson, Eric \"Top 10 Must See Music Videos This Week\" retrieved (8/4/15) [http://www.citypages.com/music/top-10-must-see-minnesota-music-videos-this-week-6638302 City Pages]</ref>\n\nLevins Morales became a public writer in the 1970s as a result of the many social justice movements of that time that addressed the importance of giving a voice to the oppressed. At age fifteen, she was the youngest member of the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]] and co-produced a [[feminist]] radio show, took part in sit-ins and demonstrations against the [[Vietnam War]], [[guerrilla theater]], women's [[consciousness raising]] groups, and door-to-door organizing for daycare and equal pay.\n\nShe attended [[Franconia College]] in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]]. Levins Morales also studied at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], and holds a Ph.D. in Women's Studies and History from [[Union Institute & University]], a non-residential graduate school based in Cincinnati, OH.<ref>Levins Morales, Aurora.

She began doing coffeehouse readings with other women, organizing poetry series, producing radio programs, publishing in literary journals and anthologies, and eventually becoming one of the contributors to ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'', where she focuses on depicting the race, class, and gender issues that together shape Puerto Rican women's identities and historical experiences. Some of her major themes are feminism; multiple identity (Puerto Rican, Jewish, North American), immigrant experience, Jewish radicalism and history, Puerto Rican history, and the importance of collective memory, of history and art, in resisting oppression and creating social change.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1981, Levins Morales worked as co-founder, scriptwriter, and performer for La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Productions Group. The group created multimedia productions around the theme of Latin American politics and culture as a form of political activism.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Levins Morales|first1=Aurora|title=Aurora Levins Morales|url=http://www.auroralevinsmorales.com/uploads/4/2/9/2/4292077/2014_cv.docx|website=Aurora Levins Morales|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|title=Voices of Feminism Oral History Project|url=https://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/transcripts/LevinsMorales.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> In 1986, Levins Morales and her mother and wrote ''Getting Home Alive'', a collection of poetry and prose about their lives as US Puerto Rican women. Unfortunately, after the publication of this collection, Morales sustained a [[brain injury]] in a car accident. This accident set Morales back for a year, with struggles in performing daily tasks.<ref name=\"auto\">\u201cAurora Levins Morales.\u201d Voices From the Gaps, Regents of the University of Minnesota, 2009, https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/166279/Morales,%20Aurora%20Levin.pdf?sequence=1</ref> Levins Morales went to graduate school to become a historian. While her dissertation focused on retelling the history of the Atlantic world with Puerto Rican women's lives at the center, she also did extensive research on the history of Puerto Ricans in California, collecting several dozen oral histories, and preserving early documents of the San Francisco Puerto Rican community. From 1999 to 2002, she worked at the Oakland Museum of California as lead historian for the Latino Community History Project, working with high school students to collect oral histories and photographs, and create artwork and curriculum materials based on them.\n\nIn her collection of essays ''Medicine Stories: History, Culture, and the Politics of Integrity'' (1998,) Levins Morales questions traditional accounts of American history and their consistent exclusion of people of color. She argues that traditional historical narratives have had devastating  effects on those it has silenced, and oppressed. In an attempt to \u201cheal\u201d this historical trauma of oppression, she designs a \u201cmedicinal\u201d history that gives centrality to the marginalized, particularly Puerto Rican women. Levins Morales strives to make visible those who have been absent from history books while also emphasizing resistance efforts.<ref>Rojas, Lourdes. \"Latinas at the Crossroads: An Affirmation of Life in Rosario Morales and Aurora Levins Morales's Getting Home Alive.\" In Breaking Boundaries: Latina Writing and Critical Reading, edited by A.

Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1989.</ref>\n\nIn her book, ''Remedios: Stories of Earth and Iron from the History of Puertorrique\u00f1as'' (1998), her goal  is \u201cto unearth the names of women deemed unimportant by the writers of official histories\u201d(Levins Morales, p. xvii). Short pieces interspersed throughout the narratives describe medicinal herbs and foods that symbolize the healing properties of the narratives that follow those sections. In this manner she treats historical erasure as a disease that a curandera historian can heal through \u201chome-grown\u201d herbal history. The histories she portrays in the text demonstrate the strength and resistance of Puerto Rican women and their ancestors. \n\nLevins Morales is one of the 18 Latina feminist women who participated in the gatherings of the Latina Feminist Group, which culminated with the publication of ''Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios'' in 2001.<ref>Latina Feminist Group.

In 2015 she signed a contract with Duke University Press for a new edition of ''Medicine Stories'', subtitled ''Essays for Radicals'' which was released in April, 2019 with twelve new and nine substantially revised essays. In August, 2019 she published a collection of prose poems entitled Silt, about the Mississippi River and the Caribbean Sea, exploring their natural and social landscapes.  \n\nShe is a member of the advisory board of [[Jewish Voice for Peace]] and is active in the organization's Jews of Color Caucus. She is a contributing editor of Unruly.org, the online publication of the caucus.   \n====Disability and health activism====\nLevins Morales lives with multiple disabilities and chronic illnesses, including epilepsy, several brain injuries, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and Environmental Illness (also known as Multiple Chemical Sensitivities.) In 2007 she had a stroke and began using a wheelchair, which allowed her to become part of the disability arts community in the Bay Area.<ref name=\"auroralevinsmorales.com\">http://www.auroralevinsmorales.com</ref> In 2009 she became a commissioned artist with ''Sins Invalid'', a disabled artists' performance project that \"explores the themes of sexuality, embodiment and the disabled body\" and centers disabled artists of color and gender variant disabled artists.

Specifically, the deaths of individuals such as [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], [[Death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]], and [[Shooting of Tamir Rice|Tamir Rice]] sparked a need for the conference among the African-American community. During the three day conference (July 24\u201326), activists participated in discussions, viewed short films, and engaged in workshops designed to mobilize individuals seeking to find solutions to the problems that black communities face. The [[Cleveland State University]] convention is considered the first major gathering of the Movement for Black Lives as more than 1500 individuals attended the conference. Subsequently, activists from the convention embarked on a mission to establish the official Movement for Black Lives organization as well as establish a policy platform that could guide activists from around the country in their fight to end police brutality and discrimination against blacks within the United States.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standingonthesideoflove.org/ourstories/a-transformative-experience|title=The Movement For Black Lives Convening In Cleveland\u2014A Transformative Experience|work=Standing on the Side of Love|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe conference gained even more national media attention when, on the last day of the convention, a Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA) officer maced a crowd of primarily African-American activists just blocks away from [[Cleveland State University]]. The crowd had gathered in response to an RTA officer's detention of an African-American teen for intoxication. According to authorities, the teenager was unable to \"care for himself\" due to his level of intoxication, and thus the authorities thought it was necessary to take him into custody. During the teenager's detention a crowd gathered around the police cruiser to protest the detention of the teen; in order to clear the crowd from the path of the police cruiser, \"a Transit Police officer used a general burst of pepper spray\" directed toward the activists. The incident drew criticism as interest groups, such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU of Ohio]], believed \"the use of pepper spray by law enforcement as a means of crowd control is questionable.\"<ref>\"ACLU Questions RTA Police Pepper Spray Incident at Close of Movement for Black Lives Convening.\"'' Targeted News Service'', Jul 30, 2015'', ProQuest Newsstand; Research Library.''</ref><ref>Yang, Jessica. \"RTA Officer Pepper Sprays Movement for Black Lives Gathering at CSU.\"'' University Wire'', Jul 30, 2015'', ProQuest Newsstand.''</ref><ref>Larimer, Sarah.

Organizations such as the [[National Council of Asian Pacific Americans]], [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU of Northern California]], and even the [[National Council of Jewish Women]] showed support for the Movement for Black Lives by issuing public statements following the movement's controversial publication of its platform. The Movement for Black Lives' call for criminal justice reform and the end of police brutality resonated with many advocacy groups. In one statement, the National Council of Jewish Women stated, \"NCJW affirms that Black lives matter, including Jews of color, who are a vital part of both the Jewish and our NCJW community.

They are usually accompanied by [[Wind|strong winds]], and often produce [[heavy rain (meteorology)|heavy rain]] and sometimes [[Thundersnow|snow]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]], or [[hail]], but some thunderstorms produce little precipitation or [[Dry thunderstorm|no precipitation]] at all. Thunderstorms may [[thunderstorm training|line up in a series]] or become a [[rainband]], known as a [[squall line]]. Strong or [[#Severe thunderstorms|severe thunderstorm]]s include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and [[tornado]]es. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as [[supercell]]s, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the [[troposphere]] that they occupy, vertical [[wind shear]] sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.\n\nThunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a [[Weather front|front]]. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, [[condense]]s, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over {{convert|20|km|mi}}. As the rising air reaches its [[dew point]] temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a [[downdraft]] as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.\n\nThunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the [[Mid-latitudes|mid-latitude]], where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.<ref name=\"nssl.noaa.gov\">{{cite web|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|author-link=National Severe Storms Laboratory|title=SEVERE WEATHER 101 / Thunderstorm Basics|url=https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/thunderstorms/ |work=SEVERE WEATHER 101|accessdate=2020-01-02}}</ref> Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by [[downburst]] winds, large hailstones, and [[flash flooding]] caused by heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and [[waterspout]]s.\n\nThere are four types of thunderstorms: [[Air-mass thunderstorm|single-cell]], [[Multicellular thunderstorm|multi-cell cluster]], multi-cell lines and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. [[Mesoscale convective system]]s formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] can be responsible for the development of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s. [[Dry thunderstorm]]s, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of [[wildfire]]s from the heat generated from the [[cloud-to-ground lightning]] that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: [[weather radar]], [[weather station]]s, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the [[18th century]]. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Neptune]], and, probably, [[Venus]].\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Thunderstorm formation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Stages of a thunderstorm's life.]]\n{{see also|Cloud}}\n\nWarm air has a lower [[density]] than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/civilengineersp00fryegoog |title=Civil engineers' pocket book: a reference-book for engineers, contractors|author=Albert Irvin Frye|page=[https://archive.org/details/civilengineersp00fryegoog/page/n500 462]|publisher=D.

During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be [[insolation|solar illumination]], where the heating of the ground produces [[thermals]], or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as ''[[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]]'' clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, [[latent heat]] is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an ''[[updraft]]'' through the process of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] (hence the term [[Precipitation (meteorology)|convective precipitation]]). This process creates a [[low pressure area|low-pressure zone]] within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the [[Earth's atmosphere]].<ref name=\"condensationenergy\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |title=Rough Values of Various Processes |author=Gianfranco Vidali |date=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[University of Syracuse]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315113421/http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mature stage ===\n[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2||Anvil-shaped thundercloud in the mature stage]]\n\nIn the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the [[tropopause]]. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic [[anvil]] shape. The resulting cloud is called ''[[cumulonimbus incus]]''. The water droplets [[coalescence (meteorology)|coalesce]] into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become [[rain]]. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as [[hail]]. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating ''[[downdrafts]]'' as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal [[turbulence]] can occur, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even [[tornado]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotsweb.com/wx/w_sense.htm |title=Structural Icing in VMC|author=Pilot's Web The Aviator's Journal|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref>\n\nTypically, if there is little [[wind shear]], the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out',<ref name=\"Extreme Weather\" /> but, if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction, the downdraft will be separated from the updraft, and the storm may become a [[supercell]], where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.<ref name=\"motion\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Dissipating stage ===\n[[File:Single-cell Thunderstorm in a No-shear Environment..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|A thunderstorm in an environment with no winds to shear the storm or blow the anvil in any one direction]]\n\nIn the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20\u201330 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a [[downburst]]. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Weather World 2010 Project|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/comp/wind/home.rxml|title=Vertical Wind Shear|accessdate=2006-10-21|date=2009-09-03}}</ref> The downdraft hitting the ground creates an [[outflow boundary]]. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the [[outflow boundary]] is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.<ref>{{cite book|author=T. T.

Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere (\"[[wind shear]]\"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20\u201330 minutes.\n\nOrganized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, normally greater than {{convert|25|kn|m/s}} in the lowest {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the [[troposphere]],<ref>Markowski, Paul and Yvette Richardson.  Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes.  John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2010.\npp. 209.</ref> which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather.

Also known as [[air-mass thunderstorm]]s, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a [[weather fronts|cold front]] from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term \"cell\" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term \"air mass thunderstorm\". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20\u201330&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"tsbasics\"/>\n\n===Multi-cell clusters===\n{{Main|Multicellular thunderstorm}}\n[[File:8402 STS41B Challenger Thunderstorms over Brazil.JPG|thumb|A group of thunderstorms over [[Brazil]] photographed by the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]].]]\n\nThis is the most common type of thunderstorm development. ''Mature thunderstorms'' are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. ''Multicell storms'' form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more [[squall line]]s. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20&nbsp;minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm.

Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's [[troposphere]], the lowest {{convert|8|km|mi}} of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical [[wind shear]] vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On [[weather radar]], storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.<ref name=\"motion\"/>\n\n===Back-building thunderstorm===\nA back-building thunderstorm, commonly referred to as a [[Training (meteorology)|training thunderstorm]], is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/mcsflashflood_2015feb07.ppt|title=MCS Movement and Behavior (PowerPoint)|author=Stephen Corfidi|publisher=National Weather Service, Storm Prediction Center|date=2015-02-04|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tstorms/tstrmtypes.htm|title=Types of Thunderstorms|author=National Weather Service|author-link=National Weather Service|publisher=National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible.

Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments, where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced.

Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.<ref name=\"Extreme Weather\" />\n\n===Thunderstorm asthma===\n{{Main|Thunderstorm asthma}}\n\nThunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm.

Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes associated thunderstorms with the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], who they believed was a servant of the [[Great Spirit]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] considered thunderstorms to occur when [[Thor]] went to fight [[J\u00f6tunn|J\u00f6tnar]], with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]]. [[Hinduism]] recognizes [[Indra]] as the god of rain and thunderstorms. [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine accepts that fierce storms are the work of [[God]].

They are usually accompanied by [[Wind|strong winds]], and often produce [[heavy rain (meteorology)|heavy rain]] and sometimes [[Thundersnow|snow]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]], or [[hail]], but some thunderstorms produce little precipitation or [[Dry thunderstorm|no precipitation]] at all. Thunderstorms may [[thunderstorm training|line up in a series]] or become a [[rainband]], known as a [[squall line]]. Strong or [[#Severe thunderstorms|severe thunderstorm]]s include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and [[tornado]]es. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as [[supercell]]s, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the [[troposphere]] that they occupy, vertical [[wind shear]] sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.\n\nThunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a [[Weather front|front]]. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, [[condense]]s, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over {{convert|20|km|mi}}. As the rising air reaches its [[dew point]] temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a [[downdraft]] as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.\n\nThunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the [[Mid-latitudes|mid-latitude]], where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.<ref name=\"nssl.noaa.gov\">{{cite web|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|author-link=National Severe Storms Laboratory|title=SEVERE WEATHER 101 / Thunderstorm Basics|url=https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/thunderstorms/ |work=SEVERE WEATHER 101|accessdate=2020-01-02}}</ref> Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by [[downburst]] winds, large hailstones, and [[flash flooding]] caused by heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and [[waterspout]]s.\n\nThere are four types of thunderstorms: [[Air-mass thunderstorm|single-cell]], [[Multicellular thunderstorm|multi-cell cluster]], multi-cell lines and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. [[Mesoscale convective system]]s formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] can be responsible for the development of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s. [[Dry thunderstorm]]s, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of [[wildfire]]s from the heat generated from the [[cloud-to-ground lightning]] that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: [[weather radar]], [[weather station]]s, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the [[18th century]]. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Neptune]], and, probably, [[Venus]].\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Thunderstorm formation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Stages of a thunderstorm's life.]]\n{{see also|Cloud}}\n\nWarm air has a lower [[density]] than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/civilengineersp00fryegoog |title=Civil engineers' pocket book: a reference-book for engineers, contractors|author=Albert Irvin Frye|page=[https://archive.org/details/civilengineersp00fryegoog/page/n500 462]|publisher=D.

During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be [[insolation|solar illumination]], where the heating of the ground produces [[thermals]], or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as ''[[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]]'' clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, [[latent heat]] is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an ''[[updraft]]'' through the process of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] (hence the term [[Precipitation (meteorology)|convective precipitation]]). This process creates a [[low pressure area|low-pressure zone]] within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the [[Earth's atmosphere]].<ref name=\"condensationenergy\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |title=Rough Values of Various Processes |author=Gianfranco Vidali |date=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[University of Syracuse]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315113421/http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mature stage ===\n[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2||Anvil-shaped thundercloud in the mature stage]]\n\nIn the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the [[tropopause]]. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic [[anvil]] shape. The resulting cloud is called ''[[cumulonimbus incus]]''. The water droplets [[coalescence (meteorology)|coalesce]] into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become [[rain]]. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as [[hail]]. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating ''[[downdrafts]]'' as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal [[turbulence]] can occur, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even [[tornado]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotsweb.com/wx/w_sense.htm |title=Structural Icing in VMC|author=Pilot's Web The Aviator's Journal|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref>\n\nTypically, if there is little [[wind shear]], the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out',<ref name=\"Extreme Weather\" /> but, if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction, the downdraft will be separated from the updraft, and the storm may become a [[supercell]], where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.<ref name=\"motion\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Dissipating stage ===\n[[File:Single-cell Thunderstorm in a No-shear Environment..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|A thunderstorm in an environment with no winds to shear the storm or blow the anvil in any one direction]]\n\nIn the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20\u201330 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a [[downburst]]. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Weather World 2010 Project|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/comp/wind/home.rxml|title=Vertical Wind Shear|accessdate=2006-10-21|date=2009-09-03}}</ref> The downdraft hitting the ground creates an [[outflow boundary]]. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the [[outflow boundary]] is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.<ref>{{cite book|author=T. T.

Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere (\"[[wind shear]]\"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20\u201330 minutes.\n\nOrganized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, normally greater than {{convert|25|kn|m/s}} in the lowest {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the [[troposphere]],<ref>Markowski, Paul and Yvette Richardson.  Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes.  John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2010.\npp. 209.</ref> which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation.  [[Precipitable water]] values of greater than {{convert|31.8|mm|in}} favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes.<ref>Maddox, R.A., C.F. Chappell, and L.R. Hoxit, (1979).

Also known as [[air-mass thunderstorm]]s, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a [[weather fronts|cold front]] from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term \"cell\" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term \"air mass thunderstorm\". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20\u201330&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"tsbasics\"/>\n\n===Multi-cell clusters===\n{{Main article|Multicellular thunderstorm}}\n[[File:8402 STS41B Challenger Thunderstorms over Brazil.JPG|thumb|A group of thunderstorms over [[Brazil]] photographed by the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]].]]\n\nThis is the most common type of thunderstorm development. ''Mature thunderstorms'' are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. ''Multicell storms'' form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more [[squall line]]s. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20&nbsp;minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time.

Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's [[troposphere]], the lowest {{convert|8|km|mi}} of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical [[wind shear]] vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On [[weather radar]], storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.<ref name=\"motion\"/>\n\n===Back-building thunderstorm===\nA back-building thunderstorm, commonly referred to as a [[Training (meteorology)|training thunderstorm]], is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/mcsflashflood_2015feb07.ppt|title=MCS Movement and Behavior (PowerPoint)|author=Stephen Corfidi|publisher=National Weather Service, Storm Prediction Center|date=2015-02-04|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tstorms/tstrmtypes.htm|title=Types of Thunderstorms|author=National Weather Service|author-link=National Weather Service|publisher=National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible.

Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments, where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced.

Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.<ref name=\"Extreme Weather\" />\n\n===Thunderstorm asthma===\n{{Main article|Thunderstorm asthma}}\n\nThunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm.

Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes associated thunderstorms with the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], who they believed was a servant of the [[Great Spirit]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] considered thunderstorms to occur when [[Thor]] went to fight [[J\u00f6tunn|J\u00f6tnar]], with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]]. [[Hinduism]] recognizes [[Indra]] as the god of rain and thunderstorms. [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine accepts that fierce storms are the work of [[God]]. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=John D.

He was also influenced by Eugene Bonner, whom he recalled as \"very political, very aware of Black issues and foreign issues. He was a real nationalist, a union man too.\" He met Bonner through his daughter, [[Joan Jones|Joan]], who also encouraged Jones's political development and reading interests.

The construction began around 1982 and it was opened to service on December 11, 1988.\n\nThis underground, two-level station was originally named '''Sutphin Boulevard''', and served as a replacement for the former [[Sutphin Boulevard (BMT Jamaica Line)|Sutphin Boulevard elevated station]] on the demolished segment of the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] two blocks north. When the AirTrain opened, the '''JFK Airport''' suffix was added.

World War II was wide ranging in its destruction of humans, animals, and materials. The postwar effects of World War II, both ecological and social, are still visible decades after the conflict ended. \n\nDuring World War II, new technology was used to create aircraft, which were used to conduct air raids. During the war, aircraft were used to transport resources both to and from different military bases and drop bombs on enemy, neutral, and friendly targets alike. These activities damaged habitats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evenden|first=Matthew|date=2011|title=Aluminum, commodity chain, and the environmental history of the second world war|url=|journal=Environmental History|volume=|pages=69\u201393|via=}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to wildlife, ecosystems also suffer from [[noise pollution]] which is produced by military aircraft. During World War II, aircraft acted as a vector for the transportation of exotics whereby weeds and cultivated species were brought to oceanic island ecosystems by way of aircraft landing strips which were used as refueling and staging stations during operations in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|date=1968|title=Catastrophic human interference with coral atoll ecosystems|url=|journal=Geography|volume=|pages=25\u201340|via=}}</ref> Before the war, the isolated islands around Europe were inhabited by a high number of endemic species.

About 70,000 people died in the first nine seconds after the bombing of Hiroshima, which was comparable to the death toll which resulted from the devastating [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Operation Meetinghouse]] air raid over Tokyo.

Behind the combat zones, timber from cut down trees was removed in order to clear up the paths for fighting. The shattered forests in the battle zones faced exploitation.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Richard|date=2012|title=War and the Environment|url=|journal=A Companion to Global Environmental History|volume=|pages=319\u2013339|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavily hazardous chemicals was first initiated during World War II.<ref name=\":3\" /> The long-term effects of chemicals result from both their potential persistence and the poor disposal program of nations with stockpiled weapons.<ref name=\":0\" /> During [[World War I]] (WW I), German chemists developed chlorine gas and mustard gas. The development of these gases led to many casualties, and lands were poisoned both on and near the battlefields.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nLater in World War II, chemists developed even more harmful chemical bombs, which were packaged in barrels and directly deposited in the oceans.<ref name=\":0\" /> The disposal of the chemicals in ocean runs the risk of metal-based containers corroding and leaching the chemical contents of the vessel into the ocean.<ref name=\":0\" /> Through the chemical disposal in the ocean, the contaminates may be spread throughout the various components of the ecosystems damaging marine and terrestrial ecosystems.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMarine ecosystems during World War II were damaged not only from chemical contaminates, but also from wreckage from naval ships, which leaked oil into the water. Oil contamination in the Atlantic Ocean due to World War II shipwrecks is estimated at over 15 million tonnes.<ref name=\":0\" /> Oil spills are difficult to clean up and take many years to clean. To this day, traces of oil can still be found in the Atlantic Ocean from the naval shipwrecks which happened during World War II. \n\nThe use of chemicals during war helped increase the scale of chemical industries and it also helped to show the government the value of scientific research to the government. The development of chemical research during the war also lead to the postwar development of agricultural pesticides.<ref name=\":3\" /> The creation of pesticides was an upside for the years after the war. \n\nThe environmental impacts of World War II were very drastic, which allowed them to be seen in the Cold War and be seen today. The impacts of conflict, chemical contaminations, and aerial warfare all contribute to reduction in the population of global flora and fauna, as well as a reduction in species diversity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1946, in the U.S. Zone of Germany, the United States military advised the government to prepare accommodations and employment for the people who were bombed out of their cities. The answer was a special garden program that would provide new land for the people to live in. This included land to provide food needed for the people as well. Forests were then surveyed for good soil that was suitable for crop production.This meant that the forest would be cut down in order to make land for farms and housing.The forestry program would be used to exploit the forests of Germany for future resources and control the war potential of Germany. In this program about 23,500,000 fest meters of lumber were produced out of the forests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&entity=History.YearPotsdam.p0073&id=History.YearPotsdam&isize=M|title=History: A year of Potsdam, the German economy since the surrender: How 17,000,000 Germans are fed|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Gulf War and Iraq War===\n{{Main|Environmental impact of Gulf wars}}\nDuring the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] were a result of the scorched earth policy of Iraqi forces retreating from [[Kuwait]].

[[Scorched earth]] methods have been used for much of recorded history. However, the methods of modern warfare cause far greater devastation on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The progression of warfare from [[chemical weapons]] to [[nuclear weapons]] has increasingly created stress on [[ecosystems]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Specific examples of the environmental impact of war include: [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Rwandan Civil War]], the [[Kosovo War]] and the [[Gulf War]].\n\n==Historical events==\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n[[File:'Ranch Hand' run.jpg|thumb|Defoliant spray run, part of Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War by UC-123B Provider aircraft]]\nThe [[Vietnam War]] had significant environmental implications due to chemical agents which were used to destroy militarily-significant vegetation.

The war created a massive migration of nearly 2 million Hutus fleeing [[Rwanda]] over the course of just a few weeks to [[refugee camps]] in [[Tanzania]] and now modern-day [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref name=\"dw\" /> This large displacement of people in refugee camps puts pressure on the surrounding [[ecosystem]]. Forests were cleared in order to provide wood for building shelters and creating cooking fires:<ref name=\"dw\" /> \u201cthese people suffered from harsh conditions and constituted an important threat impact to natural resources.\u201d<ref name=\"sk\" /> Consequences from the conflict also included the degradation of National Parks and Reserves. Another big problem was the population crash in Rwanda shifted personnel and capital to other parts of the country, thereby making it hard to protect wildlife.<ref name=\"sk\" />\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] (WWII) drove a vast increase in production, militarized the production and transportation of commodities, and introduced many new environmental consequences, which can still be seen today. World War II was wide ranging in its destruction of humans, animals, and materials. The postwar effects of World War II, both ecological and social, are still visible decades after the conflict ended. \n\nDuring World War II, new technology was used to create aircraft, which were used to conduct air raids. During the war, aircraft were used to transport resources both to and from different military bases and drop bombs on enemy, neutral, and friendly targets alike. These activities damaged habitats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evenden|first=Matthew|date=2011|title=Aluminum, commodity chain, and the environmental history of the second world war|url=|journal=Environmental History|volume=|pages=69\u201393|via=}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to wildlife, ecosystems also suffer from [[noise pollution]] which is produced by military aircraft. During World War II, aircraft acted as a vector for the transportation of exotics whereby weeds and cultivated species were brought to oceanic island ecosystems by way of aircraft landing strips which were used as refueling and staging stations during operations in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|date=1968|title=Catastrophic human interference with coral atoll ecosystems|url=|journal=Geography|volume=|pages=25\u201340|via=}}</ref> Before the war, the isolated islands around Europe were inhabited by a high number of endemic species.

About 70,000 people died in the first nine seconds after the bombing of Hiroshima, which was comparable to the death toll which resulted from the devastating [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Operation Meetinghouse]] air raid over Tokyo. Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on the industrial city of Nagasaki, instantly killing 35,000 people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjenvironmentaljustice.org/atomic-bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/|title=Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 SJ Environmental Justice}}</ref> The [[nuclear weapon]]s released catastrophic loads of energy. Once the bombs were blasted, the temperatures reached about 7200\u00b0F.<ref name=\":1\" /> With temperatures that high, all the flora and fauna were destroyed along with the infrastructure and human lives in the impact zones.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs]] were dropped, they released enormous quantities of energy and radioactive particles.

Behind the combat zones, timber from cut down trees was removed in order to clear up the paths for fighting. The shattered forests in the battle zones faced exploitation.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Richard|date=2012|title=War and the Environment|url=|journal=A Companion to Global Environmental History|volume=|pages=319\u2013339|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavily hazardous chemicals was first initiated during World War II.<ref name=\":3\" /> The long-term effects of chemicals result from both their potential persistence and the poor disposal program of nations with stockpiled weapons.<ref name=\":0\" /> During [[World War I]] (WW I), German chemists developed chlorine gas and mustard gas. The development of these gases led to many casualties, and lands were poisoned both on and near the battlefields.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nLater in World War II, chemists developed even more harmful chemical bombs, which were packaged in barrels and directly deposited in the oceans.<ref name=\":0\" /> The disposal of the chemicals in ocean runs the risk of metal-based containers corroding and leaching the chemical contents of the vessel into the ocean.<ref name=\":0\" /> Through the chemical disposal in the ocean, the contaminates may be spread throughout the various components of the ecosystems damaging marine and terrestrial ecosystems.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMarine ecosystems during World War II were damaged not only from chemical contaminates, but also from wreckage from naval ships, which leaked oil into the water. Oil contamination in the Atlantic Ocean due to World War II shipwrecks is estimated at over 15 million tonnes.<ref name=\":0\" /> Oil spills are difficult to clean up and take many years to clean. To this day, traces of oil can still be found in the Atlantic Ocean from the naval shipwrecks which happened during World War II. \n\nThe use of chemicals during war helped increase the scale of chemical industries and it also helped to show the government the value of scientific research to the government. The development of chemical research during the war also lead to the postwar development of agricultural pesticides.<ref name=\":3\" /> The creation of pesticides was an upside for the years after the war. \n\nThe environmental impacts of World War II were very drastic, which allowed them to be seen in the Cold War and be seen today. The impacts of conflict, chemical contaminations, and aerial warfare all contribute to reduction in the population of global flora and fauna, as well as a reduction in species diversity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1946, in the U.S. Zone of Germany, the United States military advised the government to prepare accommodations and employment for the people who were bombed out of their cities. The answer was a special garden program that would provide new land for the people to live in. This included land to provide food needed for the people as well. Forests were then surveyed for good soil that was suitable for crop production.This meant that the forest would be cut down in order to make land for farms and housing.The forestry program would be used to exploit the forests of Germany for future resources and control the war potential of Germany. In this program about 23,500,000 fest meters of lumber were produced out of the forests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&entity=History.YearPotsdam.p0073&id=History.YearPotsdam&isize=M|title=History: A year of Potsdam, the German economy since the surrender: How 17,000,000 Germans are fed|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Gulf War and Iraq War===\n{{Main|Environmental impact of Gulf wars}}\nDuring the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] were a result of the scorched earth policy of Iraqi forces retreating from [[Kuwait]]. The [[Gulf War oil spill]], regarded as the worst oil spill in history, was caused when Iraqi forces opened valves at the Sea Island oil terminal and dumped oil from several tankers into the [[Persian Gulf]]. Oil was also dumped in the middle of the desert.\n\nJust before the 2003 Iraq War, Iraq also set fire to various oil fields.<ref>http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf</ref><ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx</ref>\n\nSome American military personnel complained of [[Gulf War syndrome]], typified by symptoms including immune system disorders and birth defects in their children.

Nixon]]. After the [[American Independent Party]] campaign, Turnipseed, like Wallace, returned to the Democratic Party. Turnipseed soon embraced the party's liberal majority wing and joined the [[interest group]], [[Americans for Democratic Action]], founded in 1947 by, among others, Hubert Humphrey, [[Walter Reuther]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=turnipseed/>\n\nTurnipseed was elected to the South Carolina Senate, serving from 1976 to 1980. That year he was the Democratic nominee for [[South Carolina's 2nd congressional district]]. He was defeated by the incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Floyd D. Spence]], a former Democrat and lawyer from Columbia who benefited from the [[Ronald W. Reagan]] presidential campaign that year. In the Spence-Turnipseed race, Republican strategist [[Lee Atwater]] planted questions with reporters about Turnipseed's treatment as a teenager for [[depression (mood disorder)|depression]].<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/21/forced-abortions-and-other-south-carolina-dirty-tricks.html Ben Johnson, \"Forced abortions and other South Carolina dirty tricks\"], ''The Daily Beast'', 21 January 2012, accessed 9 May 2015</ref> Atwater conducted a [[push poll]] against the Democrat, reminding voters of the state senator's involvement with the [[NAACP]].

Frye Gaillard of the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]'' described him as \"angry and shrill, and even some of the people who agreed with him finally wished he'd go away. He tried to change his style for [this] campaign, but it was apparently too late. That's a shame, however, because politics can do with a little more passion.

He was the founding chairman of the [[Citizens' Local Environmental Action Network]] (CLEAN), a statewide umbrella and informational clearing house for local citizens' groups concerned with toxic waste dumps in their areas. Turnipseed argues that \"[[environmental racism]] and classism\" lead to toxic waste sites being located disproportionately in minority and poorer communities. He has argued that toxic wastes constantly migrate through the air, water, and soil and eventually threaten all persons.\n\n==Media host and author==\nTurnipseed has hosted radio shows on WCAY, WCTG, WCEO, and WOIC. He has also hosted a television show on WIS TV. In both formats, his programs provide a forum for discussing diverse issues.

Nixon]]. After the [[American Independent Party]] campaign, Turnipseed, like Wallace, returned to the Democratic Party. Turnipseed soon embraced the party's liberal majority wing and joined the [[interest group]], [[Americans for Democratic Action]], founded in 1947 by, among others, Hubert Humphrey, [[Walter Reuther]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=turnipseed/>\n\nTurnipseed was elected to the South Carolina Senate, serving from 1976 to 1980. That year he was the Democratic nominee for [[South Carolina's 2nd congressional district]]. He was defeated by the incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Floyd D. Spence]], a former Democrat and lawyer from Columbia who benefited from the [[Ronald W. Reagan]] presidential campaign that year. In the Spence-Turnipseed race, Republican strategist [[Lee Atwater]] planted questions with reporters about Turnipseed's treatment as a teenager for [[depression (mood disorder)|depression]].<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/21/forced-abortions-and-other-south-carolina-dirty-tricks.html Ben Johnson, \"Forced abortions and other South Carolina dirty tricks\"], ''The Daily Beast'', 21 January 2012, accessed 9 May 2015</ref> Atwater conducted a [[push poll]] against the Democrat, reminding voters of the state senator's involvement with the [[NAACP]]. A decade later, prior to his own early death from brain cancer, Atwater wrote to Turnipseed to ask for forgiveness for his actions.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74674716.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+16%2C+1991&author=Tom+Turnipseed&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=a.19&desc=What+Lee+Atwater+Learned%3B+And+the+lesson+for+his+prote%27ge%27s.

Frye Gaillard of the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]'' described him as \"angry and shrill, and even some of the people who agreed with him finally wished he'd go away. He tried to change his style for [this] campaign, but it was apparently too late. That's a shame, however, because politics can do with a little more passion. And particularly so when that sense of being right comes, as Turnipseed's did, from a deeply felt knowledge of what it means to be wrong.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beck.library.emory.edu/southernchanges/article.php?id=sc04-4_008|title=Laments on the Demise of Tom Turnipseed|publisher=beck.library.emory.edu|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Turnipseed ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for [[Attorney General of South Carolina]]. Though he won twenty-six counties and finished with more than 46 percent of the vote, Turnipseed was defeated by the incumbent Republican [[Charlie Condon]].
