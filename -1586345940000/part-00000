The family moved to [[London]]. He began writing plays in 1985.\n\n===HAC period===\nIn 1986 aged 19, Bancil joined Hounslow Arts Co-op. One of four professional British Asian theatre companies at the time, HAC was the only one to be telling stories from a 2nd generation British Asian perspective. While most were writing about partition, or leaving their homeland, Parv Bancil was writing about his world, and tackling issues that were affecting British Asian youth, such as gang culture, drugs, crime and identity. From 1986 to 1989 he wrote four plays: ''Curse Of The Dead Dog'' (1986), ''How's Your Skull Does It Fit'' (1987), ''Kings'' (1988) and ''Bad Company'' (1989). And he quickly gained a reputation as a dynamic, uncompromising and controversial writer, long before it was fashionable. He also acted in many plays, was the founder member of One Nation Under A Groove Innit, (an umbrella organization that produced comedy), was one half of a comic double act called The Khrai Twins, based on two bumbling drunken Southall gangsters, and a member of a comedy trio called the Sycophantic Sponge Bunch. He was also part of a spoof rock band called The Dead Jalebies. Formed in 1987, they toured nationally and opened for [[Asian Dub Foundation]] in 1991 at the Camden Underworld. They also supported the [[Voodoo Queens]] in 1993.\n\n===''Nadir''===\nIn 1991 he was the recipient of a [[BBC Radio 4]] Young Playwright Award for his play ''Nadir'', about a young second generation Asian man fresh out of prison. It was produced and directed by [[Frances-Anne Solomon]], and performed by actors [[Rita Wolf]], [[Nina Wadia]], Neran Persaud and Ravinder Gill. \"I wrote a play for BBC Radio set in the near future when Britain was being run by an extreme right-wing government. Everyone had to swear allegiance to the country and if they didn't adhere to British culture they were not welcome. The BBC tried to ban it until four producers stood by me and put their necks on the line for it. The critics said it was laughable, that it would never happen. But now we have an immigration policy and people do have to swear allegiance to the flag (the so-called Britishness test where applicants for citizenship have to demonstrate a knowledge and integration of British culture).\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+living+black+and+white;+THEATRE+Parv+Bancil+tells+Alison+Jones+how...-a0165993873|title=In living black and white; THEATRE Parv Bancil tells Alison Jones how events in Lozells inspired his latest play.|last=Jones|first=Alison|website=Free Online Library|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===''Ungrateful Dead''===\nBy this point HAC had disbanded. But in 1993 Bancil wrote ''Ungrateful Dead'', a play about a young Sikh man's descent into a world of gangs, violence and drugs. The play had a huge impact on audiences, and lead to a residency at The Royal Court Theatre.\n\n===''Papa Was A Bus Conductor''===\nIn 1995 Bancil wrote ''Papa Was A Bus Conductor'', a comedy satire about a dysfunctional family that was an early flowering of the British Asian comedy boom that spawned Goodness Gracious Me. It was his first play to receive a TimeOut Critics Choice. And it was the first of its kind to spark a trend for a whole spate of Asian comedy that followed over the next 10 years.\n\n===''Crazy Horse''===\nBancil's next two plays were to define him as one of the \"In Yer Face\" writers that dominated the 90s. In 1997 he wrote ''Crazy Horse''. It follows Jas, a young man trying to deal with the death of his mother by losing himself in a world of petty crime, until a tragic accident forces an estranged father and son to confront each other, but with sinister consequences. It was developed through 'Wild Lunch' with Sarah Kane and was directed by Vicky Featherstone, and received another Time Out Critics Choice. \n\n===''Made In England''===\nThe following year Bancil then wrote ''Made In England'', initially commissioned as a 15-minute piece by the Red Room. It was first performed as a full-length play in October 1998. Set against the backdrop of the music industry and \"cool Britannia\", it looked at the idea of trading your cultural identity for success. This play received Time Out Critics Choice twice.\n\n===Later work===\n''Bollywood Or Bust'' (1999) a farcical comedy, and ''Recall'' (2000), a combined dance theatre piece with Darshan Singh Bhullar, followed. The next few years saw ''Papa'' and ''Made In England'' re staged and Bancil also began to become known as a cultural commentator, writing articles for magazines and newspapers, and often contributing to radio and television debate. He also began to write and present TV documentary and venture into film and screen writing. 2007 saw another collaboration with Bhullar for ''Find Me Amongst The Black''. And from 2008\u20132009 he was on an attachment with The Soho Theatre. In 2010 he had two new stage plays, ''Dead Leaves'' and ''Rude Boy'', ready to go into production. After taking a year out to study film-making, Bancil began writing screenplays. He also became known as a cultural commentator. In 2008 he asked \"what have multicultural arts policies done for us?\" in a piece for ''The Guardian''.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married to actress [[Shivani Ghai]].

The nominal fallacy similarly referred to as the naming-explaining fallacy is an error where one believes that a label carries explanatory information in other words, the concept shrinks with knowledge.\n \nIn this comic, the function of X is either less than or equal to one. The discrete variable in this case can be divided into two parts, contradictory or exclusive categories. Therefore the dichotomous variable is discrete, i.e., nothing lies in between, its either equal to or less than.\n \nThe physician needs to understand what happens in a child\u2019s body when they are diagnosed with the green nose flue, however, he needs to understand how to treat the green nose flue and the exact meds to use. In this case, considering the opposite to contrast is more or less a means of defining something. \n \nThe defendant in the comic choses to resolve the existing discrepancy between the preexisting scenarios with the new information by settling with the fact that his fate is already decided and in spite of what he says, he is still guilty. He is accused to have the ability of reading minds by someone who doesn\u2019t share his evaluations and therefore it\u2019s hard for her to overcome the bias.  \n \nThe student has a tendency to hold on the belief that persistence is the key to success to be true in spite of the ample evidence in the calculation that discredits the belief. Upon realizing that the evidence at hand contradicts the belief he chooses to dismiss or discredit it by choosing to continue in that path until the answer turns out right. \n \nSince multiple pathways of causation imply that various antecedent conditions or causes are responsible for the same effects, in the comic above, failure to effectively manage a supply chain can more or less lead to inefficiencies.\n \nIn psychology, barnum effect occurs when an individual believes that his or her personality description specifically applies to them despite the fact that it applies to everyone else. The physician is in need of an individual with more personality, a characteristic that is applied across the board in humanity. \n \nHindsight bias in psychology is simply an explanation of the tendency of individuals to overestimate their ability to probably predict an event that was predicted prior. However, in most cases it usually happens after learning the outcome of the event.  In the comic, an event that hasn\u2019t occurred is quite hard to predict in spite the experience the fellow seems to possess. \n \nIn reality, every choice made has a consequence, both positive and negative. This is brought out in the comic as the business management team is unable to decide whether to come up with a business plan for the coming year because in the past they ended up doing nothing. However, it would be irrational lacking a plan altogether. \n \nAn experience of emotional discomfort or comfort is not a valid gauge to render something right or wrong. It\u2019s quite clear that the audience was not fascinated by the film as they anticipated but since the third individual takes comfort in the fact that the film is loved by someone else, he chooses to dismiss their opinion.\n\n==Actor==\nLevy had a starring role in the children\u2019s television series ''[[Wonderbug]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crime Fighting Heroes of Television: Over 10,000 Facts from 151 Shows, 1949-2001|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=199}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's Television 1969-1993|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=239}}</ref> for which he received an [[Emmy]] nomination<ref>The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences; 1976-1977 Emmy Awards nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children\u2019s Programming (notification: 9/11/76).</ref> in 1977.

{"title_page": "Tool steel", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{Steels}}\n\n'''Tool steel''' refers to a variety of [[carbon steel|carbon]] and [[alloy steel]]s that are particularly well-suited to be made into [[tool]]s.  Their suitability comes from their distinctive [[hardness]], resistance to [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] and deformation, and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated temperatures. As a result, tool steels are suited for use in the shaping of other materials. \nWith a carbon content between 0.5% and 1.5%, tool steels are manufactured under carefully controlled conditions to produce the required quality. The presence of [[carbide]]s in their matrix plays the dominant role in the qualities of tool steel. The four major alloying elements that form carbides in tool steel are: [[tungsten]], [[chromium]], [[vanadium]] and [[molybdenum]]. The rate of dissolution of the different carbides into the [[austenite]] form of the iron determines the high-temperature performance of steel (slower is better, making for a heat-resistant steel). Proper [[heat treatment]] of these steels is important for adequate performance.<ref name=Verhoeven>{{cite book|last1=Verhoeven|first1=John|title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=frontcover&d#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=ASM International|ISBN=978-0-87170-858-8|accessdate=9 November 2014|pages=159}}.</ref> The [[manganese]] content is often kept low to minimize the possibility of cracking during water [[quenching]].\n\nThere are six groups of tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, required surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements.<ref name=\"Marks'\">{{cite book|last=Baumeister, Avallone, Baumeister|title=Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 8th ed.|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9780070041233|chapter=6|pages=33, 34}}</ref> The more severe the service condition (higher temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, loading), the higher the alloy content and consequent amount of carbides required for the tool steel.\n\nTool steels are used for cutting, pressing, extruding, and [[Coining (metalworking)|coining]] of metals and other materials. Their use, such as the production of [[injection molding|injection molds]], is essential, due to their resistance to abrasion, which is an important criterion for a mold that will be used to produce hundreds of thousands of moldings of a product or part.\n\nThe [[American Iron and Steel Institute|AISI]]-[[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] grades of tool steel is the most common scale used to identify various grades of tool steel. Individual alloys within a grade are given a number; for example: A2, O1, etc.\n\n== Water-hardening group ==\n\nW-group tool steel gets its name from its defining property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon [[plain-carbon steel]]. This group of tool steel is the most commonly used tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for small parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above {{convert|150|C|F|abbr=on}} it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its [[hardenability]] is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above [[Rockwell scale|HRC]] 66) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels. W-steels are still sold, especially for springs, but are much less widely used than they were in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This is partly because W-steels warp and crack much more during quench than oil-quenched or air hardening steels.\n\nThe toughness of W-group tool steels is increased by alloying with manganese, silicon and molybdenum. Up to 0.20% of vanadium is used to retain fine grain sizes during heat treating.\n\nTypical applications for various carbon compositions are for W-steels:\n\n* 0.60\u20130.75% carbon: machine parts, chisels, setscrews; properties include medium hardness with good toughness and shock resistance.\n* 0.76\u20130.90% carbon: forging dies, hammers, and sledges.\n* 0.91\u20131.10% carbon: general purpose tooling applications that require a good balance of wear resistance and toughness, such as rasps, drills, cutters, and shear blades.\n* 1.11\u20131.30% carbon: files, small drills, lathe tools, razor blades, and other light-duty applications where more wear resistance is required without great toughness. Steel of about 0.8% C gets as hard as steel with more carbon, but the free iron carbide particles in 1% or 1.25% carbon steel make it hold an edge better. However, the fine edge probably rusts off faster than it wears off, if it is used to cut acidic or salty materials.\n\n== Cold-work group ==\n\nThe cold-work tool steels include the O series (oil-hardening), the A series (air-hardening), and the D series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form materials that are at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, as compared to the water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.\n\n=== Oil-hardening: the O series ===\nThis series includes an O1 type, an O2 type, an O6 type and an O7 type.  All steels in this group are typically hardened at 800&nbsp;\u00b0C, oil quenched, then tempered at <{{hsp}}200&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=98412264df644be88a7da49a179d25ad|title=Carpenter O6 Graphitic Tool Steel (AISI O6)|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=5c585a5e0a33433e824c6fc2c5f4ce89|title=Crucible Steel KETOS\u00ae Tool Steel, AISI O1|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=c76077d96f0a44e1bc961e4150700385|title=AISI Type O2 Oil-hardening Tool Steel, oil quenched at 800\u00b0C, tempered at 260\u00b0C|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=81899cda477d4d819de831f0d5686991|title=AISI Type O7 Tool Steel|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sousacorp.com/tool-steel-composition.html#oilHardening|title=The Sousa Corp {{!}} Tool Steel Composition|last=www.roberidesigns.com|website=www.sousacorp.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content is required for the necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, hardenability, and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness ([[Rockwell scale|HRC]] 58/60).  In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5\u20131% molybdenum content. In Europe, shock steels often contain {{nobr|0.5\u20130.6%}} carbon and around 3% nickel. A range of 1.75% to 2.75% nickel is still used in some shock resisting and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA), such as L6, 4340, and Swedish saw steel, but it is relatively expensive. An example of its use is in the production of [[jackhammer]] bits.\n\n== High-speed group ==\n{{main|High-speed steel}}\n\n== Hot-working group{{anchor|Hot working tool steel}} ==\n\nHot-working steels are a group of steel used to cut or shape material at high temperatures.

Their suitability comes from their distinctive [[hardness]], resistance to [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] and deformation, and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated temperatures. As a result, tool steels are suited for use in the shaping of other materials. \nWith a carbon content between 0.5% and 1.5%, tool steels are manufactured under carefully controlled conditions to produce the required quality. The presence of [[carbide]]s in their matrix plays the dominant role in the qualities of tool steel. The four major alloying elements that form carbides in tool steel are: [[tungsten]], [[chromium]], [[vanadium]] and [[molybdenum]]. The rate of dissolution of the different carbides into the [[austenite]] form of the iron determines the high-temperature performance of steel (slower is better, making for a heat-resistant steel). Proper [[heat treatment]] of these steels is important for adequate performance.<ref name=Verhoeven>{{cite book|last1=Verhoeven|first1=John|title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=frontcover&d#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=ASM International|ISBN=978-0-87170-858-8|accessdate=9 November 2014|pages=159}}.</ref> The [[manganese]] content is often kept low to minimize the possibility of cracking during water [[quenching]].\n\nThere are six groups of tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, required surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements.<ref name=\"Marks'\">{{cite book|last=Baumeister, Avallone, Baumeister|title=Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 8th ed.|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9780070041233|chapter=6|pages=33, 34}}</ref> The more severe the service condition (higher temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, loading), the higher the alloy content and consequent amount of carbides required for the tool steel.\n\nTool steels are used for cutting, pressing, extruding, and [[Coining (metalworking)|coining]] of metals and other materials. Their use, such as the production of [[injection molding|injection molds]], is essential, due to their resistance to abrasion, which is an important criterion for a mold that will be used to produce hundreds of thousands of moldings of a product or part.\n\nThe [[American Iron and Steel Institute|AISI]]-[[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] grades of tool steel is the most common scale used to identify various grades of tool steel. Individual alloys within a grade are given a number; for example: A2, O1, etc.\n\n== Water-hardening group ==\n\nW-group tool steel gets its name from its defining property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon [[plain-carbon steel]]. This group of tool steel is the most commonly used tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for small parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above {{convert|150|C|F|abbr=on}} it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its [[hardenability]] is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above [[Rockwell scale|HRC]] 66) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels. W-steels are still sold, especially for springs, but are much less widely used than they were in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This is partly because W-steels warp and crack much more during quench than oil-quenched or air hardening steels.\n\nThe toughness of W-group tool steels is increased by alloying with manganese, silicon and molybdenum. Up to 0.20% of vanadium is used to retain fine grain sizes during heat treating.\n\nTypical applications for various carbon compositions are for W-steels:\n\n* 0.60\u20130.75% carbon: machine parts, chisels, setscrews; properties include medium hardness with good toughness and shock resistance.\n* 0.76\u20130.90% carbon: forging dies, hammers, and sledges.\n* 0.91\u20131.10% carbon: general purpose tooling applications that require a good balance of wear resistance and toughness, such as rasps, drills, cutters, and shear blades.\n* 1.11\u20131.30% carbon: files, small drills, lathe tools, razor blades, and other light-duty applications where more wear resistance is required without great toughness. Steel of about 0.8% C gets as hard as steel with more carbon, but the free iron carbide particles in 1% or 1.25% carbon steel make it hold an edge better. However, the fine edge probably rusts off faster than it wears off, if it is used to cut acidic or salty materials.\n\n== Cold-work group ==\n\nThe cold-work tool steels include the O series (oil-hardening), the A series (air-hardening), and the D series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form materials that are at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, as compared to the water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.\n\n=== Oil-hardening: the O series ===\nThis series includes an O1 type, an O2 type, an O6 type and an O7 type.  All steels in this group are typically hardened at 800&nbsp;\u00b0C, oil quenched, then tempered at <{{hsp}}200&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=98412264df644be88a7da49a179d25ad|title=Carpenter O6 Graphitic Tool Steel (AISI O6)|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=5c585a5e0a33433e824c6fc2c5f4ce89|title=Crucible Steel KETOS\u00ae Tool Steel, AISI O1|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=c76077d96f0a44e1bc961e4150700385|title=AISI Type O2 Oil-hardening Tool Steel, oil quenched at 800\u00b0C, tempered at 260\u00b0C|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=81899cda477d4d819de831f0d5686991|title=AISI Type O7 Tool Steel|website=www.matweb.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sousacorp.com/tool-steel-composition.html#oilHardening|title=The Sousa Corp {{!}} Tool Steel Composition|last=www.roberidesigns.com|website=www.sousacorp.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These steels retain their hardness up to a temperature of {{convert|425|C|F|abbr=on}}. Common applications for these tool steels include forging dies, die-casting die blocks, and drawing dies. Due to their high chromium content, certain D-type tool steels are often considered [[Stainless steel|stainless]] or semi-stainless, however their corrosion resistance is very limited due to the precipitation of the majority of their chromium and carbon constituents as carbides.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The mechanical properties of D2 are very sensitive to heat treatment. It is widely used for the production of shear blades, planer blades and industrial cutting tools; sometimes used for knife blades.\n|}\n\n=== 1.2767 type ===\n\nISO 1.2767, also known as DIN X 45 NiCrMo 4, AISI 6F7, and [[British Standards|BS]] EN 20 B, is an air-hardening tool steel with a primary alloying element of nickel. It possesses good toughness, stable grains, and is highly polishable. It is primarily used for dies in plastic injection molding application that involve high stresses. Other applications include [[Blanking (metalworking)|blanking]] dies, [[forging]] dies, and industrial blades.<ref>{{Citation | title = Plastic Mould Steel / Cold Working Steel | url = http://www.buderus-steel.com/edelstahl/files/2767_ISO_B%281%29.pdf | accessdate = 2010-11-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061112103643/http://www.buderus-steel.com/edelstahl/files/2767_ISO_B(1).pdf | archive-date = 2006-11-12 | url-status = live | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\n== Shock-resisting group ==\n{{main|Shock resisting steel}}\nThe high shock resistance and good hardenability are provided by chromium-tungsten, silicon-molybdenum, silicon-manganese alloying. Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content is required for the necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, hardenability, and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness ([[Rockwell scale|HRC]] 58/60).  In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5\u20131% molybdenum content. In Europe, shock steels often contain {{nobr|0.5\u20130.6%}} carbon and around 3% nickel. A range of 1.75% to 2.75% nickel is still used in some shock resisting and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA), such as L6, 4340, and Swedish saw steel, but it is relatively expensive. An example of its use is in the production of [[jackhammer]] bits.\n\n== High-speed group ==\n{{main|High-speed steel}}\n\n== Hot-working group{{anchor|Hot working tool steel}} ==\n\nHot-working steels are a group of steel used to cut or shape material at high temperatures. H-group tool steels were developed for strength and hardness during prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. These tool steels are low carbon and moderate to high alloy that provide good hot hardness and toughness and fair wear resistance due to a substantial amount of carbide.<ref name=\"Verhoeven\" /> H1 to H19 are based on a chromium content of 5%; H20 to H39 are based on a tungsten content of 9-18% and a chromium content of 3\u20134%; H40 to H59 are molybdenum based.\n\nExamples include [[DIN 1.2344 tool steel]] (H13).\n\n== Special-purpose group ==\n\n* {{visible anchor|P-type tool steel}} is short for plastic mold steels. They are designed to meet the requirements of zinc [[die casting]] and plastic injection molding dies.\n* [[Low-alloy special purpose steel|L-type]] tool steel is short for low alloy special purpose tool steel. L6 is extremely tough.\n* F-type tool steel is water hardened and substantially more wear resistant than W-type tool steel.\n\n==  Comparison  ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ AISI-SAE tool steel grades<ref>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|McCauley|Heald|2004|p=452}}.</ref>\n|-\n!

The song was originally released as a limited edition \"Club Mix\" in December 1990 with [[Pete Wylie]] on vocals. A re-recorded version with [[Bill Drummond]] on vocals was released commercially in October 1991. These recordings were the first releases by Drummond and his creative partner [[Jimmy Cauty]] under the JAMs moniker since the 1988 compilation album ''[[Shag Times]]'', and the last under that name; in the meantime they had operated as [[The Timelords (band)|the Timelords]] and [[the KLF]]. The 1991 single release reached No. 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nThe lyrics to \"It's Grim Up North\" list towns and cities in the [[Northern England|North of England]], set to a pounding [[industrial techno]] beat and percussion reminiscent of [[steam whistle]]s. The 1991 version segues into an orchestral instrumental of the hymn \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\". A recurring theme of \"It's Grim Up North\" was drab greyness, representing the dreary, overcast skies of the \"grim\" North. The original single featuring Pete Wylie was pressed on grey vinyl, and the same colour was retained for the sleeve of the 1991 release. The video for \"It's Grim Up North\" was filmed in black and white, and shows The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu performing in the pouring rain.\n\n\"It's Grim Up North\" was planned to be a prominent track on the JAM's album ''[[The Black Room (KLF album)|The Black Room]]'', but the album was never completed.\n\n==Background==\nMusic-industry figure [[Bill Drummond]] and artist/musician [[Jimmy Cauty]] began recording together in 1987 as [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (also known as The JAMs), naming themselves after the fictional conspiratorial group \"The Justified Ancients of Mummu\" from ''[[The Illuminatus!

The seven-minute first section is a heavy, pounding [[industrial techno]] track, over which Drummond lists the names of some towns and cities in the [[North of England]]. Between verses, Drummond's distorted voice urgently alerts us that \"It's grim up north\". The instrumentation is in a [[minor key]] and is frequently [[dissonance (music)|discord]]ant, featuring synthesised sounds reminiscent of passing [[heavy goods vehicle]]s and train whistles. Although the underlying rhythm keeps a 4/4 [[time signature]], several instruments keep 3/16 and 3/4 time throughout the track, including a deep second drum line\u2014the \"regular dull thud\"\u2014which juxtaposes when the 4/4 instruments and percussion drop out. The second section is a fully orchestrated [[arrangement]] of ''Jerusalem'', with the sounds of brass, strings, organs, drums and choir. The instrumentation and vocals of the first section gradually diminish to nothing over a period of nearly two minutes.

The 1991 single release reached No. 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nThe lyrics to \"It's Grim Up North\" list towns and cities in the [[Northern England|North of England]], set to a pounding [[industrial techno]] beat and percussion reminiscent of [[steam whistle]]s. The 1991 version segues into an orchestral instrumental of the hymn \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\". A recurring theme of \"It's Grim Up North\" was drab greyness, representing the dreary, overcast skies of the \"grim\" North. The original single featuring Pete Wylie was pressed on grey vinyl, and the same colour was retained for the sleeve of the 1991 release. The video for \"It's Grim Up North\" was filmed in black and white, and shows The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu performing in the pouring rain.\n\n\"It's Grim Up North\" was planned to be a prominent track on the JAM's album ''[[The Black Room (KLF album)|The Black Room]]'', but the album was never completed.\n\n==Background==\nMusic-industry figure [[Bill Drummond]] and artist/musician [[Jimmy Cauty]] began recording together in 1987 as [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (also known as The JAMs), naming themselves after the fictional conspiratorial group \"The Justified Ancients of Mummu\" from ''[[The Illuminatus!

The seven-minute first section is a heavy, pounding [[industrial techno]] track, over which Drummond lists the names of some towns and cities in the [[North of England]]. Between verses, Drummond's distorted voice urgently alerts us that \"It's grim up north\". The instrumentation is in a [[minor key]] and is frequently [[dissonance (music)|discord]]ant, featuring synthesised sounds reminiscent of passing [[heavy goods vehicle]]s and train whistles. Although the underlying rhythm keeps a 4/4 [[time signature]], several instruments keep 3/16 and 3/4 time throughout the track, including a deep second drum line\u2014the \"regular dull thud\"\u2014which juxtaposes when the 4/4 instruments and percussion drop out. The second section is a fully orchestrated [[arrangement]] of ''Jerusalem'', with the sounds of brass, strings, organs, drums and choir. The instrumentation and vocals of the first section gradually diminish to nothing over a period of nearly two minutes.

Ju Sang-song was confirmed its minister, although he was now under NDC Vice-Chairman [[Chang Sung-taek]].

Its name was changed to '''''The Ted Knight Show''''' when the show was retooled for what would turn out to be its final season.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ted Knight]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] star as Henry and Muriel Rush, respectively; owners of a two-family house in [[San Francisco, California]]. Henry is a conservative cartoonist who authors a comic strip called ''Cosmic Cow.'' During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of \"Cosmic Cow.\" Muriel is a laid back freelance photographer, having been a lead singer of a band in her earlier days. They have two grown children, older daughter, brunette Jackie ([[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]]) who works for a bank and younger daughter Sara ([[Lydia Cornell]]), a blonde bombshell and a college student at [[San Francisco State University]].\n\nAt the start of the premiere episode, Jackie and Sara are living with their parents in a cramped, awkward arrangement. Their longtime downstairs tenant, Myron (later called Neville) Rafkin, recently died. The family discovers Rafkin was a [[transvestism|transvestite]] and the many strange women Henry had been opening the door for all those years were actually Rafkin himself. Jackie and Sara convince their parents to allow them to move into the now-vacant downstairs apartment. In a running gag, Henry falls off the girls' ultra-modern chairs or couch every time he attempts to sit down. Despite the daughters' push for independence and moving into the downstairs apartment, Henry proves to be a very protective father and constantly meddles in their affairs.\n\nDue to an actors' strike led by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], new programming for the fall 1980 season was pushed back several months. As a result, ''Too Close for Comfort'' did not debut until November 11, 1980, and its initial season consisted of 19 episodes. The show garnered high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], benefiting from its placement in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] powerhouse Tuesday night lineup following hits like ''[[Happy Days]],'' ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]].''  Both the latter series and this series were recorded in the same studio, [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]], during ''Too Close for Comfort'''s ABC years.\n\nA few episodes into the series, Sara's addle-headed friend Monroe Ficus, played by actor [[Jim J. Bullock]], made an appearance. Although he was originally intended to be used for only a single episode, producers added the character to the series.  Monroe was introduced to Henry by Sara as a depressed, lonely fellow student and street musician.  Although Sara (with help from Jackie) tried to help him and send him on his way, Monroe found himself getting woven into the entire family's affairs and he became just a \"friend\" of Sara's and Henry's principal (if unintended) foil. During the first two seasons, [[Selma Diamond]] made guest appearances as Mildred Rafkin, sister of the late Myron. Sardonic, deadpan Mildred initially showed up to collect belongings left by Myron/Neville in the downstairs apartment, but continued to visit thereafter. Seemingly, there were sentimental reasons, but occasionally she would attempt to make time with the much younger Monroe, with whom she was infatuated.\n\nAlso added in early 1981 was Arthur Wainwright ([[Hamilton Camp]]), Henry's boss and head of Wainwright Publishing, who nearly decided to force the veteran cartoonist and ''Cosmic Cow'' into retirement in order to maintain a youth-oriented staff. The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with [[Shakespearean]] diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, at the start of the fifth season, [[Graham Jarvis]] began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.\n\n===Developments in seasons two and three===\n[[Image:Too Close for Comfort.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The cast of ''Too Close for Comfort'' during the show's second season]]\nDuring its second season, the series' principal stories are focused around Muriel's pregnancy. Additionally, Henry's niece April ([[Deena Freeman]]) comes from [[Delaware]] to live with the Rush family. The season concludes with Muriel giving birth to a son, Andrew (later played regularly by twins William and Michael Cannon from 1983 to 1984).\n\nFor the third season, April departs and the character of Muriel's mother, Iris Martin ([[Audrey Meadows]]) is added in order to help take care of Andrew. Also that fall, Jackie becomes engaged to her steady boyfriend, police officer Brad Turner (played by [[Gary Dontzig]] in one episode and by Jordan Suffin thereafter), but they broke it off after a short time. Jackie eventually moved into the field of fashion design, taking courses and producing her own clothing templates, which she later had produced as \"The Jacqueline Rush Collection.\" Sara, meanwhile, decided to major in communications and, while continuing her studies, became a weather girl for a time at a major San Francisco TV station. Monroe seemed to be detached from Sara's circle of friends, but was taking the same major as her and became a security guard around campus.\n\nThe character of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities. It was revealed in one episode that he wore the different sweatshirts because he himself had never gone to college. Eventually fans would send in sweatshirts from universities around the country hoping they would be used during taping.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ABC moved the series to Thursday nights, which proved to be disastrous. Paired with failures such as ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]],'' ''[[Star of the Family]]'' and ''[[It Takes Two (1982 TV series)|It Takes Two]],'' ''Too Close For Comfort'' saw its ratings fall drastically. At the conclusion of the season, the network cancelled the series, after dropping from #6 the previous season to #38. ABC broadcast the last first-run episode broadcast on May 5, 1983, as a pilot for a proposed [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''Family Business''. The series was to have focused on the misadventures of Lucille Garabaldi ([[Lainie Kazan]]) and her two sons (played by [[George Deloy]] and [[Jimmy Baio]]) as they tried to run a construction business. [[Hillary Bailey Smith]] was also featured in this backdoor pilot as the new, attractive female foreman that Lucille hired for her sons.\n\nABC aired reruns of ''Too Close for Comfort'' at 11:00 am ET from June 27 to September 23, 1983.\n\n===First-run syndication===\nDuring the early 1980s, TV station owner [[Metromedia]] was expanding its portfolio of original [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming through its production subsidiary, Metromedia Producers Corporation. Its efforts would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. When ''Too Close for Comfort'' was canceled by ABC, Metromedia Producers Corporation elected to pick up the series and began producing all-new episodes to run on various stations throughout the country.\n\nStarting in April 1984, a total of 23 new episodes were broadcast for the show's fourth season, featuring the same cast as seen on the ABC episodes. Monroe and Iris were still around to bother Henry (although Meadows had cut back her involvement to guest shots only, so her character moves back to Chicago in the season premiere) and Jackie and Sara were still downstairs. The girls continued to advance in the respective career paths; Sara auditioned for a news anchor position at the TV station, but was passed over in favor of a female candidate who may have not had Sara's looks, but had greater experience in hard news. This caused Sara to learn the valuable lesson that her sex appeal alone would not get her everywhere. Monroe eventually moves into a remodeled attic, with the entrance from the Rushes' kitchen. Henry agreed to have Monroe as a tenant in a fleeting moment of compassion, but Monroe still proved to be a constant annoyance to him.\n\nThe show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] improved in syndication and Metromedia ordered an additional 30 episodes, airing through November 1985. When the fifth season began, a single child actor, Joshua Goodwin, took over the role of Andrew Rush (which he would hold for the remainder of the series). Henry was now working out of his own fancy office at Wainwright Publishing, as a result of toddler Andrew's \"[[Child development stage|terrible twos]]\" behavior interfering with his concentration at home. Everyone else's worldly or, in the case of Monroe, wacky affairs were also proving to be an intense distraction, considering they were all living under the same roof. Near the end of the season, Jackie accepted a job offer in Italy that would help further her clothing line, with her family and friends giving her a big send-off. With a total of 107 episodes of ''Too Close for Comfort'' having been produced, the show became a popular staple for syndicated reruns throughout the late 1980s.\n\n====''The Ted Knight Show''====\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_original.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for first run episodes. Note the title change.]]\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_retitle.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for reruns.]]\nIn late 1985, several changes were made before further episodes were produced. The show's title was changed to ''The Ted Knight Show'' (not to be confused with the short-lived 1978 [[CBS]] [[The Ted Knight Show (1978 TV series)|show of the same name]]; hence it was occasionally referred to as ''The New Ted Knight Show'', such as when Jim J. Bullock made a guest appearance on ''[[Break the Bank (1985 game show)|Break the Bank]]'') and the setting was changed to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], north of San Francisco. A new arrangement of Johnny Mandel's theme song was recorded, and a new opening title sequence was shot in the surrounding area. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Lydia Cornell, and Audrey Meadows left the cast (Meadows would make one guest appearance this season). Veteran actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], as well as Lisa Antille were added to the cast along with returning Nancy Dussault, and Jim J. Bullock.\n\nThe Rushes had moved to a larger house near [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]]. Henry retired from cartooning and became editor of the ''Marin Bugler'', a local newspaper. Henry purchased a 49% stake in the publication from Hope Stinson (Carroll), who retained the other 51% and proved to be a thorn in his side. Muriel began working as the paper's staff photographer. Monroe, now living in his own apartment, visited frequently, and worked as a reporter-in-training at the ''Bugler''. The Rushes hired a live-in nanny/housekeeper, a young woman named Lisa Flores (Antille), who would later become involved with Monroe. Antille had made a guest appearance in a fifth season ''Too Close for Comfort'' episode as Yvonne, a housekeeper the Rushes employed until she attempted to marry Monroe to avoid deportation.\n\nFirst-run episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were broadcast starting in April 1986. Twenty-two episodes were produced prior to the summer of 1986 and twelve had aired by mid-July. The revamped show continued to be successful and was scheduled to resume production for another season but Ted Knight, who had been battling [[colon cancer]] since 1985, died on August 26, 1986 at the age of 62 and no further episodes would be produced. The ten remaining first-run episodes were broadcast from September 1986 to February 1987.\n\nWhen the episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were added to the rerun package of ''Too Close for Comfort'', the original show's title graphic was used, but the updated opening theme and sequence remained unchanged.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643852899598/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643856232931/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Henry Rush\n* [[Nancy Dussault]] as Muriel Rush\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Jackie Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Lydia Cornell]] as Sara Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Jim J.

Its name was changed to '''''The Ted Knight Show''''' when the show was retooled for what would turn out to be its final season.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ted Knight]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] star as Henry and Muriel Rush, respectively; owners of a two-family house in [[San Francisco, California]]. Henry is a conservative cartoonist who authors a comic strip called ''Cosmic Cow.'' During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of \"Cosmic Cow.\" Muriel is a laid back freelance photographer, having been a lead singer of a band in her earlier days. They have two grown children, older daughter, brunette Jackie ([[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]]) who works for a bank and younger daughter Sara ([[Lydia Cornell]]), a blonde bombshell and a college student at [[San Francisco State University]].\n\nAt the start of the premiere episode, Jackie and Sara are living with their parents in a cramped, awkward arrangement. Their longtime downstairs tenant, Myron (later called Neville) Rafkin, recently died. The family discovers Rafkin was a [[transvestism|transvestite]] and the many strange women Henry had been opening the door for all those years were actually Rafkin himself. Jackie and Sara convince their parents to allow them to move into the now-vacant downstairs apartment. In a running gag, Henry falls off the girls' ultra-modern chairs or couch every time he attempts to sit down. Despite the daughters' push for independence and moving into the downstairs apartment, Henry proves to be a very protective father and constantly meddles in their affairs.\n\nDue to an actors' strike led by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], new programming for the fall 1980 season was pushed back several months. As a result, ''Too Close for Comfort'' did not debut until November 11, 1980, and its initial season consisted of 19 episodes. The show garnered high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], benefiting from its placement in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] powerhouse Tuesday night lineup following hits like ''[[Happy Days]],'' ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]].''  Both the latter series and this series were recorded in the same studio, [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]], during ''Too Close for Comfort'''s ABC years.\n\nA few episodes into the series, Sara's addle-headed friend Monroe Ficus, played by actor [[Jim J. Bullock]], made an appearance. Although he was originally intended to be used for only a single episode, producers added the character to the series.  Monroe was introduced to Henry by Sara as a depressed, lonely fellow student and street musician.  Although Sara (with help from Jackie) tried to help him and send him on his way, Monroe found himself getting woven into the entire family's affairs and he became just a \"friend\" of Sara's and Henry's principal (if unintended) foil. During the first two seasons, [[Selma Diamond]] made guest appearances as Mildred Rafkin, sister of the late Myron. Sardonic, deadpan Mildred initially showed up to collect belongings left by Myron/Neville in the downstairs apartment, but continued to visit thereafter. Seemingly, there were sentimental reasons, but occasionally she would attempt to make time with the much younger Monroe, with whom she was infatuated.\n\nAlso added in early 1981 was Arthur Wainwright ([[Hamilton Camp]]), Henry's boss and head of Wainwright Publishing, who nearly decided to force the veteran cartoonist and ''Cosmic Cow'' into retirement in order to maintain a youth-oriented staff. The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with [[Shakespearean]] diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, at the start of the fifth season, [[Graham Jarvis]] began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.\n\n===Developments in seasons two and three===\n[[Image:Too Close for Comfort.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The cast of ''Too Close for Comfort'' during the show's second season]]\nDuring its second season, the series' principal stories are focused around Muriel's pregnancy. Additionally, Henry's niece April ([[Deena Freeman]]) comes from [[Delaware]] to live with the Rush family. The season concludes with Muriel giving birth to a son, Andrew (later played regularly by twins William and Michael Cannon from 1983 to 1984).\n\nFor the third season, April departs and the character of Muriel's mother, Iris Martin ([[Audrey Meadows]]) is added in order to help take care of Andrew. Also that fall, Jackie becomes engaged to her steady boyfriend, police officer Brad Turner (played by [[Gary Dontzig]] in one episode and by Jordan Suffin thereafter), but they broke it off after a short time. Jackie eventually moved into the field of fashion design, taking courses and producing her own clothing templates, which she later had produced as \"The Jacqueline Rush Collection.\" Sara, meanwhile, decided to major in communications and, while continuing her studies, became a weather girl for a time at a major San Francisco TV station. Monroe seemed to be detached from Sara's circle of friends, but was taking the same major as her and became a security guard around campus.\n\nThe character of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities. It was revealed in one episode that he wore the different sweatshirts because he himself had never gone to college. Eventually fans would send in sweatshirts from universities around the country hoping they would be used during taping.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ABC moved the series to Thursday nights, which proved to be disastrous. Paired with failures such as ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]],'' ''[[Star of the Family]]'' and ''[[It Takes Two (1982 TV series)|It Takes Two]],'' ''Too Close For Comfort'' saw its ratings fall drastically. At the conclusion of the season, the network cancelled the series, after dropping from #6 the previous season to #38. ABC broadcast the last first-run episode broadcast on May 5, 1983, as a pilot for a proposed [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''Family Business''. The series was to have focused on the misadventures of Lucille Garabaldi ([[Lainie Kazan]]) and her two sons (played by [[George Deloy]] and [[Jimmy Baio]]) as they tried to run a construction business. [[Hillary Bailey Smith]] was also featured in this backdoor pilot as the new, attractive female foreman that Lucille hired for her sons.\n\nABC aired reruns of ''Too Close for Comfort'' at 11:00 am ET from June 27 to September 23, 1983.\n\n===First-run syndication===\nDuring the early 1980s, TV station owner [[Metromedia]] was expanding its portfolio of original [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming through its production subsidiary, Metromedia Producers Corporation. Its efforts would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. When ''Too Close for Comfort'' was canceled by ABC, Metromedia Producers Corporation elected to pick up the series and began producing all-new episodes to run on various stations throughout the country.\n\nStarting in April 1984, a total of 23 new episodes were broadcast for the show's fourth season, featuring the same cast as seen on the ABC episodes. Monroe and Iris were still around to bother Henry (although Meadows had cut back her involvement to guest shots only, so her character moves back to Chicago in the season premiere) and Jackie and Sara were still downstairs. The girls continued to advance in the respective career paths; Sara auditioned for a news anchor position at the TV station, but was passed over in favor of a female candidate who may have not had Sara's looks, but had greater experience in hard news. This caused Sara to learn the valuable lesson that her sex appeal alone would not get her everywhere. Monroe eventually moves into a remodeled attic, with the entrance from the Rushes' kitchen. Henry agreed to have Monroe as a tenant in a fleeting moment of compassion, but Monroe still proved to be a constant annoyance to him.\n\nThe show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] improved in syndication and Metromedia ordered an additional 30 episodes, airing through November 1985. When the fifth season began, a single child actor, Joshua Goodwin, took over the role of Andrew Rush (which he would hold for the remainder of the series). Henry was now working out of his own fancy office at Wainwright Publishing, as a result of toddler Andrew's \"[[Child development stage|terrible twos]]\" behavior interfering with his concentration at home. Everyone else's worldly or, in the case of Monroe, wacky affairs were also proving to be an intense distraction, considering they were all living under the same roof. Near the end of the season, Jackie accepted a job offer in Italy that would help further her clothing line, with her family and friends giving her a big send-off. With a total of 107 episodes of ''Too Close for Comfort'' having been produced, the show became a popular staple for syndicated reruns throughout the late 1980s.\n\n====''The Ted Knight Show''====\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_original.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for first run episodes. Note the title change.]]\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_retitle.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for reruns.]]\nIn late 1985, several changes were made before further episodes were produced. The show's title was changed to ''The Ted Knight Show'' (not to be confused with the short-lived 1978 [[CBS]] [[The Ted Knight Show (1978 TV series)|show of the same name]]; hence it was occasionally referred to as ''The New Ted Knight Show'', such as when Jim J. Bullock made a guest appearance on ''[[Break the Bank (1985 game show)|Break the Bank]]'') and the setting was changed to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], north of San Francisco. A new arrangement of Johnny Mandel's theme song was recorded, and a new opening title sequence was shot in the surrounding area. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Lydia Cornell, and Audrey Meadows left the cast (Meadows would make one guest appearance this season). Veteran actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], as well as Lisa Antille were added to the cast along with returning Nancy Dussault, and Jim J. Bullock.\n\nThe Rushes had moved to a larger house near [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]]. Henry retired from cartooning and became editor of the ''Marin Bugler'', a local newspaper. Henry purchased a 49% stake in the publication from Hope Stinson (Carroll), who retained the other 51% and proved to be a thorn in his side. Muriel began working as the paper's staff photographer. Monroe, now living in his own apartment, visited frequently, and worked as a reporter-in-training at the ''Bugler''. The Rushes hired a live-in nanny/housekeeper, a young woman named Lisa Flores (Antille), who would later become involved with Monroe. Antille had made a guest appearance in a fifth season ''Too Close for Comfort'' episode as Yvonne, a housekeeper the Rushes employed until she attempted to marry Monroe to avoid deportation.\n\nFirst-run episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were broadcast starting in April 1986. Twenty-two episodes were produced prior to the summer of 1986 and twelve had aired by mid-July. The revamped show continued to be successful and was scheduled to resume production for another season but Ted Knight, who had been battling [[colon cancer]] since 1985, died on August 26, 1986 at the age of 62 and no further episodes would be produced. The ten remaining first-run episodes were broadcast from September 1986 to February 1987.\n\nWhen the episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were added to the rerun package of ''Too Close for Comfort'', the original show's title graphic was used, but the updated opening theme and sequence remained unchanged.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643852899598/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643856232931/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Henry Rush\n* [[Nancy Dussault]] as Muriel Rush\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Jackie Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Lydia Cornell]] as Sara Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Jm J.

The equator is one of the five notable [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] on Earth; the other four are both [[polar circle]]s (the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]]) and both [[tropics|tropical circles]] (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). The equator is the only line of latitude which is also a [[great circle]]\u2014that is, one whose [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] passes through the center of the globe. The plane of Earth's equator, when projected outwards to the [[celestial sphere]], defines the [[celestial equator]].\n\nIn the cycle of Earth's [[season]]s, the equatorial plane runs through the Sun twice per [[year]]: on the [[equinox]]es in [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox|September]]. To a person on Earth, the Sun [[subsolar point|appears to travel above]] the equator (or along the celestial equator) at these times. Light rays from the Sun's center are [[perpendicular]] to Earth's surface at the point of [[Noon#Solar noon|solar noon]] on the equator.\n\n[[File:Equator Sao Tome.jpg|thumb|left|The equator marked as it crosses [[Ilh\u00e9u das Rolas]], in [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]]]\n[[File:equator Line Monument, Macap\u00e1 city, Brazil.jpg|left|thumb|The Marco Zero monument marking the equator in [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nLocations on the equator experience the shortest [[sunrise]]s and [[sunset]]s because the Sun's [[sun path|daily path]] is nearly perpendicular to the [[horizon]] for most of the year. The length of [[daylight]] (sunrise to sunset) is almost constant throughout the year; it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to [[atmospheric refraction]] and the fact that sunrise begins (or sunset ends) as the upper limb, not the center, of the Sun's disk contacts the horizon.\n\nEarth [[equatorial bulge|bulges slightly]] at the equator; the \"average\" diameter of Earth is {{cvt|12750|km|mi}}, but the diameter at the equator is about {{cvt|43|km|mi}} greater than at the poles.<ref name=\"National\">{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/equator/?ar_a=1|title=Equator|author= |date= |work= |website=National Geographic - Education|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSites near the equator, such as the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], are good locations for [[spaceport]]s as they have a fastest [[rotational speed]] of any latitude, 460&nbsp;m/s.

A launching due east from a site on the equator could take advantage of the earth's maximum rotational velocity (460 meters per second) to achieve orbital speed. The more frequent overhead passage of the orbiting vehicle above an equatorial base would facilitate tracking and communications. Most important, an equatorial launch site would avoid the costly dogleg technique, a prerequisite for placing rockets into equatorial orbit from sites such as Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 degrees north latitude). The necessary correction in the space vehicle's trajectory could be very expensive - engineers estimated that doglegging a Saturn vehicle into a low-altitude equatorial orbit from Cape Canaveral used enough extra propellant to reduce the payload by as much as 80%. In higher orbits, the penalty was less severe but still involved at least a 20% loss of payload. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Geodesy ==\n{{further|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}\n\n===Precise location===\nThe precise location of the equator is not truly fixed; the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the [[Axial tilt|Earth's spin axis]], which [[polar motion|drifts]] about {{convert|9|m|0}} during a year.

If it were really circular, the length of the equator would then be exactly 2\u03c0 times the radius, namely 40,075.0142 kilometres (24,901.4594&nbsp;mi). The [[GRS 80]] (Geodetic Reference System 1980) as approved and adopted by the IUGG at its Canberra, Australia meeting of 1979 has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). The [[WGS 84]] (World Geodetic System 1984) which is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], also has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). For both GRS 80 and WGS 84, this results in a length for the equator of 40,075.0167&nbsp;km (24,901.4609&nbsp;mi).\n\nThe [[geographical mile]] is defined as one [[arc-minute]] of the equator, so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed. For example, by WSG-84, the distance is {{convert|1855.3248|m}}, while by IAU-2000, it is {{convert|1855.3257|m}}. This is a difference of less than {{Convert|1|mm||spell=in}} over the total distance (approximately {{convert|1.86|km||disp=or}}).\n\nThe earth is commonly modeled as a [[sphere]] flattened 0.336% along its axis.

Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth]]'s rotation on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark, and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\nSeasons result from the tilt of the Earth's axis compared to the plane of its revolution around the Sun. Throughout the year the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately turned either toward or away from the sun depending on Earth's position in its orbit. The hemisphere turned toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer, while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see [[solstice]]).\n\nAt the [[equinoxes]], the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun rather than tilted toward or away, meaning that day and night are both about 12 hours long across the whole of the Earth.\n\nNear the equator, this means the variation in strength of solar radiation is different relative to the time of year than it is at higher latitudes: Maximum solar radiation is received during the equinoxes, when a place at the equator is under the [[subsolar point]] at high noon, and the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn occur at higher latitudes, and the minimum occurs during ''both'' solstices, when either pole is tilted towards or away from the sun, resulting in either summer or winter in both hemispheres. This also results in a corresponding movement of the equator away from the subsolar point, which is then situated over or near the relevant [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]] [[Tropic of Capricorn|circle]]. Nevertheless, temperatures are high year round due to the earth's [[axial tilt]] of 23.5\u00b0 not being enough to create a low minimum midday [[Position of the Sun|declination]] to sufficiently weaken the sun's rays even during the solstices.\n\nNear the equator there is little temperature change throughout the year, though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity. The terms summer, autumn, winter and spring do not generally apply. Lowlands around the equator generally have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], also known as an equatorial climate, though cold ocean currents cause some regions to have [[tropical monsoon climate]]s with a [[dry season]] in the middle of the year, and the [[Somali Current]] generated by [[Monsoon of South Asia|the Asian monsoon]] due to continental heating via the high [[Tibetan Plateau]] causes [[Greater Somalia]] to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location.\n\nAverage annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around {{convert|31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the afternoon and {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} around sunrise. Rainfall is very high away from cold ocean current upwelling zones, from {{convert|2500|to|3500|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} per year. There are about 200 rainy days per year and average annual sunshine hours are around 2,000. Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the [[Andes]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have glaciers. The highest point on the equator is at the elevation of {{convert|4690|m|0}}, at {{coord|0|0|0|N|77|59|31|W|type:landmark_region:EC|name=highest point on the equator}}, found on the southern slopes of [[Volc\u00e1n Cayambe]] [summit {{convert|5790|m|0}}] in [[Ecuador]]. This is slightly above the [[snow line]] and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground. At the equator the snow line is around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} ''lower'' than on [[Mount Everest]] and as much as {{convert|2000|m|ft}} lower than the highest snow line in the world, near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on [[Llullaillaco]].\n<div style=\"width:85%;\">\n{{Weather box|location = [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]] in South America\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C =

[[Indonesia]] is the country straddling the greatest length of the equatorial line across both land and sea.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is derived from medieval Latin word ''aequator'', in the phrase ''circulus aequator diei et noctis,'' meaning 'circle equalizing day and night', from the Latin word ''aequare'' meaning 'make equal'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/equator|title=Definition of equator|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Equator monument.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Equator sign kenya.jpg\n| width2 = 125\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Left'': A monument marking the equator near the city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia]]<br />''Right'': Road sign marking the equator near [[Nanyuki]], [[Kenya]]\n}}\n\nThe [[latitude]] of the Earth's equator is, by definition, 0\u00b0 (zero [[degree (angle)|degrees]]) of arc. The equator is one of the five notable [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] on Earth; the other four are both [[polar circle]]s (the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]]) and both [[tropics|tropical circles]] (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). The equator is the only line of latitude which is also a [[great circle]]\u2014that is, one whose [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] passes through the center of the globe. The plane of Earth's equator, when projected outwards to the [[celestial sphere]], defines the [[celestial equator]].\n\nIn the cycle of Earth's [[season]]s, the equatorial plane runs through the Sun twice per [[year]]: on the [[equinox]]es in [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox|September]]. To a person on Earth, the Sun [[subsolar point|appears to travel above]] the equator (or along the celestial equator) at these times. Light rays from the Sun's center are [[perpendicular]] to Earth's surface at the point of [[Noon#Solar noon|solar noon]] on the equator.\n\n[[File:Equator Sao Tome.jpg|thumb|left|The equator marked as it crosses [[Ilh\u00e9u das Rolas]], in [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]]]\n[[File:equator Line Monument, Macap\u00e1 city, Brazil.jpg|left|thumb|The Marco Zero monument marking the equator in [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nLocations on the equator experience the shortest [[sunrise]]s and [[sunset]]s because the Sun's [[sun path|daily path]] is nearly perpendicular to the [[horizon]] for most of the year. The length of [[daylight]] (sunrise to sunset) is almost constant throughout the year; it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to [[atmospheric refraction]] and the fact that sunrise begins (or sunset ends) as the upper limb, not the center, of the Sun's disk contacts the horizon.\n\nEarth [[equatorial bulge|bulges slightly]] at the equator; the \"average\" diameter of Earth is {{cvt|12750|km|mi}}, but the diameter at the equator is about {{cvt|43|km|mi}} greater than at the poles.<ref name=\"National\">{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/equator/?ar_a=1|title=Equator|author= |date= |work= |website=National Geographic - Education|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSites near the equator, such as the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], are good locations for [[spaceport]]s as they have a fastest [[rotational speed]] of any latitude, 460&nbsp;m/s.

A launching due east from a site on the equator could take advantage of the earth's maximum rotational velocity (460 meters per second) to achieve orbital speed. The more frequent overhead passage of the orbiting vehicle above an equatorial base would facilitate tracking and communications. Most important, an equatorial launch site would avoid the costly dogleg technique, a prerequisite for placing rockets into equatorial orbit from sites such as Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 degrees north latitude). The necessary correction in the space vehicle's trajectory could be very expensive - engineers estimated that doglegging a Saturn vehicle into a low-altitude equatorial orbit from Cape Canaveral used enough extra propellant to reduce the payload by as much as 80%. In higher orbits, the penalty was less severe but still involved at least a 20% loss of payload. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Geodesy ==\n{{further|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}\n\n===Precise location===\nThe precise location of the equator is not truly fixed; the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the [[Axial tilt|Earth's spin axis]], which [[polar motion|drifts]] about {{convert|9|m|0}} during a year.

If it were really circular, the length of the equator would then be exactly 2\u03c0 times the radius, namely 40,075.0142 kilometres (24,901.4594&nbsp;mi). The [[GRS 80]] (Geodetic Reference System 1980) as approved and adopted by the IUGG at its Canberra, Australia meeting of 1979 has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). The [[WGS 84]] (World Geodetic System 1984) which is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], also has an equatorial radius of 6,378.137 kilometres (3,963.191&nbsp;mi). For both GRS 80 and WGS 84, this results in a length for the equator of 40,075.0167&nbsp;km (24,901.4609&nbsp;mi).\n\nThe [[geographical mile]] is defined as one [[arc-minute]] of the equator, so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed. For example, by WSG-84, the distance is {{convert|1855.3248|m}}, while by IAU-2000, it is {{convert|1855.3257|m}}. This is a difference of less than {{Convert|1|mm||spell=in}} over the total distance (approximately {{convert|1.86|km||disp=or}}).\n\nThe earth is commonly modeled as a [[sphere]] flattened 0.336% along its axis. This makes the equator 0.16% longer than a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (a great circle passing through the two poles). The IUGG standard meridian is, to the nearest millimetre, {{convert|40007.862917|km}}, one arc-minute of which is {{convert|1852.216|m}}, explaining the [[International System of Units|SI]] standardization of the [[nautical mile]] as {{convert|1852|m}}, more than {{convert|3|m}} less than the [[geographical mile]].\n\nThe [[Sea level|sea-level]] surface of the Earth (the [[geoid]]) is irregular, so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine. ''[[Aviation week and space technology|Aviation Week and Space Technology]]'' on 9 October 1961 reported that measurements using the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] IV-A satellite had shown the equatorial diameter from longitude 11\u00b0 West to 169\u00b0 East to be {{convert|1000|ft}} greater than its diameter ninety degrees away.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Equatorial countries and territories ==\n{{kml}}\n[[File:ECSundialGPS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Global Positioning System|GPS]] reading taken on the equator close to the [[Quitsato Sundial]], at [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo|Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ecuador]]<ref name=\"Informe que determina la posici\u00f3n de la L\u00ednea Ecuatorial\">{{cite web|author=Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Militar de Ecuador|title=Memoria T\u00e9cnica de la Determinaci\u00f3n de la Latitud Cero|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/97475201/Documento-Posicionamiento-Reloj-Solar|date=24 January 2005|language=Spanish}}</ref>]]\nThe equator passes through the land of 11 [[country|countries]].

Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth]]'s rotation on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark, and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\nSeasons result from the tilt of the Earth's axis compared to the plane of its revolution around the Sun. Throughout the year the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately turned either toward or away from the sun depending on Earth's position in its orbit. The hemisphere turned toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer, while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see [[solstice]]).\n\nAt the [[equinoxes]], the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun rather than tilted toward or away, meaning that day and night are both about 12 hours long across the whole of the Earth.\n\nNear the equator, this means the variation in strength of solar radiation is different relative to the time of year than it is at higher latitudes: Maximum solar radiation is received during the equinoxes, when a place at the equator is under the [[subsolar point]] at high noon, and the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn occur at higher latitudes, and the minimum occurs during ''both'' solstices, when either pole is tilted towards or away from the sun, resulting in either summer or winter in both hemispheres. This also results in a corresponding movement of the equator away from the subsolar point, which is then situated over or near the relevant [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]] [[Tropic of Capricorn|circle]]. Nevertheless, temperatures are high year round due to the earth's [[axial tilt]] of 23.5\u00b0 not being enough to create a low minimum midday [[Position of the Sun|declination]] to sufficiently weaken the sun's rays even during the solstices.\n\nNear the equator there is little temperature change throughout the year, though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity. The terms summer, autumn, winter and spring do not generally apply. Lowlands around the equator generally have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], also known as an equatorial climate, though cold ocean currents cause some regions to have [[tropical monsoon climate]]s with a [[dry season]] in the middle of the year, and the [[Somali Current]] generated by [[Monsoon of South Asia|the Asian monsoon]] due to continental heating via the high [[Tibetan Plateau]] causes [[Greater Somalia]] to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location.\n\nAverage annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around {{convert|31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the afternoon and {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} around sunrise. Rainfall is very high away from cold ocean current upwelling zones, from {{convert|2500|to|3500|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} per year. There are about 200 rainy days per year and average annual sunshine hours are around 2,000. Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the [[Andes]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have glaciers. The highest point on the equator is at the elevation of {{convert|4690|m|0}}, at {{coord|0|0|0|N|77|59|31|W|type:landmark_region:EC|name=highest point on the equator}}, found on the southern slopes of [[Volc\u00e1n Cayambe]] [summit {{convert|5790|m|0}}] in [[Ecuador]]. This is slightly above the [[snow line]] and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground. At the equator the snow line is around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} ''lower'' than on [[Mount Everest]] and as much as {{convert|2000|m|ft}} lower than the highest snow line in the world, near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on [[Llullaillaco]].\n<div style=\"width:85%;\">\n{{Weather box|location = [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Brazil]] in South America\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C =

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in the ''Times' ''advertising department. Although no longer used by ''The Times'', Times New Roman is still very common in book and general printing. It has become one of the most popular and influential typefaces in history and a standard typeface on desktop computers.<ref name=\"Farey part 1\">{{cite journal|last1=Farey|first1=Dave|title=A Life and Times, Part 1|journal=Ultrabold|date=2014|issue=16|pages=16\u201325}}</ref><ref name=\"Farey part 2\">{{cite journal|last1=Farey|first1=Dave|title=A Life and Times, Part 2|journal=Ultrabold|date=2014|issue=15|pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\nTimes New Roman's creation took place through the influence of [[Stanley Morison]] of [[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]]. Morison was an artistic director at Monotype, historian of printing and informal adviser to ''The Times''. Asked to advise on a redesign, he recommended that they change their text typeface from a spindly and somewhat dated nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before.<ref name=\"oxdnb\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=H.

The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised point or cap height. Although Hutt,<ref name=\"Hutt Times Roman: a re-assessment\" /> and most other authors, describe Times New Roman as having a higher x-height than Plantin, Tracy reports based on published Monotype dimensions that in the original small metal-type sizes the difference was not great.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=197}}}} The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932.<ref name=\"The Times: A Revolution in Newspaper Printing\">{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=C.F.O.|title=The Times: A Revolution in Newspaper Printing|url=http://magazines.iaddb.org/issue/GR/1946-05-01/edition/15/page/86|work=Graphis|pages=362\u2013375}}</ref> After one year, the design was released for commercial sale.<ref name=\"Tally of Types\" /> Although Morison may not have literally drawn the design, his influence on its concept was sufficient that he felt that he could take credit for it as \"my one effort at designing a font\".{{efn|Spelling modernised. Morison wrote \"fount\", the usual spelling in British English at the time.}} In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed.<ref name=\"RyanConover2004_Roman\">{{cite book|author1=William E.

However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.

It isn't a match, but it does seem similar to the variant used by Stanley Morison in his essay on Times for A Tally of Types (1953), which he describes as \"a wide version, more suited for longer lines\". Jaspert, Berry and Johnson show that in Encyclopaedia of Typefaces as \"Times Wide\" (Series 427). Another possible link to this Berthold design is mentioned by Tracy in Letters of Credit: \u201cThis disparity in style between the roman and bold was evidently something the German Linotype company thought should be eliminated. In the version of Times Roman they issued in 1935, first called Neue Romanisch but then named Toscana, the bold lowercase was redesigned in the 'old style' mode.

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. (Morison's friend Brooke Crutchley recorded in his diary being told by Morison that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\"<ref name=\"From a Cambridge Diary\">{{cite journal |last1=Crutchley |first1=Brooke |title=From a Cambridge Diary |journal=Matrix |date=1990 |volume=10 |publisher=[[Whittington Press]]}}</ref>)\n\n==Metal type versions==\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular families of titling capitals for headlines.{{sfn|Williamson|1056|p=39}} Walter Tracy in ''Letters of Credit'', Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family.<ref name=\"Hutt Times Roman: a re-assessment\" />{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}\n\n===Titling===\nMonotype also created some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was intended for body text.<ref name=\"The Times: New roman and related founts.\" /> These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.<ref name=\"Linotype Times Eighteen\" />\n{{clear}}\n===Times Hever Titling===\n[[File:Times Hever Titling.jpg|thumb|right|Times Hever Titling from a Monotype specimen.]]\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a [[Caslon|Caslon-style]] A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous [[Bembo|Poliphilus]] design as an influence.

Series 827 modified some letters (notably the ''R'') to correspond to their appearance in other typefaces popular in French printing.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point bodies. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).\n{{clear}}\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype took advantage of this popularity by commissioning a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version.{{sfn|Williamson|1056|p=103}}\n\nAn early use of Times New Roman outside its origin was by [[Daniel Berkeley Updike]], an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013although ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.<ref name=\"Hutt Times Roman: a re-assessment\" /><ref name=\"Newspaper Design\">{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Hutt |title=Newspaper Design |date=1960 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=58-61, 106-8}}</ref>\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1056|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration.

Although no longer used by ''The Times'', Times New Roman is still very common in book and general printing. It has become one of the most popular and influential typefaces in history and a standard typeface on desktop computers.<ref name=\"Farey part 1\">{{cite journal|last1=Farey|first1=Dave|title=A Life and Times, Part 1|journal=Ultrabold|date=2014|issue=16|pages=16\u201325}}</ref><ref name=\"Farey part 2\">{{cite journal|last1=Farey|first1=Dave|title=A Life and Times, Part 2|journal=Ultrabold|date=2014|issue=15|pages=3\u201313}}</ref>\n\nTimes New Roman's creation took place through the influence of [[Stanley Morison]] of [[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]]. Morison was an artistic director at Monotype, historian of printing and informal adviser to ''The Times''. Asked to advise on a redesign, he recommended that they change their text typeface from a spindly and somewhat dated nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before.<ref name=\"oxdnb\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=H.

The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised point or cap height.

In the version of Times Roman they issued in 1935, first called Neue Romanisch but then named Toscana, the bold lowercase was redesigned in the 'old style' mode.

(Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was 'too basically circular' to be practical to condense in an attractive way.{{efn|Dreyfus shows proofs of the experimental recut of Perpetua with shortened descenders to allow tighter linespacing.<ref name=\"The Evolution of Times New Roman\" /> Morison later commented that \"it stared at the reader\".}})\n\n[[Walter Tracy]] and James Moran, who discussed the design's creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by [[Christophe Plantin]]. Moran and Tracy suggested that this actually might have been the same specimen of type from the Plantin-Moretus Museum that Plantin had been based on.<ref name=\"Anatomy of a Typeface\" /><ref name=\"Three chapters in the development of Clarendon/Ionic typefaces\" /><ref name=\"JongPurvis2005\">{{cite book|author1=Cees de Jong|author2=Alston W.

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point bodies. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).\n{{clear}}\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.
