It is the most populous municipality labelled as a \u2033town\" in Florida, and the fourth most populous such community in the United States, trailing only [[Hempstead, New York]]; [[Gilbert, Arizona]]; and [[Cary, North Carolina]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Robert Parsell Davie 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|R.P. Davie]]\nDavie was founded by Tamara Toussaint and Jake Tannebaum. The original name of the town was '''Zona'''. In 1909, R.P. Davie assisted then [[Florida Governor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] by draining  [[swampland]]s. Robert Parsell (R.P.) Davie, a developer, bought about {{convert|27000|acre|km2|0}} in the area. He built a school in Zona. In 1916, the people of the town were so grateful they renamed the town after him. It was carved out of [[Everglades]] land that was mostly underwater.\n\nDavie has always had a reputation as a \"[[Wild West|Western]]\" town, with many earlier buildings having \"[[Wild West]]\" architecture. It boasts a significant horse-owning population and once was home to many herds of cattle. In recent years, commercial and residential development has discouraged such practices, but Davie still tries to maintain a \"[[American Old West|Western]]\" feel. [[Pioneer City]], a western theme park, was located across the street from [[Flamingo Gardens]]. It was built in the 1960s and closed a few years later.\n[[File:Hurricane damage to mobile home in Davie Florida.jpg|thumb|left|Damage by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 in Davie]]\n\n===The Old Davie School===\n\nThe Davie School, designed in 1917 by [[August Geiger (architect)|August Geiger]], one of South Florida's most prominent early architects, opened its doors in 1918 with about 90 students. The Davie School was the first permanent school in the Everglades and is now Broward County's oldest existing school building. The building was in continuous use as a school until 1980.  The Davie School Foundation was established in 1984 to protect and restore the Davie School to the integrity of its earlier appearance. The Foundation in conjunction with the Town of Davie, the Broward County School Board, the Soroptimists International of Davie, the Davie Historical Society and the community at large has worked tirelessly to preserve this important piece of Broward County's history The building is now referred to as the \"Old Davie School,\" and is maintained by a collaboration of the [http://www.olddavieschool.org/ Davie School Foundation] and the [http://www.davie-fl.gov Town of Davie].\n\nIn the early 2000s two other historic buildings from the surrounding neighborhood were moved to the property adjoining the Old Davie School.  \n* The Viele House, built beginning in 1912, is the oldest residential structure remaining in Davie and is an excellent example of vernacular architecture. It survived the hurricane of 1926 and the floods of 1947.  It was continuously occupied by members of the Viele family until being moved to the Old Davie School property.  Regrettably, the Viele House was sealed to accommodate a modern air conditioning system, as part of the permanent preservation plan.  One of the most important features of the original structure was the non-electric \"air conditioned\" design of the home.  Specifically, warm air was drawn up and out through the opening in the top of the attic.  The natural air flow kept the home relatively comfortable, even in the hot south Florida climate.  Also, as with most of the old Davie homes, the Viele House was elevated on pillars, which permitted the breeze to blow under the building.\n* In 2004 the former home of Colonel Charles A. & Katherine M. Walsh (1912\u20131932) and the Bud & Betty Osterhoudt family (1958\u20132004) was also moved to the site.\n\n===Jewish Davie===\nIn the 1970s Davie had the reputation of not being hospitable to Jews. Davie was rumored to be the seat of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in South Florida; a cross was burned on the front lawn of a new Jewish family in 1977. This provoked an outpouring of community support which persuaded the family to remain, insisting that \"never would they see anti-Semitism like that again.\" As of 2016, Davie has a thriving Jewish community.  There are [[Chabad house]]s, and a K-12 Jewish day school.\n\n==Geography==\nDavie is located at {{Coord|26.081426|-80.280223|type:city_region:US-FL|format=dms}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|92.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|90.4|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|2.2|km2|order=flip}} (2.32%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 5859\n|1980= 20500\n|1990= 47217\n|2000= 75720\n|2010= 91992\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106558\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Davie Demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Davie||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||91,922||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+21.5%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||2,636.8/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||80.1%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||56.8%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||8.0%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||29.1%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||4.6%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||3.1%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.8%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\nAs of 2010, there were 37,306 households, with 8.0% being vacant.

It is the most populous municipality labelled as a \u2033town\" in Florida, and the fourth most populous such community in the United States, trailing only [[Hempstead, New York]]; [[Gilbert, Arizona]]; and [[Cary, North Carolina]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Robert Parsell Davie 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|R.P. Davie]]\nDavie was founded by Tamara Toussaint and Jake Tannebaum. The original name of the town was '''Zona'''. In 1909, R.P. Davie assisted then [[Florida Governor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] by draining  [[swampland]]s. Robert Parsell (R.P.) Davie, a developer, bought about {{convert|27000|acre|km2|0}} in the area. He built a school in Zona. In 1916, the people of the town were so grateful they renamed the town after him. It was carved out of [[Everglades]] land that was mostly underwater.\n\nDavie has always had a reputation as a \"[[Wild West|Western]]\" town, with many earlier buildings having \"[[Wild West]]\" architecture. It boasts a significant horse-owning population and once was home to many herds of cattle. In recent years, commercial and residential development has discouraged such practices, but Davie still tries to maintain a \"[[American Old West|Western]]\" feel. [[Pioneer City]], a western theme park, was located across the street from [[Flamingo Gardens]]. It was built in the 1960s and closed a few years later.\n[[File:Hurricane damage to mobile home in Davie Florida.jpg|thumb|left|Damage by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 in Davie]]\n\n===The Old Davie School===\n\nThe Davie School, designed in 1917 by [[August Geiger (architect)|August Geiger]], one of South Florida's most prominent early architects, opened its doors in 1918 with about 90 students. The Davie School was the first permanent school in the Everglades and is now Broward County's oldest existing school building. The building was in continuous use as a school until 1980.  The Davie School Foundation was established in 1984 to protect and restore the Davie School to the integrity of its earlier appearance. The Foundation in conjunction with the Town of Davie, the Broward County School Board, the Soroptimists International of Davie, the Davie Historical Society and the community at large has worked tirelessly to preserve this important piece of Broward County's history The building is now referred to as the \"Old Davie School,\" and is maintained by a collaboration of the [http://www.olddavieschool.org/ Davie School Foundation] and the [http://www.davie-fl.gov Town of Davie].\n\nIn the early 2000s two other historic buildings from the surrounding neighborhood were moved to the property adjoining the Old Davie School.  \n* The Viele House, built beginning in 1912, is the oldest residential structure remaining in Davie and is an excellent example of vernacular architecture. It survived the hurricane of 1926 and the floods of 1947.  It was continuously occupied by members of the Viele family until being moved to the Old Davie School property.  Regrettably, the Viele House was sealed to accommodate a modern air conditioning system, as part of the permanent preservation plan.  One of the most important features of the original structure was the non-electric \"air conditioned\" design of the home.  Specifically, warm air was drawn up and out through the opening in the top of the attic.  The natural air flow kept the home relatively comfortable, even in the hot south Florida climate.  Also, as with most of the old Davie homes, the Viele House was elevated on pillars, which permitted the breeze to blow under the building.\n* In 2004 the former home of Colonel Charles A. & Katherine M. Walsh (1912\u20131932) and the Bud & Betty Osterhoudt family (1958\u20132004) was also moved to the site.\n\n===Jewish Davie===\nIn the 1970s Davie had the reputation of not being hospitable to Jews. Davie was rumored to be the seat of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in South Florida; a cross was burned on the front lawn of a new Jewish family in 1977. This provoked an outpouring of community support which persuaded the family to remain, insisting that \"never would they see anti-Semitism like that again.\" As of 2016, Davie has a thriving Jewish community.

After the pollen distribution, the stamens become ash-gray and fall off after a few days. Later all the male inflorescences also fall off. The greenish female flowers, with hairy and tubular perianth, have a fleshy flower-like base. The female flowers contain an ovary with a broad, capitate or rarely bilobed scar. The blooming time ranges from December until February or March.\n\nThe ellipsoidal to roundish fruit is a [[multiple fruit]] formed from the fusion of the ovaries of multiple flowers. The fruits grow on a long and thick stem on the trunk. They vary in size and ripen from an initially yellowish-greenish to yellow, and then at maturity to yellowish-brown. They possess a hard, gummy shell with small pimples surrounded with hard, hexagonal [[tubercle]]s. The large and variously shaped fruit have a length of 30 to 100 centimeters and a diameter of 15 to 50 centimeters and can weigh 10-25 kilograms or more.<ref name=Jackfruit/>\n\nThe fruits consist of a fibrous, whitish core ([[rachis]]) about 5-10 centimeters thick. Radiating from this are many 10 centimeter long individual fruits. They are elliptical to egg-shaped, light brownish [[achene]]s with a length of about 3 centimeters and a diameter of 1.5 to 2 centimeters.\n\nThere may be about 100-500 seeds per fruit. The seed coat consists of a thin, waxy, parchment-like and easily removable testa (husk) and a brownish, membranous [[Seed#Seed coat|tegmen]]. The [[cotyledon]]s are usually unequal in size, and the [[endosperm]] is minimally present.<ref>{{cite book|author=N.

The bean-shaped achenes of the jackfruit are coated with a firm yellowish [[aril]] (seed coat, flesh), which has an intense sweet taste at maturity of the fruit. The pulp is enveloped by many narrow strands of fiber (undeveloped [[perianth]]), which run between the hard shell and the core of the fruit and are firmly attached to it. When pruned, the inner part (core) secretes a sticky, milky liquid,<ref name=Jackfruit/> which can hardly be removed from the skin, even with soap and water. To clean the hands after \"unwinding\" the pulp an oil or other solvent is used. For example, street vendors in Tanzania, who sell the fruit in small segments, provide small bowls of kerosene for their customers to cleanse their sticky fingers. When fully ripe, jackfruit has a strong pleasant aroma, the pulp of the opened fruit resembles the odor of pineapple and banana.<ref name=Jackfruit/>\n\n==As food==\n[[File:Jackfruit Flesh.jpg|thumb|right|Jackfruit flesh]]\nRipe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle pineapple- or banana-like flavoring.<ref name=Jackfruit/> It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice as ''[[es teler]]'' in Indonesia or ''[[halo-halo]]'' in the Philippines. For the traditional breakfast dish in southern India, ''[[idli]]s'', the fruit is used with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit ''[[dosa]]s'' can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter. Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried, or [[Freeze-drying#Food industry|freeze-dried]] and sold as jackfruit chips.\n\nThe [[seed]]s from ripe fruits are edible, and are said to have a milky, sweet taste often compared to [[Brazil nut]]s. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted.<ref name=Jackfruit/> When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts. In Java, the seeds are commonly cooked and seasoned with salt as a snack. They are commonly used in curry in India in the form of a traditional lentil and vegetable mix curry. Young leaves are tender enough to be used as a vegetable.<ref name=Jackfruit/>\n\n===Aroma===\nJackfruit has a distinctive sweet and fruity aroma. In a study of flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main [[Volatile organic compound|volatile compounds]] detected were [[ethyl isovalerate]], propyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, isobutyl isovalerate, [[3-methylbutyl acetate]], [[1-butanol]], and [[2-methylbutan-1-ol]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ong |first1=B.T. |last2=Nazimah |first2=S.A.H. |last3=Tan |first3=C.P. |last4=Mirhosseini |first4=H. |last5=Osman |first5=A. |last6=Hashim |first6=D.

The final chunks resemble prepared [[artichoke heart]]s in their mild taste, color, and flowery qualities.\n\nThe cuisines of many Asian countries use cooked young jackfruit.<ref name=janick /> In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food. The boiled young jackfruit is used in salads or as a vegetable in spicy curries and side dishes, and as fillings for [[cutlet]]s and chops. It may be used by vegetarians as a substitute for meat such as pulled pork. It may be cooked with coconut milk and eaten alone or with meat, shrimp or smoked pork. In southern India, unripe jackfruit slices are deep-fried to make chips.\n\n====South Asia====\nIn Bangladesh, the fruit is consumed on its own. The unripe fruit is used in curry, and the seed is often dried and preserved to be later used in curry.<ref name=\"The Daily Star\"/> In India, two varieties of jackfruit predominate: ''muttomvarikka'' and ''sindoor''. ''Muttomvarikka'' has a slightly hard inner flesh when ripe, while the inner flesh of the ripe ''sindoor'' fruit is soft.<ref>{{cite thesis|title=Morpho-Molecular Characterization of Jackfruit.

The fruits are either eaten alone or as a side to rice. The juice is extracted and either drunk straight or as a side. The juice is sometimes condensed and eaten as candies. The seeds are either boiled or roasted and eaten with salt and hot chilies. They are also used to make spicy side dishes with rice.

The ripe fruit, besides also being eaten raw as it is, is also preserved by storing in syrup or by drying. The seeds are also boiled before being eaten.\n\nThailand is a major producer of jackfruit, which are often cut, prepared, and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags or boxes without syrup) and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe.\n\nIn Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit ''[[ch\u00e8]]'', a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative ''bubur cha cha''. The Vietnamese also use jackfruit pur\u00e9e as part of pastry fillings or as a topping on ''[[x\u00f4i]] ng\u1ecdt'' (a sweet version of sticky rice portions).\n\nJackfruits are found primarily in the eastern part of Taiwan.

The seeds are then dispersed by these animals, spreading jackfruit trees that compete for space with native tree species. The supply of jackfruit has allowed the marmoset and coati populations to expand. Since both prey opportunistically on bird eggs and nestlings, the increases in marmoset and coati populations are detrimental to local birds.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia]]\n* [[Breadfruit]] -  a related species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] tree in the [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] family,  originating in the South Pacific\n* [[Durian]] - a fruit similar in appearance but from an unrelated tree, also from South East Asia.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cookbook-inline|Jackfruit}}\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Artocarpus heterophyllus|''Artocarpus heterophyllus''}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Artocarpus heterophyllus|''Artocarpus heterophyllus''}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|jackfruit}}\n\n{{Symbols of Bangladesh}}\n{{Nuts}}\n{{Non-timber forest products}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q45757}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Artocarpus]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from India]]\n[[Category:Flora of India (region)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Fruits originating in Asia]]\n[[Category:Meat substitutes]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Bangladesh]]\n[[Category:Non-timber forest products]]\n[[Category:Southeast Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Tropical agriculture]]\n[[Category:Tropical fruit]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of flowering plant in the fig and mulberry family Moraceae}}\n{{speciesbox\n|name =\n|image = Jackfruit hanging.JPG\n|image_caption =\n|genus = Artocarpus\n|species = heterophyllus\n|authority = [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lam.]]<ref name=lam>Under its accepted name ''Artocarpus heterophyllus'' (then as ''heterophylla'') this species was described in ''Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, Botanique'' 3: 209.

It easily reaches heights of 10 to 20 meters and trunk diameters of 30 to 80 centimeters. It sometimes forms [[buttress root]]s. The bark of the jackfruit tree is reddish-brown and smooth. In the event of injury to the bark, a milky juice is released.\n\nThe leaves are [[Alternate leaf|alternate]] and spirally arranged. They are gummy and thick and are divided into a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] and a leaf blade. The petiole is 1 to 3 inches long. The leathery leaf blade is 7 to 15 inches long, and 3 to 7 inches wide and is oblong to [[Ovate (leaf)|ovate]] in shape.\n\nIn young trees, the leaf edges are irregularly lobed or split. On older trees, the leaves are rounded and dark green, with a smooth leaf margin. The leaf blade has a prominent main [[Leaf vein|nerve]] and starting on each side six to eight lateral nerves.

The male flowers are hairy and the [[perianth]] ends with two 1 to 1.5 millimeters membrane. The individual and prominent [[stamen]]s are straight with yellow, roundish anthers. After the pollen distribution, the stamens become ash-gray and fall off after a few days. Later all the male inflorescences also fall off. The greenish female flowers, with hairy and tubular perianth, have a fleshy flower-like base. The female flowers contain an ovary with a broad, capitate or rarely bilobed scar. The blooming time ranges from December until February or March.\n\nThe ellipsoidal to roundish fruit is a [[multiple fruit]] formed from the fusion of the ovaries of multiple flowers. The fruits grow on a long and thick stem on the trunk. They vary in size and ripen from an initially yellowish-greenish to yellow, and then at maturity to yellowish-brown. They possess a hard, gummy shell with small pimples surrounded with hard, hexagonal [[tubercle]]s. The large and variously shaped fruit have a length of 30 to 100 centimeters and a diameter of 15 to 50 centimeters and can weigh 10-25 kilograms or more.<ref name=Jackfruit/>\n\nThe fruits consist of a fibrous, whitish core ([[rachis]]) about 5-10 centimeters thick. Radiating from this are many 10 centimeter long individual fruits. They are elliptical to egg-shaped, light brownish [[achene]]s with a length of about 3 centimeters and a diameter of 1.5 to 2 centimeters.\n\nThere may be about 100-500 seeds per fruit. The seed coat consists of a thin, waxy, parchment-like and easily removable testa (husk) and a brownish, membranous [[Seed#Seed coat|tegmen]]. The [[cotyledon]]s are usually unequal in size, and the [[endosperm]] is minimally present.<ref>{{cite book|author=N.

The bean-shaped achenes of the jackfruit are coated with a firm yellowish [[aril]] (seed coat, flesh), which has an intense sweet taste at maturity of the fruit. The pulp is enveloped by many narrow strands of fiber (undeveloped [[perianth]]), which run between the hard shell and the core of the fruit and are firmly attached to it. When pruned, the inner part (core) secretes a sticky, milky liquid,<ref name=Jackfruit/> which can hardly be removed from the skin, even with soap and water. To clean the hands after \"unwinding\" the pulp an oil or other solvent is used. For example, street vendors in Tanzania, who sell the fruit in small segments, provide small bowls of kerosene for their customers to cleanse their sticky fingers. When fully ripe, jackfruit has a strong pleasant aroma, the pulp of the opened fruit resembles the odor of pineapple and banana.<ref name=Jackfruit/>\n\n==As food==\n[[File:Jackfruit Flesh.jpg|thumb|right|Jackfruit flesh]]\nRipe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle pineapple- or banana-like flavoring.<ref name=Jackfruit/> It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice as ''[[es teler]]'' in Indonesia or ''[[halo-halo]]'' in the Philippines. For the traditional breakfast dish in southern India, ''[[idli]]s'', the fruit is used with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit ''[[dosa]]s'' can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter. Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried, or [[Freeze-drying#Food industry|freeze-dried]] and sold as jackfruit chips.\n\nThe [[seed]]s from ripe fruits are edible, and are said to have a milky, sweet taste often compared to [[Brazil nut]]s. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted.<ref name=Jackfruit/> When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts. In Java, the seeds are commonly cooked and seasoned with salt as a snack.

Young (unripe) jackfruit is made into curry called ''[[gulai]] nangka'' or stewed called ''[[gudeg]]''.\n\nIn the Philippines, jackfruit is called ''langka'' in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and ''{{lang|ceb|nangk\u00e0}}''<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Nangk\u00e0|last      = Wolff|first     = John U. |encyclopedia     = A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan|year      = 1972 |url       = http://gutenberg.ph/previews/wolff/WCED-complete.pdf#page=776&zoom=auto,-76,270 |page= 698|volume = 2}}</ref> in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].

The ripe fruit, besides also being eaten raw as it is, is also preserved by storing in syrup or by drying. The seeds are also boiled before being eaten.\n\nThailand is a major producer of jackfruit, which are often cut, prepared, and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags or boxes without syrup) and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe.\n\nIn Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit ''[[ch\u00e8]]'', a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative ''bubur cha cha''. The Vietnamese also use jackfruit pur\u00e9e as part of pastry fillings or as a topping on ''[[x\u00f4i]] ng\u1ecdt'' (a sweet version of sticky rice portions).\n\nJackfruits are found primarily in the eastern part of Taiwan. The fresh fruit can be eaten directly or preserved as dried fruit, candied fruit, or jam.

The seeds are boiled in water or roasted to remove toxic substances, and then roasted for a variety of desserts. The flesh of the unripe jackfruit is used to make a savory salty dish with smoked pork. The jackfruit arils are used to make jams or fruits in syrup, and can also be eaten raw.\n\n==Wood and manufacturing==\nThe golden yellow timber with good grain is used for building furniture and house construction in India. It is termite-proof{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} and is superior to teak for building furniture. The wood of the jackfruit tree is important in Sri Lanka and is exported to Europe.

In Indonesia, hardwood from the trunk is carved out to form the barrels of drums used in the ''[[gamelan]]'', and in the Philippines, its soft wood is made into the body of the ''[[kutiyapi]]'', a type of boat [[lute]]. It is also used to make the body of the Indian string instrument ''[[veena]]'' and the drums ''[[mridangam]]'', ''[[thimila]]'', and ''[[kanjira]]''.\n\n==Cultural significance==\nThe jackfruit has played a significant role in Indian agriculture for centuries.

The Tijuca is mostly an artificial [[secondary forest]], whose planting began during the mid-nineteenth century; jackfruit trees have been a part of the park's flora since it was founded.\n\nThe species has expanded excessively because its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals, such as the [[common marmoset]] and [[coati]]. The seeds are then dispersed by these animals, spreading jackfruit trees that compete for space with native tree species. The supply of jackfruit has allowed the marmoset and coati populations to expand. Since both prey opportunistically on bird eggs and nestlings, the increases in marmoset and coati populations are detrimental to local birds.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia]]\n* [[Breadfruit]] -  a related species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] tree in the [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] family,  originating in the South Pacific\n* [[Durian]] - a fruit similar in appearance but from an unrelated tree, also from South East Asia.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cookbook-inline|Jackfruit}}\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Artocarpus heterophyllus|''Artocarpus heterophyllus''}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Artocarpus heterophyllus|''Artocarpus heterophyllus''}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|jackfruit}}\n\n{{Symbols of Bangladesh}}\n{{Nuts}}\n{{Non-timber forest products}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q45757}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Artocarpus]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from India]]\n[[Category:Flora of India (region)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Fruits originating in Asia]]\n[[Category:Meat substitutes]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Bangladesh]]\n[[Category:Non-timber forest products]]\n[[Category:Southeast Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Tropical agriculture]]\n[[Category:Tropical fruit]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4042:2e19:6f41:31db:58e0:1c6:e126", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackfruit"}

The battles were a part of the India-Pakistan War and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. The series of naval operations began with the [[Indian Navy]] exerting pressure from the seas, while the Indian Army and Indian Air Force moved in to close the ring round East Pakistan on land. The naval operations incorporated the [[Maritime Interdiction Operations|naval interdiction]], air defence, ground support, and logistics missions.\n\nWith the success of the Indian Navy's operations in East Pakistan, the Indian Navy commenced two large-scale operations, [[Operation Trident (Indo-Pakistani War of 1971)|Operation Trident]] and [[Operation Python]] on the Western front, prior to the start of formal conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Operation Dwarka}}\nThe Indian Navy did not play a major role during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] as the war focused on land-based conflict.

Consequently, the Indian Navy budget grew from {{INR}}350&nbsp;million to {{INR}}1.15&nbsp;billion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Indian Navy added a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] to its combatant fleet by acquiring six {{sclass2-|Osa|missile boat|1}}s from the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Indian Naval Air Arm]] was also strengthened.\n\n==Pakistani Navy in East Pakistan==\n{{Main|Operation Searchlight|Operation Barisal|East Pakistan Air Operations, 1971}}\nThe [[Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan|Eastern Command]] was established in 1969 and Rear-Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] (later four-star Admiral) was made naval commander in that region. Admiral Shariff administratively ran the Navy, and was credited for leading the administrative operations. Under his command, [[Special Service Group Navy|SSG(N)]], [[Pakistan Marines]] and SEAL teams were established, running both covert and overt operations in the Eastern Command.\n\nThe Pakistan Naval Forces had inadequate ships to challenge the Indian Navy on both fronts, and the [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] was unable to protect these ships from the Indian Air Force and Indian Naval Air Arm. Furthermore, [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]] of Pakistan Navy, Vice-Admiral [[Muzaffar Hassan]], had ordered the navy to deploy all naval power on the [[West Pakistan|Western Front]]. Most of the Pakistan Navy's combatant vessels were deployed in West Pakistan and only one destroyer, PNS ''Sylhet'', was assigned in East Pakistan, on the personal request of Admiral Shariff.\n[[File:Banair71a.PNG|230px|right|thumb|Locations of Pakistan Navy's Combatant forces on December 1971 in and around East Pakistan.

Faced with overwhelming opposition, the navy planned to remain in the ports when war broke out.<ref>[[Salik, Siddiq]], ''Witness to Surrender'', p 135</ref>\n\nIn the eastern wing, the Pakistan Navy heavily depended on her gun boat squadron.<ref>Salik, Siddiq, ''Witness To Surrender'', p134</ref> The Pakistan's Eastern Naval Command was in direct command of Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Rear-Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] who also served as the right-hand of Lieutenant-General Niazi. The Pakistan Navy had 4 gun boats (PNS ''Jessore'', ''Rajshahi'', ''Comilla'', and ''Sylhet''). The boats were capable of attaining maximum speed of 20 knots (37&nbsp;km/h), were crewed by 29 sailors. Known as Pakistan Navy's brown water navy, the gun boats were equipped with various weapons, including heavy machine guns. The boats were adequate for patrolling and anti-insurgency operations but they were hopelessly out of place in conventional warfare.<ref>Salik, Siddiq, ''Witness To Surrender'', p135</ref>\n\nIn the early of April, the Pakistan Navy began naval operations around East Pakistan to support the Army's execution of [[Operation Searchlight]]. Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff had coordinated all of these missions. On 26 April, the Pakistan Navy successfully completed [[Operation Barisal]], but it resulted in the temporary occupation of city of Barisal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nBloody urban [[guerrilla warfare]] ensued and [[Operation Jackpot]] severely damaged the operational capability of Pakistan Navy. Before the start of the hostilities, all naval gun boats were stationed at the [[Chittagong]].<ref>Bangladesh at War, Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M. Bir Uttam, p 211</ref> As the air operations began, the IAF aircraft damaged the ''Rajshahi'', while the ''Comilla'' was sunk on 4 December. On 5 December, the IAF sank two patrol boats in Khulna. The PNS ''Sylhet'' was destroyed on 6 December and the ''Balaghat'' on 9 December by Indian aircraft. On 11 December, the PNS ''Jessore'' was destroyed, while ''Rajshahi'' was repaired. The ''Rajashahi'' under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Shikder Hayat managed to evade the Indian blockade and reach Malaysia before the surrender on 16 December.\n\n==Naval operations in the Eastern theatre==\n{{Main|PNS Ghazi|Sinking of PNS Ghazi|Operation Jackpot}}\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.jpg|thumbnail|right|Indian carrier [[INS Vikrant (R11)|''Vikrant'']] played a key role in enforcing a naval blockade over East Pakistan]]\nThe Indian Navy started covert naval operations, which were part of a larger operation named Operation Sea Sight which were executed successfully. In the end months of 1971, the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command had effectively applied a [[naval blockade]] that completely isolated East Pakistan's [[Bay of Bengal]], trapping the Eastern Pakistan Navy and eight foreign merchant ships in their ports. The Pakistan Army's Combatant High Command, The GHQ, insisted and pressured the Pakistan Navy to deploy PNS Ghazi and to extend its sphere of naval operations into East Pakistan shores.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Officer in Command of Submarine Service Branch of Pakistan Navy opposed the idea of deploying an aging submarine, PNS Ghazi, in the Bay of Bengal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It was difficult to sustain prolonged operations in a distant area in the total absence of repair, logistics, and recreational facilities in the vicinity. At this time, submarine repair facilities were absent at Chittagong, the only sea port in the east during this period. Her commander and other officers objected the plan as when it was proposed by the senior Army and Naval officers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn the Eastern wing of Pakistan, the Pakistan Navy had never maintained a squadron of warships, despite the calls made by Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Instead, a brown water navy was formed consisting a gun boats riverine craft on a permanent basis. Consequently, in eastern wing, repair and logistic facilities were not developed at Chittagong. The Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command virtually faced no opposition from Eastern theatre. The [[aircraft carrier]] INS ''Vikrant'', along with her escort [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]] ships [[INS Guldar (L21)|INS ''Guldar'']], INS ''Gharial'', INS ''Magar'', and the submarine [[INS Khanderi (1968)|INS ''Khanderi'']], executed their operations independently.\n\nOn 4 December 1971, the aircraft carrier {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} was also deployed and its [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] attack aircraft contributed to [[East Pakistan Air Operations, 1971|Air Operations]] in East Pakistan. The aircraft successfully attacked many coastal towns in East Pakistan including Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar.

It also eliminated the threat posed by the Pakistan Navy to Indian Eastern Naval Command. On reconnaissance mission, the ''Ghazi'' was ordered to report back to her garrison on 26 November, and admitted a report Naval Combatant Headquarter, NHQ. However, it was failed to return to her garrison. Anxiety grew day by day at the NHQ and NHQ had pressed frantic efforts to establish communications with the submarine failed to produce results. By 3 December prior to starting of the war, the doubts about the fate of submarine had already begun to agitate the commanders at the Naval Headquarter (NHQ).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nOn 5/6 December 1971, naval air operations were carried out Chittagong, Khulna, and Mangla harbours, and at ships in the Pussur river. The oil installations were destroyed at Chittagong, and the Greek merchant ship ''Thetic Charlie'' was sunk at the outer anchorage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} On 7/8 December, the airfields of PAF were destroyed, and the campaign continued until 9 December. On 12 December, Pakistan Navy laid mines on amphibious landing approaches to [[Chittagong]]. This proved a useful trap for some time, and it had denied any direct access to Chittagong port for a long time, even after the instrument of surrender had been signed. The Indian Navy therefore decided to carry out an amphibious landing at [[Cox's Bazar]] with the aim cutting off the line of retreat for Pakistan Army troops. On 12 December, additional amphibious battalion was aboard on INS Vishwa Vijaya was sailed from Calcutta port. On the night of 15/16 December, the amphibious landing was carried out, immediately after IAF bombardment of the beach a day earlier. After fighting for days, the human cost was very high for Pakistani forces, and no opposition or resistance was offered by Pakistani forces to Indian forces. During this episode Eastern theatre Indian forces suffered only 2 deaths in the operation. Meanwhile, Pakistani forces were reported to have suffered hundreds of deaths. By the dawn of 17 December, the Indian Navy was free to operate at will in the Bay of Bengal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFurthermore, the successful Indian Air Operations and Operation Jackpot, led by the Bengali units with the support of Indian Army, undermined the operational capability of Pakistan Navy.

Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's [[maritime trade]], meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan's economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any airstrikes or naval strikes. Karachi received some of the best defences Pakistan had to offer as well as cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.

The battles were a part of the India-Pakistan War and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. The series of naval operations began with the [[Indian Navy]] exerting pressure from the seas, while the Indian Army and Indian Air Force moved in to close the ring round East Pakistan on land. The naval operations incorporated the [[Maritime Interdiction Operations|naval interdiction]], air defence, ground support, and logistics missions.\n\nWith the success of the Indian Navy's operations in East Pakistan, the Indian Navy commenced two large-scale operations, [[Operation Trident (Indo-Pakistani War of 1971)|Operation Trident]] and [[Operation Python]] on the Western front, prior to the start of formal conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Operation Dwarka}}\nThe Indian Navy did not play a major role during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] as the war focused on land-based conflict. On 7 September, a [[flotilla]] of the Pakistan Navy under the command of Commodore S.M. Anwar carried out a bombardment, Operation Dwarka, of the Indian Navy's radar station of Dwarka, {{convert|200|mi|km}} south of the Pakistani port of [[Karachi]]. While there was no damage to the radar station,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/history/1965war/1150-dwarka.html |title=The Shelling Of Dwarka |website=bharat-rakshak.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> this operation caused the Indian Navy to undergo a rapid modernization and expansion. Consequently, the Indian Navy budget grew from {{INR}}350&nbsp;million to {{INR}}1.15&nbsp;billion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Indian Navy added a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] to its combatant fleet by acquiring six {{sclass2-|Osa|missile boat|1}}s from the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Indian Naval Air Arm]] was also strengthened.\n\n==Pakistani Navy in East Pakistan==\n{{Main|Operation Searchlight|Operation Barisal|East Pakistan Air Operations, 1971}}\nThe [[Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan|Eastern Command]] was established in 1969 and Rear-Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] (later four-star Admiral) was made naval commander in that region. Admiral Shariff administratively ran the Navy, and was credited for leading the administrative operations. Under his command, [[Special Service Group Navy|SSG(N)]], [[Pakistan Marines]] and SEAL teams were established, running both covert and overt operations in the Eastern Command.\n\nThe Pakistan Naval Forces had inadequate ships to challenge the Indian Navy on both fronts, and the [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] was unable to protect these ships from the Indian Air Force and Indian Naval Air Arm. Furthermore, [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]] of Pakistan Navy, Vice-Admiral [[Muzaffar Hassan]], had ordered the navy to deploy all naval power on the [[West Pakistan|Western Front]]. Most of the Pakistan Navy's combatant vessels were deployed in West Pakistan and only one destroyer, PNS ''Sylhet'', was assigned in East Pakistan, on the personal request of Admiral Shariff.\n[[File:Banair71a.PNG|230px|right|thumb|Locations of Pakistan Navy's Combatant forces on December 1971 in and around East Pakistan. Some unit locations are not shown. Map not to exact scale.]]\nDuring the conflict, East Pakistan's naval ports were left defenceless as the Eastern Command of Pakistan had decided to fight the war without the navy. Faced with overwhelming opposition, the navy planned to remain in the ports when war broke out.<ref>[[Salik, Siddiq]], ''Witness to Surrender'', p 135</ref>\n\nIn the eastern wing, the Pakistan Navy heavily depended on her gun boat squadron.<ref>Salik, Siddiq, ''Witness To Surrender'', p134</ref> The Pakistan's Eastern Naval Command was in direct command of Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Rear-Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] who also served as the right-hand of Lieutenant-General Niazi. The Pakistan Navy had 4 gun boats (PNS ''Jessore'', ''Rajshahi'', ''Comilla'', and ''Sylhet''). The boats were capable of attaining maximum speed of 20 knots (37&nbsp;km/h), were crewed by 29 sailors. Known as Pakistan Navy's brown water navy, the gun boats were equipped with various weapons, including heavy machine guns. The boats were adequate for patrolling and anti-insurgency operations but they were hopelessly out of place in conventional warfare.<ref>Salik, Siddiq, ''Witness To Surrender'', p135</ref>\n\nIn the early of April, the Pakistan Navy began naval operations around East Pakistan to support the Army's execution of [[Operation Searchlight]]. Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff had coordinated all of these missions. On 26 April, the Pakistan Navy successfully completed [[Operation Barisal]], but it resulted in the temporary occupation of city of Barisal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nBloody urban [[guerrilla warfare]] ensued and [[Operation Jackpot]] severely damaged the operational capability of Pakistan Navy. Before the start of the hostilities, all naval gun boats were stationed at the [[Chittagong]].<ref>Bangladesh at War, Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M. Bir Uttam, p 211</ref> As the air operations began, the IAF aircraft damaged the ''Rajshahi'', while the ''Comilla'' was sunk on 4 December. On 5 December, the IAF sank two patrol boats in Khulna. The PNS ''Sylhet'' was destroyed on 6 December and the ''Balaghat'' on 9 December by Indian aircraft. On 11 December, the PNS ''Jessore'' was destroyed, while ''Rajshahi'' was repaired. The ''Rajashahi'' under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Shikder Hayat managed to evade the Indian blockade and reach Malaysia before the surrender on 16 December.\n\n==Naval operations in the Eastern theatre==\n{{Main|PNS Ghazi|Sinking of PNS Ghazi|Operation Jackpot}}\n[[File:INS Vikrant (R11) with a Sea King helicopter during Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.jpg|thumbnail|right|Indian carrier [[INS Vikrant (R11)|''Vikrant'']] played a key role in enforcing a naval blockade over East Pakistan]]\nThe Indian Navy started covert naval operations, which were part of a larger operation named Operation Sea Sight which were executed successfully. In the end months of 1971, the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command had effectively applied a [[naval blockade]] that completely isolated East Pakistan's [[Bay of Bengal]], trapping the Eastern Pakistan Navy and eight foreign merchant ships in their ports. The Pakistan Army's Combatant High Command, The GHQ, insisted and pressured the Pakistan Navy to deploy PNS Ghazi and to extend its sphere of naval operations into East Pakistan shores.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Officer in Command of Submarine Service Branch of Pakistan Navy opposed the idea of deploying an aging submarine, PNS Ghazi, in the Bay of Bengal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It was difficult to sustain prolonged operations in a distant area in the total absence of repair, logistics, and recreational facilities in the vicinity. At this time, submarine repair facilities were absent at Chittagong, the only sea port in the east during this period.

On the night of 15/16 December, the amphibious landing was carried out, immediately after IAF bombardment of the beach a day earlier.
