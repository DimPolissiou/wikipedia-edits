The station is owned by the [[Rogers Media]] division of [[Rogers Communications]], as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)#Canada|twinstick]] with [[Omni Television]] outlet [[CJEO-DT]] (channel 56). The two stations share studios with Rogers' local radio stations on [[Gateway Boulevard]]. CKEM's transmitter is located near [[Yellowhead Highway]]/[[Alberta Highway 16A|Highway 16A]]; CKEM also operates a rebroadcast transmitter in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] on VHF channel 4.\n\nThis station can also be seen on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] channel 7 and in high definition on digital channel 213. On [[Shaw Direct]], the channel is available on 347 (Classic) or 022 (Advanced), and in high definition on channel 014 (Classic) or 514 (Advanced).

[[Ramsay MacDonald]], who became Labour's first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of [[Neil Kinnock]], who was Labour leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1983 to 1992.\n\nIt is one of the most consistently [[safe seat]]s for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales, however the seat saw a significant swing against Labour in 2019.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Borough of Aberavon, the Urban Districts of Briton Ferry, Glencorwg, Margam, and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural Districts of Neath and Penybont.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The Borough of Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural District of Penybont.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Afan, and the Borough of Neath wards nos. 3 and 6.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Port Talbot, and the Borough of Neath wards of Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North and Coedffranc West.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Neath Port Talbot County Borough electoral divisions of Aberavon, Baglan, Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Bryn and Cwmavon, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North, Coedffranc West, Cymmer, Glyncorrwg, Gwynfi, Margam, Port Talbot, Sandfields East, Sandfields West, and Tai-bach.\n\nThe constituency is in [[South Wales]], situated on the right bank of the [[River Afan]], near its mouth in [[Swansea Bay]].\n\nCommenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, then-MP [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|Sir John Morris]], who would retire at [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the next general election]], said:\n\n{{quote|It is a happy tradition on this occasion to refer to one's constituency and to the people who sent one here....Whatever may occur in future, I would deplore the loss of the Member-constituency link.

With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who became Labour's first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of [[Neil Kinnock]], who was Labour leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1983 to 1992.\n\nIt is one of the most consistently [[safe seat]]s for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales, however the seat saw a significant swing against Labour in 2019.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Borough of Aberavon, the Urban Districts of Briton Ferry, Glencorwg, Margam, and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural Districts of Neath and Penybont.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The Borough of Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural District of Penybont.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Afan, and the Borough of Neath wards nos. 3 and 6.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Port Talbot, and the Borough of Neath wards of Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North and Coedffranc West.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Neath Port Talbot County Borough electoral divisions of Aberavon, Baglan, Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Bryn and Cwmavon, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North, Coedffranc West, Cymmer, Glyncorrwg, Gwynfi, Margam, Port Talbot, Sandfields East, Sandfields West, and Tai-bach.\n\nThe constituency is in [[South Wales]], situated on the right bank of the [[River Afan]], near its mouth in [[Swansea Bay]].\n\nCommenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, then-MP [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|Sir John Morris]], who would retire at [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the next general election]], said:\n\n{{quote|It is a happy tradition on this occasion to refer to one's constituency and to the people who sent one here....Whatever may occur in future, I would deplore the loss of the Member-constituency link.

It was during this time that the area experienced a large influx of [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Jewish]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] settlers. In the late 14th century, Polish nobleman ([[szlachta]]), [[Micha\u0142 Awdaniec (XIV st.)|Micha\u0142 Awdaniec]], [[Abdank coat of arms]] became the owner of the town on 1360-s or 1370-s. On July 28, 1379, Micha\u0142 Awdaniec founded a Roman Catholic parish church, and built [[Buchach castle|a castle]]. {{Fact span|text=According to at least one accounting, in 1393, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]]|date=October 2019}} agreed to grant Magdeburg rights to Buchach (Buczacz): it was first Magdeburg-style city, located in the [[Halych Land (ziemia)|Halych Land]]. In the early 15th century, the Awdaniec family of Buchach changed its last name into Buczacki, after its main residence. Frequent invasions of the [[Crimean Tatars]] brought destruction to the town, and in 1515, it once again received the Magdeburg rights. In 1558 Katarzyna Tworowska nee Buczacka get the king's grant for market in Buchach. In 1580, local castle was rebuilt: the castle was twice besieged by the Tatars (1665, 1667), who finally captured it in 1672, during the [[Polish\u2013Ottoman War (1672\u20131676)]]. Buchach was a temporary residence of [[Mehmed IV]]; here, on October 18, 1672, the [[Treaty of Buchach]] was signed between [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to this treaty, Poland handed the provinces of Ukraine and [[Podolia]] to Turkey. \n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Buchach belonged to the [[Potocki family]]. [[Miko\u0142aj Bazyli Potocki]], the [[Starosta]] of  [[Kaniv]], [[Bohuslav]], the son of [[Stefan Aleksander Potocki]], [[Voivode]] of [[Belz]], who became a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] about 1758, built here [[Buchach Town Hall|Buchach cityhall]] with a 35-meter tower (near 1751), a late Baroque Roman Catholic [[Assumption church, Buchach|Church of Assumption of Mary]] (1761\u20131763), and rebuilt the castle, destroyed by the Turks. With the unification of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland and Lithuania]] in 1569, the newly united kingdom extended from the Baltic to the [[Black Sea]]. Owing to its importance as a market town, Buchach  had become a prominent trading centre linking Poland and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0456.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The old town hall of Buchach, a joint work of architect [[Bernard Meretyn]] and sculptor [[Johann Georg Pinsel]].]]\n\nIn 1772, Eastern Galicia<ref>Due to polish authors, [[Red Ruthenia]].</ref> together with other areas of south-western Poland, became a part of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] \u2014 a [[crown land|crownland]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] as part of the [[First Partition of Poland]]. Industry came to Buchach  around the end of the 19th century. Among the small-scale industries there included a brickworks, and candle and soap factory, (modern) flour mills, a textile plant, and a necktie factory. The town also boasted a brewery and a winery. The largest factory was established early in the 1900s, when the Hilfesverein concern of Vienna set up a plant for the manufacture of wooden toys in Buchach employing some 200 workers, mainly young girls. In 1912 the Stanislaviv-based Savings and [[Credit union|Credit Union]] opened a branch in Buchach, and this served as a bank for local industrialists and business.\n\nBuchach remained a part of Austria and its [[successor state]]s until the end of the First World War in 1918.

In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Buchach was the seat of a county ([[powiat]]) in [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]]. In the 1920s, Buchach was inhabited by Jews (~60%), Poles (~25%), and Ukrainians (~15%). On September 18, 1939, during the [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]], Buchach was occupied by the Red Army, and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (see [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]). In 1941, it was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]]. Before World War II, approximately 10,000 Jews (half of the local population) lived in Buchach. According to the Soviet Extraordinary Commission, approximately 7,000 Jews were killed in Buchach during the Nazi occupation.  Some were sent to Belzec, others murdered in the streets or in killing places in the forests. A few escaped to the Soviet Union or lived in the forests and fields.  In May 1943, Buchach was proclaimed [[Judenfrei]] town.\nWhen Soviets retook the town on July 21, 1944, only about 100 Jewish survivors remained.<ref>{{cite web|title=Execution Sites of Jewish Victims Investigated by Yahad-In Unum|url=http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/buchach-buczacz-ternopil-ukraine.34|website=Yahad-In Unum Interactive Map}}</ref> \nIn 1945, its Polish residents were resettled into the [[Recovered Territories| lands of western Poland]] that had previously been German, and Communist authorities closed the parish church, turning it into a storage facility. Bones of the members of the Potocki family, kept in the church cellar, were thrown out, and later buried at the local cemetery. \n\nIn 1965, the neighboring village of Nahirianka was annexed to Buchach.

Buchach was a temporary residence of [[Mehmed IV]]; here, on October 18, 1672, the [[Treaty of Buchach]] was signed between [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to this treaty, Poland handed the provinces of Ukraine and [[Podolia]] to Turkey. \n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Buchach belonged to the [[Potocki family]]. [[Miko\u0142aj Bazyli Potocki]], the [[Starosta]] of  [[Kaniv]], [[Bohuslav]], the son of [[Stefan Aleksander Potocki]], [[Voivode]] of [[Belz]], who became a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] about 1758, built here [[Buchach Town Hall|Buchach cityhall]] with a 35-meter tower (near 1751), a late Baroque Roman Catholic [[Assumption church, Buchach|Church of Assumption of Mary]] (1761\u20131763), and rebuilt the castle, destroyed by the Turks. With the unification of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland and Lithuania]] in 1569, the newly united kingdom extended from the Baltic to the [[Black Sea]]. Owing to its importance as a market town, Buchach  had become a prominent trading centre linking Poland and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0456.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The old town hall of Buchach, a joint work of architect [[Bernard Meretyn]] and sculptor [[Johann Georg Pinsel]].]]\n\nIn 1772, Eastern Galicia<ref>Due to polish authors, [[Red Ruthenia]].</ref> together with other areas of south-western Poland, became a part of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] \u2014 a [[crown land|crownland]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] as part of the [[First Partition of Poland]]. Industry came to Buchach  around the end of the 19th century. Among the small-scale industries there included a brickworks, and candle and soap factory, (modern) flour mills, a textile plant, and a necktie factory. The town also boasted a brewery and a winery. The largest factory was established early in the 1900s, when the Hilfesverein concern of Vienna set up a plant for the manufacture of wooden toys in Buchach employing some 200 workers, mainly young girls. In 1912 the Stanislaviv-based Savings and [[Credit union|Credit Union]] opened a branch in Buchach, and this served as a bank for local industrialists and business.\n\nBuchach remained a part of Austria and its [[successor state]]s until the end of the First World War in 1918.  The town was briefly a part of the independent [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] before it was captured by the [[Republic of Poland]] in July 1919 after [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War|Ukrainian-Polish War]].<ref>Andrzej Chojnowski, [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainian6PolishWarinGalicia1918hD719.htm Ukrainian-Polish War in Galicia, 1918\u201319  in the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 5 (1993)]</ref> Also, between August 10 and September 15, 1920, it was occupied by the [[Red Army]] (see [[Polish-Soviet War]]). In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Buchach was the seat of a county ([[powiat]]) in [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]]. In the 1920s, Buchach was inhabited by Jews (~60%), Poles (~25%), and Ukrainians (~15%). On September 18, 1939, during the [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]], Buchach was occupied by the Red Army, and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (see [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]). In 1941, it was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]]. Before World War II, approximately 10,000 Jews (half of the local population) lived in Buchach. According to the Soviet Extraordinary Commission, approximately 7,000 Jews were killed in Buchach during the Nazi occupation.  Some were sent to Belzec, others murdered in the streets or in killing places in the forests. A few escaped to the Soviet Union or lived in the forests and fields.  In May 1943, Buchach was proclaimed [[Judenfrei]] town.\nWhen Soviets retook the town on July 21, 1944, only about 100 Jewish survivors remained.<ref>{{cite web|title=Execution Sites of Jewish Victims Investigated by Yahad-In Unum|url=http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/buchach-buczacz-ternopil-ukraine.34|website=Yahad-In Unum Interactive Map}}</ref> \nIn 1945, its Polish residents were resettled into the [[Recovered Territories| lands of western Poland]] that had previously been German, and Communist authorities closed the parish church, turning it into a storage facility. Bones of the members of the Potocki family, kept in the church cellar, were thrown out, and later buried at the local cemetery. \n\nIn 1965, the neighboring village of Nahirianka was annexed to Buchach. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Buchach became a part of independent [[Ukraine]], and new, Ukrainian government returned the church to its rightful owners.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of

To produce the Atlantic, a multinational consortium, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic'' (SECBAT), was established. During 1963, an initial order for 60 Atlantics{{spaced ndash}} 40 for France and 20 for Germany{{spaced ndash}} was received. Follow-on orders from export customers followed shortly thereafter. It was first introduced to operational service during 1965.\n\nThe Atlantic has been operated by a number of countries, commonly performing maritime roles such as [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]]. The Atlantic is also capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions to perform ground-attack missions; a small number of aircraft were also equipped to perform [[ELINT]] operations. An updated version, the '''Atlantique 2''' or '''ATL2''', was produced by [[Dassault Aviation]] for the [[French Navy]] in the 1980s. A further improved model, the '''Atlantique 3''', was proposed during the 1990s but ultimately unbuilt. Other operators of the Atlantic have included the [[German Navy]], the [[Italian Air Force]], the [[Pakistan Navy]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].\n\n==Development==\nIn 1958, [[NATO]] produced a specification for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft to replace the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V Neptune]], with Breguet's design, the Br 1150, chosen as the winner of the competition at the end of the year. A multinational consortium, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic'' (SECBAT) was set up to develop and build the Atlantic.<ref name=\"New Atlantic p218,252\">''Air International'' November 1981, pp. 218, 252.</ref><ref>Elvert, Schirmann and Lang 2008, p. 182.</ref> The first prototype made its maiden flight at [[Toulouse]] on 21 October 1961, with the second prototype flying on 25 February 1962, followed by two preproduction aircraft with a longer fuselage in February 1963 and September 1964.<ref name=\"New Atlantic p252\">''Air International'' November 1981, p. 252.</ref>\n\n[[File:Breguet Br.1150 No. 66 24F GC 07.07.73 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Atlantic of the French Navy in service with 24 Flotille in 1973]]  \nAn initial order for 60 Atlantics{{spaced ndash}} 40 for France and 20 for Germany{{spaced ndash}} was placed in 1963, with deliveries starting in 1965 and continuing to 1968.

To produce the Atlantic, a multinational consortium, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic'' (SECBAT), was established. During 1963, an initial order for 60 Atlantics{{spaced ndash}} 40 for France and 20 for Germany{{spaced ndash}} was received. Follow-on orders from export customers followed shortly thereafter. It was first introduced to operational service during 1965.\n\nThe Atlantic has been operated by a number of countries, commonly performing maritime roles such as [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]]. The Atlantic is also capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions to perform ground-attack missions; a small number of aircraft were also equipped to perform [[ELINT]] operations. An updated version, the '''Atlantique 2''' or '''ATL2''', was produced by [[Dassault Aviation]] for the [[French Navy]] in the 1980s. A further improved model, the '''Atlantique 3''', was proposed during the 1990s but ultimately unbuilt. Other operators of the Atlantic have included the [[German Navy]], the [[Italian Air Force]], the [[Pakistan Navy]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].\n\n==Development==\nIn 1958, [[NATO]] produced a specification for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft to replace the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V Neptune]], with Breguet's design, the Br 1150, chosen as the winner of the competition at the end of the year. A multinational consortium, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic'' (SECBAT) was set up to develop and build the Atlantic.<ref name=\"New Atlantic p218,252\">''Air International'' November 1981, pp. 218, 252.</ref><ref>Elvert, Schirmann and Lang 2008, p. 182.</ref> The first prototype made its maiden flight at [[Toulouse]] on 21 October 1961, with the second prototype flying on 25 February 1962, followed by two preproduction aircraft with a longer fuselage in February 1963 and September 1964.<ref name=\"New Atlantic p252\">''Air International'' November 1981, p. 252.</ref>\n\n[[File:Breguet Br.1150 No. 66 24F GC 07.07.73 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Atlantic of the French Navy in service with 24 Flotille in 1973]]  \nAn initial order for 60 Atlantics{{spaced ndash}} 40 for France and 20 for Germany{{spaced ndash}} was placed in 1963, with deliveries starting in 1965 and continuing to 1968.

He is currently the head coach at [[Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball|Grand Canyon University]]. Previously he served as the head coach of the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] and in the same capacity at his alma mater, [[Valparaiso Crusaders men's basketball|Valparaiso]], having succeeded his father, [[Homer Drew]]. Bryce's brother, [[Scott Drew|Scott]], also coached at Valpo before becoming the head coach of the [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor Bears]]. As a player, Bryce Drew was known for his buzzer-beating shot in the first round of Valparaiso's run in the [[1998 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1998 NCAA Tournament]]. He went on to play six seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a backup point guard for the [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Charlotte Hornets]] and [[New Orleans Hornets]].\n\n==High school career==\nAfter having been exposed to basketball for years through [[Homer Drew|his father's]] head coaching position, Bryce played basketball as the point guard for Valparaiso High School in [[Valparaiso, Indiana]].  As he progressed through high school though, Drew developed a rapid heartbeat,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} which required three surgeries to repair.  Despite this difficulty, he led his team to the state final game, and was named Indiana's [[Indiana \"Mr. Basketball\" award|Mr. Basketball]] of 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winners of the Indianapolis Star Indiana Mr. Basketball title |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/02/12/indiana-mr-basketball/5428619/ |website=Indianapolis Star |publisher=Indianapolis Star}}</ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20190331063713/http://playeroftheyear.gatorade.com/winner/state He was also named the Gatorade Indiana Player of the Year] his senior season in high school after guiding his team to a 28\u20131 season with the only loss coming in the state finals in overtime to the [[Clay High School (Indiana)|South Bend Clay High School Colonials]].\n\n==College career==\nThough recruited by dozens of schools,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Drew eventually decided to attend Valparaiso University, then a member of the [[The Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]], for men's basketball.  In his four years playing, Drew collected dozens of honors and records, including being ranked in the top 15 nationally in 3-point field goal and free throw percentage and leading the team to three consecutive conference regular season and tournament championships. He collected three conference tournament MVP awards, two conference MVP awards, and is Valparaiso's all time 3-point field goal, and assist leader. He ranks second in points for Valparaiso, being passed by [[Alec Peters]] in 2017.\n\n===\"The Shot\"===\n{{details|The Shot (Valparaiso University)}}\nDuring the [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], 13-seed Valparaiso was facing 4-seed [[Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball|Ole Miss]] in the first round. Valparaiso was down 69\u201367 with 4.1 seconds remaining in the game and Mississippi's [[Ansu Sesay]] at the free throw line.  After Sesay missed both shots, the Crusaders came up with possession {{convert|94|ft|m}} from their basket, and 2.5 seconds remaining in the game.  On the inbound, the Crusaders used a play known as \"Pacer\". Jamie Sykes inbounded to Bill Jenkins, who passed the ball to Bryce Drew.  Drew made a 23-foot 3-point shot, giving him his 22nd point of the night, and clinching the Crusaders' 70\u201369 upset and advancing them in the tournament.  Drew proceeded to lead the defeat of 12-seeded [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]] 83\u201377 in overtime, with a 22-point game.  Drew and the Crusaders fell to 8-seeded [[Rhode Island Rams|Rhode Island]] by a score of 74\u201368, with Drew scoring  18 points.  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' would rank it the No.&nbsp;5 sports moment of 1998,<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/year/memorable_moments/drew_drops_in/ Drew drops in]</ref> and Drew secured his place as a Valparaiso, Indiana, celebrity along with popcorn guru [[Orville Redenbacher]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\nFollowing his rise to fame in the tournament,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Drew was selected as Valpo's first ever first round pick as the 16th selection of the [[1998 NBA draft]] by the [[Houston Rockets]].  After playing with the Rockets for two years, Drew spent one season with the [[Chicago Bulls]], and signed as a [[free agent]] for three seasons with the [[New Orleans Hornets]] (Charlotte Hornets during his first season with the team). Drew was then waived by the Hornets, and played professionally for the [[Valencia BC]] for a year.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn the summer of 2005, Drew was selected as the new assistant coach of the Valparaiso University men's basketball team.  In 2006, Bryce was elevated to the position of associate coach, furthering speculation that he would eventually inherit the head coaching position upon his father's retirement.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} When Homer Drew retired in May 2011, Bryce Drew was hired as the head coach.

He is currently the head coach at [[Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball|Grand Canyon University]]. Previously he served as the head coach of the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] and in the same capacity at his alma mater, [[Valparaiso Crusaders men's basketball|Valparaiso]], having succeeded his father, [[Homer Drew]]. Bryce's brother, [[Scott Drew|Scott]], also coached at Valpo before becoming the head coach of the [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor Bears]]. As a player, Bryce Drew was known for his buzzer-beating shot in the first round of Valparaiso's run in the [[1998 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1998 NCAA Tournament]]. He went on to play six seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a backup point guard for the [[Houston Rockets]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Charlotte Hornets]] and [[New Orleans Hornets]].\n\n==High school career==\nAfter having been exposed to basketball for years through [[Homer Drew|his father's]] head coaching position, Bryce played basketball as the point guard for Valparaiso High School in [[Valparaiso, Indiana]].  As he progressed through high school though, Drew developed a rapid heartbeat,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} which required three surgeries to repair.  Despite this difficulty, he led his team to the state final game, and was named Indiana's [[Indiana \"Mr. Basketball\" award|Mr. Basketball]] of 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winners of the Indianapolis Star Indiana Mr. Basketball title |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/02/12/indiana-mr-basketball/5428619/ |website=Indianapolis Star |publisher=Indianapolis Star}}</ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20190331063713/http://playeroftheyear.gatorade.com/winner/state He was also named the Gatorade Indiana Player of the Year] his senior season in high school after guiding his team to a 28\u20131 season with the only loss coming in the state finals in overtime to the [[Clay High School (Indiana)|South Bend Clay High School Colonials]].\n\n==College career==\nThough recruited by dozens of schools,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Drew eventually decided to attend Valparaiso University, then a member of the [[The Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]], for men's basketball.  In his four years playing, Drew collected dozens of honors and records, including being ranked in the top 15 nationally in 3-point field goal and free throw percentage and leading the team to three consecutive conference regular season and tournament championships. He collected three conference tournament MVP awards, two conference MVP awards, and is Valparaiso's all time 3-point field goal, and assist leader. He ranks second in points for Valparaiso, being passed by [[Alec Peters]] in 2017.\n\n===\"The Shot\"===\n{{details|The Shot (Valparaiso University)}}\nDuring the [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], 13-seed Valparaiso was facing 4-seed [[Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball|Ole Miss]] in the first round. Valparaiso was down 69\u201367 with 4.1 seconds remaining in the game and Mississippi's [[Ansu Sesay]] at the free throw line.  After Sesay missed both shots, the Crusaders came up with possession {{convert|94|ft|m}} from their basket, and 2.5 seconds remaining in the game.  On the inbound, the Crusaders used a play known as \"Pacer\". Jamie Sykes inbounded to Bill Jenkins, who passed the ball to Bryce Drew.  Drew made a 23-foot 3-point shot, giving him his 22nd point of the night, and clinching the Crusaders' 70\u201369 upset and advancing them in the tournament.  Drew proceeded to lead the defeat of 12-seeded [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]] 83\u201377 in overtime, with a 22-point game.  Drew and the Crusaders fell to 8-seeded [[Rhode Island Rams|Rhode Island]] by a score of 74\u201368, with Drew scoring  18 points.  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' would rank it the No.&nbsp;5 sports moment of 1998,<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/year/memorable_moments/drew_drops_in/ Drew drops in]</ref> and Drew secured his place as a Valparaiso, Indiana, celebrity along with popcorn guru [[Orville Redenbacher]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\nFollowing his rise to fame in the tournament,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Drew was selected as Valpo's first ever first round pick as the 16th selection of the [[1998 NBA draft]] by the [[Houston Rockets]].  After playing with the Rockets for two years, Drew spent one season with the [[Chicago Bulls]], and signed as a [[free agent]] for three seasons with the [[New Orleans Hornets]] (Charlotte Hornets during his first season with the team). Drew was then waived by the Hornets, and played professionally for the [[Valencia BC]] for a year.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn the summer of 2005, Drew was selected as the new assistant coach of the Valparaiso University men's basketball team.  In 2006, Bryce was elevated to the position of associate coach, furthering speculation that he would eventually inherit the head coaching position upon his father's retirement.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} When Homer Drew retired in May 2011, Bryce Drew was hired as the head coach.

In Britain, it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Animals]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Alexis-Korner.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexis Korner]], often called the father of British blues]]\nAmerican blues became known in Britain from the 1930s onwards through a number of routes, including records brought to Britain, particularly by African-American [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] stationed there in the Second World War and Cold War, merchant seamen visiting ports such as [[London]], [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Belfast]],<ref>R. F.

F.  Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), p. 22.</ref> From 1955 major British record labels [[HMV]] and [[EMI]], the latter, particularly through their subsidiary [[Decca Records]], began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to what was an emerging market.<ref name=Schwartz2007/> Many encountered blues for the first time through the [[skiffle]] craze of the second half of the 1950s, particularly the songs of [[Lead Belly]] covered by acts like [[Lonnie Donegan]]. As skiffle began to decline in the late 1950s, and [[British rock|British rock and roll]] began to dominate the charts, a number of skiffle musicians moved towards playing purely blues music.<ref name=Broken2003>M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival, 1944-2002'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), pp. 69-80.</ref>\n\nAmong these were guitarist and blues harpist [[Cyril Davies]], who ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse public house in London's [[Soho]], and guitarist [[Alexis Korner]], both of whom worked for jazz band leader [[Chris Barber]], playing in the [[R&B]] segment he introduced to his show.<ref name=Allmusic/> The club served as a focal point for British skiffle acts and Barber was responsible for bringing over American folk and blues performers, who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America. The first major artist was [[Big Bill Broonzy]], who visited England in the mid-1950s, but who, rather than his electric [[Chicago blues]], played a [[folk blues]] set to fit in with British expectations of American blues as a form of folk music. In 1957 Davies and Korner decided that their central interest was the blues and closed the skiffle club, reopening a month later as the [[London Blues and Barrelhouse Club]].<ref>L. Portis, ''Soul Trains'' (Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2002), p. 213.</ref> To this point British blues was acoustically played emulating [[Delta blues]] and [[Country blues]] styles and often part of the emerging second British folk revival. Critical in changing this was the visit of [[Muddy Waters]] in 1958, who initially shocked British audiences by playing amplified [[electric blues]], but who was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and rave reviews.<ref name=Allmusic>V.

A number of activist organisations have been established by first generation immigrants in order to represent the voice of the Sri Lankan Tamil community on the island, and several major protests have been held in order to forward various viewpoints surrounding the civil war, most notable of which was a mass demonstration in April 2009 which drew nearly 100,000 protestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.humanitariansrilanka.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SL_Diaspora_Papers_-madurika-Rasaratnam.pdf|title=Political Identity of the British Tamil Diaspora|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation have, however, generally been more emotionally detached from the politics of the civil war, giving more priority to the issues in the United Kingdom and European Union, and preferring to refrain from involving themselves into the more extreme activism surrounding the civil war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/634/1/uk_bl_ethos_493555.pdf|title=The Sri Lankan Tamils|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\nThe second generation generally do not speak Tamil fluently enough to relate to South Asian culture and media, beyond news and politics, and therefore have traditionally avoided popular Indian culture like [[Kollywood]] (music and films) and literature. A number of scholars have suggested that this points to a relative success of integration by the community.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Refugees and the Second Generation|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=40|issue=14|pages=2444\u20132462|doi=10.1080/01419870.2016.1252461|year = 2017|last1 = Bloch|first1 = Alice|last2=Hirsch|first2=Shirin|url=https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/623131/3/Bloch_and_Hirsch_ERS_2016_author_accepted_.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHowever number of Tamil Language schools where run by community groups and organisations have seen the second generation picking up spoken and written Tamil. In 2019, even a speech competition was conducted which saw around 40 second generation kids from across the UK participate.

A number of second generation have commented on how their first generation parents tend to look down on many elements of western youth culture (binge drinking, illegal drugs, promiscuity, etc.), and issues such as mental illness, homophobia, and misogyny have often received minor vocal opposition from first generation Sri Lankans.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nHowever, there are elements of Sri Lankan Tamil culture that are markedly more liberal than other South Asian communities. There is widespread tolerance towards the concept of love before marriage and the majority of Tamils are not subject to forced marriage (arranged marriages are always optional), and women are often encouraged to participate in the education and labour market prior to marriage.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/634/|title=The Sri Lankan Tamils - A comparative analysis of the experiences of the second generation in the UK and Sri Lanka|last=Cowley-Sathiakumar|first=Shanthini Rebecca|type=PhD|publisher=University of Leeds|date=August 2008}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Religion ===\nSri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindu, albeit a small Christian population also exists; much of Sri Lankan Tamil traditional culture is rooted in Hinduism and Christian Tamils find it increasingly difficult to maintain a cultural identity that is separate and distinct from Hinduism. As a result, many Christian Tamils and Hindu Tamils are culturally similar and often identify most strongly as Tamils rather than with their respective religious communities. 'Raj' argued that there has been a 'Hindu resurgence' in the UK, whereby the young second generation living in the Hindu diaspora are reconstructing and realigning themselves with the faith of their parents, although religious adherence has largely declined over time in the United Kingdom as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceres.rub.de/en/people/phds/sandhya-marla/|title=Sandhya Marla|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nChakravoty discusses how British Sri Lankan Tamil youth often carried forward elements of Tamil culture from their parents into their own daily lives, such as the widespread practice of religious rituals such as the [[Bharatnatyam]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QDgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90|title=Dance Matters: Performing India on Local and Global Stages|last=Chakravorty|first=Pallabi|last2=Gupta|first2=Nilanjana|date=2012-08-21|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136516139|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[British Indian]]\n* [[British Sri Lankans]]\n* [[British Tamils Forum]] (BTF)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Tamil Diaspora}}\n{{Sri Lankan diaspora}}\n{{AsiansinUK}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tamil}}\n[[Category:British people of Tamil descent|*]]\n[[Category:British people of Sri Lankan descent|*]]\n[[Category:Indian diaspora in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Tamil British| ]]\n[[Category:Tamil diaspora by country|British]]\n[[Category:Tamil diaspora in Europe|British]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Ethnic group\n|group= British Tamil<br />\"\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0baf\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd\"\n| image =\n|poptime= \n|popplace= [[London]]\n|langs= [[British English]]{{\u00b7}} [[Tamil language]]\n|rels= [[Hinduism]]{{\u00b7}} [[Christianity]]{{\u00b7}} [[Islam]]\n|related= [[Tamil people]]{{\u00b7}} [[British Asian]]\n}}\n{{Tamils}}\n'''British Tamils''' ({{lang-ta|\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0baf\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bb0\u0bcd}}, [piritt\u0101\u1e49iyat tami\u1e3bar]) are [[British people]] of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] origin.

A number of activist organisations have been established by first generation immigrants in order to represent the voice of the Sri Lankan Tamil community on the island, and several major protests have been held in order to forward various viewpoints surrounding the civil war, most notable of which was a mass demonstration in April 2009 which drew nearly 100,000 protestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.humanitariansrilanka.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SL_Diaspora_Papers_-madurika-Rasaratnam.pdf|title=Political Identity of the British Tamil Diaspora|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation have, however, generally been more emotionally detached from the politics of the civil war, giving more priority to the issues in the United Kingdom and European Union, and preferring to refrain from involving themselves into the more extreme activism surrounding the civil war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/634/1/uk_bl_ethos_493555.pdf|title=The Sri Lankan Tamils|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\nThe second generation generally do not speak Tamil fluently enough to relate to South Asian culture and media, beyond news and politics, and therefore have traditionally avoided popular Indian culture like [[Kollywood]] (music and films) and literature. A number of scholars have suggested that this points to a relative success of integration by the community.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Refugees and the Second Generation|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=40|issue=14|pages=2444\u20132462|doi=10.1080/01419870.2016.1252461|year = 2017|last1 = Bloch|first1 = Alice|last2=Hirsch|first2=Shirin|url=https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/623131/3/Bloch_and_Hirsch_ERS_2016_author_accepted_.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHowever number of Tamil Language schools where run by community groups and organisations have seen the second generation picking up spoken and written Tamil. In 2019, even a speech competition was conducted which saw around 40 second generation kids from across the UK participate.

A number of second generation have commented on how their first generation parents tend to look down on many elements of western youth culture (binge drinking, illegal drugs, promiscuity, etc.), and issues such as mental illness, homophobia, and misogyny have often received minor vocal opposition from first generation Sri Lankans.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nHowever, there are elements of Sri Lankan Tamil culture that are markedly more liberal than other South Asian communities. There is widespread tolerance towards the concept of love before marriage and the majority of Tamils are not subject to forced marriage (arranged marriages are always optional), and women are often encouraged to participate in the education and labour market prior to marriage.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/634/|title=The Sri Lankan Tamils - A comparative analysis of the experiences of the second generation in the UK and Sri Lanka|last=Cowley-Sathiakumar|first=Shanthini Rebecca|type=PhD|publisher=University of Leeds|date=August 2008}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Religion ===\nSri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindu, albeit a small Christian population also exists; much of Sri Lankan Tamil traditional culture is rooted in Hinduism and Christian Tamils find it increasingly difficult to maintain a cultural identity that is separate and distinct from Hinduism. As a result, many Christian Tamils and Hindu Tamils are culturally similar and often identify most strongly as Tamils rather than with their respective religious communities. 'Raj' argued that there has been a 'Hindu resurgence' in the UK, whereby the young second generation living in the Hindu diaspora are reconstructing and realigning themselves with the faith of their parents, although religious adherence has largely declined over time in the United Kingdom as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceres.rub.de/en/people/phds/sandhya-marla/|title=Sandhya Marla|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nChakravoty discusses how British Sri Lankan Tamil youth often carried forward elements of Tamil culture from their parents into their own daily lives, such as the widespread practice of religious rituals such as the [[Bharatnatyam]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QDgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90|title=Dance Matters: Performing India on Local and Global Stages|last=Chakravorty|first=Pallabi|last2=Gupta|first2=Nilanjana|date=2012-08-21|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136516139|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[British Indian]]\n* [[British Sri Lankans]]\n* [[British Tamils Forum]] (BTF)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Tamil Diaspora}}\n{{Sri Lankan diaspora}}\n{{AsiansinUK}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tamil}}\n[[Category:British people of Tamil descent|*]]\n[[Category:British people of Sri Lankan descent|*]]\n[[Category:Indian diaspora in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Tamil British| ]]\n[[Category:Tamil diaspora by country|British]]\n[[Category:Tamil diaspora in Europe|British]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Tamil"}
