It broadcasts a [[European classical music|classical music]] format; it existed as a commercial station from the early 1950s until December 2009, and as a listener-supported station since then, having then been acquired by the [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]. Programming is also simulcast on the second [[HD Radio]] channel of [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]], allowing WCRB to reach some portions of the Boston area that cannot receive 99.5, as well as [[WJMF (FM)|WJMF]] in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]] (serving nearby [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]), the second HD Radio channel of [[WCAI]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]], and W242AA (96.3) in [[Kendall Square|Kendall Square, Cambridge]] (designed to serve [[Beacon Hill, Boston]]).\n\n==History of WCRB intellectual property==\nWCRB began broadcasting on 1330&nbsp;kHz out of [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] on January 30, 1948. In 1950, the station was sold entirely to Theodore Jones, who would own the station under the name of [[Charles River Broadcasting]] until his death in 1991. Prior to that time, \"Ted\" Jones set up the Charles River Broadcast Trust to guarantee that his establishment would continue in perpetuity.\n\nAround the time Jones first acquired the station, [[WILD (AM)|WBMS]], a daytime AM radio station that had programmed classical music, changed format. Jones decided to change WCRB's format from that of a typical suburban AM station of the era to full-time classical music. FM service at 102.5 Megacycles (as MegaHertz was then known) was added by 1954 upon the purchase of the [[WHAV]] FM transmitter. FM brought WCRB's classical music format to parts of the Boston area that did not get good reception of WCRB's directional AM signal, and made improved audio quality available.\n\nIn 1961, WCRB-FM became the first Boston-area station to broadcast in multiplex stereo; for a few years prior to that, WCRB had broadcast some of its programming in stereo by carrying one channel on AM, the other on FM. WCRB was directly involved with the development of FM multiplex stereo.<ref name=\"HH\">{{cite web|url=http://hhscott.com/800-.htm|title=Stereo development at Scott|publisher=Vintage H.H. Scott Hi-Fi Stereo archive|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> Station WCRB and H. H. Scott, then of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]] developed prototype stereophonic equipment that was used to prove the \"General Electric\" multiplex method being evaluated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). H.H. Scott was an early stereophonic receiver manufacturer that developed and manufactured high-quality home stereo equipment. Once the FCC approved stereophonic broadcasting, WCRB created a special \"stereo\" studio in downtown Boston, the first in the world. There was no dual channel (stereo) studio equipment at the time. Much of the equipment was handmade by the engineering staff.\n\nWCRB is noted for many other innovations. It was the first radio station to obtain a permanent waiver of the FCC rules requiring average modulation in excess of eighty-five percent. This was necessary to preserve the dynamic range of the concert music broadcasts. The station also obtained a permanent waiver of the FCC rule that required a [[station identification]] announcement every thirty minutes. This meant that a live concert performance no longer had to be interrupted for station identification.\n\nThe WCRB engineering staff worked with the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) to codify the [[RIAA]] LP record frequency-response curve, and create the NAB standard. Other technical innovations followed. Before the early days of FM stereo broadcasting, nobody had encountered the necessity of amplitude- and phase-matching two 15&nbsp;kHz stereo leased lines. The telephone company called such a channel type \"Program channel A\". To them, as long as the frequency response and noise level matched their specifications, stereo simply meant that there would be two lines. It was just a matter of labeling them! Not so. WCRB engineering worked with AT&T to generate a specification involving matching both the phase and frequency response. This became the standard of the industry. Eventually, as stereo caught on across the country, these methods and specifications were used to install stereophonic leased lines to transmitters across the country, until they were made obsolete by the development of composite-signal studio-transmitter links. In the early days of radio, stations had full-time engineers on duty. Therefore, the WCRB engineering staff also recorded live performances for the Boston Symphony Orchestra Transcription Trust.\n\nAlthough Charles River Broadcasting had acquired other radio stations, WCRB remained as the company's flagship station.\n\nIn 1975, WCRB ended simulcasting of WCRB-FM, changing callsigns to WHET, and its format to big-band/adult standards. In 1978, Charles River Broadcasting sold off WHET (later renamed [[WRCA]]), but retained WCRB, which became increasingly successful over the years as a 24/7 classical music station.\n\n[[File:WCRB-FM 99-5 2006 radio logo.png|thumb|left|Logo under Nassau Broadcasting ownership, a similar logo was used during WCRB's later years on 102.5]]\nWCRB was under a long-term commitment by Charles River Broadcasting Trust, established by Theodore Jones, to continue to air classical music in perpetuity, and it carried no non-classical music programs. However, the decision to interpret the commitment as a request rather than a demand resulted in the announced sale of the station to [[Greater Media]] on December 19, 2005. The trustees of the Charles River Broadcast Trust had already sold off portions of the trust's property so that there was little physical property and real estate left. The AM transmitter site in Waltham was sold to a developer who built the Watermill Complex. This, and the sales of stations such as [[WWBB|WCRQ]] in Providence, Rhode Island, marked the beginning of the gradual dissolution of the Theodore Jones trust. It was upon the death of Richard L. Kaye,<ref name=\"Death\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2006/061204/nerw.html|date=December 4, 2006|first=Scott|last=Fybush|work=NorthEast Radio Watch|title=WCRB, WKLB Make the Big Switch|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> an early manager, minority stockholder, and trusted associate of Jones, that the Charles River Trust would no longer maintain the commitments made by its founder.<ref name=\"Trust\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2005/11/03/wcrb_sale_would_have_a_classical_twist/|title=WCRB sale would have a classical twist|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Clea|last=Simon|date=November 3, 2005|page=F5|accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>\n \nGreater Media already owned five FM stations in the Boston market\u2014the maximum allowed by the FCC and one of Greater Media's Boston stations would have to be sold before the company could acquire WCRB. Speculation arose that Greater Media would sell off 99.5 [[WKLB-FM]], as its Andover transmitter location provided poor overall coverage of the Boston market, in contrast to the company's other stations. These thoughts were confirmed on July 31, 2006, when Greater Media announced that it would sell the physical property of WKLB-FM and the intellectual property of WCRB to [[Nassau Broadcasting]], thus saving the commercial classical format for the Boston area, albeit on a station with poorer coverage of Boston. At the same time, Greater Media announced that the country format and intellectual property of WKLB would relocate to the prime signal of 102.5 MHz. WCRB's transition from 102.5 to 99.5 was completed on December 1, 2006 at noon local time. The first selection broadcast on the new frequency was the [[Hallelujah Chorus]] from Handel's ''Messiah''.\n\n[[File:WCRB-FM 99-5 2009 radio logo.png|thumb|right|Logo as \"99.5 All Classical\" from December 2009 to October 2011]]\nIt was announced on September 21, 2009 that the [[WGBH Educational Foundation]] would acquire WCRB from Nassau and convert the station to non-commercial operation, complementing sister station [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]].<ref name=\"wgbh-buyswcrb\">{{cite press release|title=Public media leader WGBH to acquire WCRB Radio|publisher=[[WGBH (FM)|WGBH Boston]]|date=September 21, 2009|url=http://www.wgbh.org/fck/userfiles/file/WGBH_WCRB_News.pdf|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}</ref> The sale was completed on December 1, 2009.

In 1982, WSSH evolved to a soft AC format gradually eliminating the instrumental renditions and became home to popular nighttime radio personality [[Delilah Rene]] before she became nationally syndicated. Ratings were very high through the 1980s and WSSH often led other AC stations.  By then, the station was separated from WLLH, but later gained a sister station on 1510 (now [[WMEX (AM)|WMEX]]). WSSH had high ratings and was often the top-rated adult contemporary radio station in the market throughout the 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the early 1990s, ratings went from excellent to mediocre; part of the reason was the perception that WSSH was still an [[elevator music]] station. By 1991, the station modified its format to mainstream AC by adding current product and some up-tempo AC tunes. WSSH became the third place radio station, following [[WMJX]] and [[WROR-FM|WVBF]] (now known as WROR, which subsequently became a sister station to 99.5). On December 13, 1995, the owner of WSSH, Granum Communications, changed the format to [[smooth jazz]], under the branding of '''WOAZ''' (''99.5 The Oasis''), mirroring Granum's [[KMVK|KOAI]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290762572.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+21%2C+1995&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=79&desc=Jazzy+WOAZ+whisks+mellow+WSSH+away Jazzy WOAZ whisks mellow WSSH away<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-12-15.pdf (p. 3)]</ref>\n\nThen, in 1997, Granum sold WOAZ and [[WBOS]] to [[Greater Media]], which already owned WMJX, WBCS (the incarnation of WKLB at that time) and [[WROR]] (the former WVBF and WCLB). On August 22 of that year, Greater Media swapped the frequencies of WOAZ and WKLB in a move where the format and personalities of WOAZ moved to 96.9 (adopting the call sign [[WBQT (FM)|WSJZ]]), while WKLB moved to 99.5 and became ''Country 99.5 WKLB'', where it stayed until December 1, 2006. Greater Media noted that the move was made because the 99.5 signal is stronger than that of 96.9 in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], home to many country music listeners.\n\nThe 99.5 frequency was spun off to [[Nassau Broadcasting Partners]] as a consequence of a deal where Greater Media acquired WCRB's current frequency, with 102.5 adopting the WKLB format and call sign. Nassau also acquired WCRB's call letters and programming.  Nassau already owned four classical-formatted stations in Maine affiliated with the [[World Classical Network]]. The two stations switched frequencies at noon on December 1, 2006.<ref name=\"Ticker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/11/30/its_time_for_klb_crb_fans_to_change_presets/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Clea|last=Simon|date=November 30, 2006|page=E6|title=It's time for 'KLB, 'CRB fans to change presets|accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> The last broadcast by WKLB on 99.5 was of the U.S. National Anthem.

The last air personality on 99.5, and consequently the first live voice on 102.5, was longtime midday host Carolyn Kruse. A redesigned website was launched immediately after the frequency change.\n\n==Audience==\nWCRB claimed to have about 500,000 listeners who tune into the live [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasts and the station's other programming, a longtime claim by management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} According to [[Arbitron]], the Metropolitan Boston market contains 3.8 million individuals 12 years of age or older.{{When|date=March 2012}} An FM station of WCRB's power transmitting on 102.5&nbsp;MHz could reach parts of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; and Southeastern New Hampshire.

If the WCRB programming did in fact reach half a million people, it would generate a rating of close to 12 per cent of the market.

H. Scott, Inc.]]\n\n===WCRB and the 1965 blackout===\nThe solutions developed by WCRB were not just about getting high fidelity audio from remote locations to the studio. Often they involved solutions to problems that nobody anticipated. On November 9, 1965, the northeastern U.S. experienced a [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|massive power blackout]]. WCRB had a backup power generator at its Waltham studios and also at its Needham FM transmitter site. Within a few minutes of the power failure, WCRB was back on the air. At first, nobody knew how long the power failure would last, or its extent.\n\nSoon reports came into the station that showed the widespread extent of the blackout. WCRB engineering checked the amount of diesel fuel remaining and found that it might not last more than a few more hours. The fuel vendor was notified, but there was no fuel available. A radio engineer started driving around and discovered that [[Civil Defense]] was trying to get a portable generator running which they had connected to the Waltham Hospital (since renamed). The hospital had no power, and the only generator available would not run. WCRB\u2019s station engineer suggested that the electric company back-feed power from WCRB to the hospital, using the existing distribution lines but disconnecting everybody else. The hospital was on Hope Avenue, off South Street, on the other side of [[Brandeis University]]. WCRB successfully fed power to the hospital, and the fuel from the inoperative generator was transferred to WCRB\u2019s tank. Within a few hours, WCRB had its fuel tank filled from additional donations. To have enough power available to supply the hospital, it became necessary to shut down the AM transmitter.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Translators==\n{{RadioTranslators\n| callsign = WCRB\n| width    =\n| call1    = W242AA\n| freq1    = 96.3\n| fid1     = 72093\n| watts1   = 5\n| haat1    = 80\n| class1   = D\n| city1    = Beacon Hill, Massachusetts\n| coord1   = {{coord|42|21|43.2|N|71|5|2.4|W|region:US-MA_type:landmark|name=W242AA}}\n| notes1   = \n}}\n\nWCRB was formerly carried on a separately-owned translator in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], W295BL (106.9); this ended after the translator was sold by Basic Holdings to Saga Communications in September 2019.<ref>[https://www.rbr.com/just-your-basic-translator-sale-to-saga/ RBR.com]</ref><ref>[https://news.radio-online.com/articles/b16010/Saga-Agrees-to-Acquire-FM-Translator-in-Manchester-NH news.radio-online.com]</ref> In January 2020, W295BL began carrying the third HD Radio channel of Saga-owned [[WZID]].<ref name=\"ri-wzidhd3onw269bl\">{{cite news |last1=Venta |first1=Lance |title=Double The Outlaw In New Hampshire |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/182971/double-the-outlaw-in-new-hampshire/ |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |work=RadioInsight |date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://www.classicalwcrb.org/}}\n*{{FM station data|WCRB}}\n\n'''Translator data'''\n*{{FMQ|W242AA}}\n*{{FXL|W242AA}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Radio Stations\n| list  =\n{{Boston Radio}}\n{{Cape Cod Radio}}\n}}\n{{WGBH}}\n{{NPR Massachusetts}}\n{{Classical Radio Stations in Massachusetts}}\n\n[[Category:NPR member stations]]\n[[Category:Classical music radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Lowell, Massachusetts|CRB]]\n[[Category:Media in Middlesex County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:WGBH Educational Foundation]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Massachusetts]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the Watertown, Massachusetts radio station that held the call sign WCRB 1948 to 1975|[[WRCA]]|the Waltham, Massachusetts radio station that held the call sign WCRB from 1954 to 2006|[[WKLB-FM]]}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name      = WCRB\n| image     = WCRB logo.png\n| area      = [[Greater Boston]]\n| city      = [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]\n| branding  = Classical Radio Boston<br>99.5 WCRB\n| frequency  = 99.5 [[Megahertz|MHz]] {{HD Radio}}\n| translator = 96.3 W242AA ([[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]])\n| repeater   = [[WCAI|WCAI-HD2]] ([[Woods Hole]])<br>[[WGBH (FM)|WGBH-HD2]] (Boston)<br>[[WJMF (FM)|WJMF]] ([[Smithfield, Rhode Island]])\n| airdate   = October 6, [[1948 in radio|1948]] (license, as WLLH-FM)<br>{{start date|1954}} (WCRB-FM on [[WKLB-FM|102.5]]; operated on [[WRCA|AM]] since 1948)\n| format    = [[Classical music|Classical]]\n| erp       = 27,000 [[watt]]s\n| haat      = {{Convert|199|m|ft|sp=us}}\n| class     = B\n| facility_id = 23441\n| coordinates = {{coord|42|39|14|N|71|13|00|W|region:US-MA_type:landmark|name=WCRB|display=inline,title}}\n| callsign_meaning = '''W C'''harles '''R'''iver '''B'''roadcasting (previous owner)\n| former_callsigns = WLLH-FM (1948\u20131970)<br>WSSH (1970\u20131987)<br>WSSH-FM (1987\u20131995)<br>WOAZ (1995\u20131997)<br>[[WKLB-FM]] (1997\u20132006)\n| owner   = [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]\n| sister_stations = [[WFXZ-CD]], [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]], [[WGBH-TV]], [[WGBX-TV]]\n| webcast = {{listenlive|http://www.classicalwcrb.org/}}\n| website = {{URL|http://www.classicalwcrb.org/}}\n}}\n\n'''WCRB''' (99.5 FM) is a non-commercial radio station licensed to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] and based in the [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]] area of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], which serves the [[Greater Boston]] area.

WCRB engineering worked with AT&T to generate a specification involving matching both the phase and frequency response. This became the standard of the industry. Eventually, as stereo caught on across the country, these methods and specifications were used to install stereophonic leased lines to transmitters across the country, until they were made obsolete by the development of composite-signal studio-transmitter links. In the early days of radio, stations had full-time engineers on duty. Therefore, the WCRB engineering staff also recorded live performances for the Boston Symphony Orchestra Transcription Trust.\n\nAlthough Charles River Broadcasting had acquired other radio stations, WCRB remained as the company's flagship station.\n\nIn 1975, WCRB ended simulcasting of WCRB-FM, changing callsigns to WHET, and its format to big-band/adult standards. In 1978, Charles River Broadcasting sold off WHET (later renamed [[WRCA]]), but retained WCRB, which became increasingly successful over the years as a 24/7 classical music station.\n\n[[File:WCRB-FM 99-5 2006 radio logo.png|thumb|left|Logo under Nassau Broadcasting ownership, a similar logo was used during WCRB's later years on 102.5]]\nWCRB was under a long-term commitment by Charles River Broadcasting Trust, established by Theodore Jones, to continue to air classical music in perpetuity, and it carried no non-classical music programs. However, the decision to interpret the commitment as a request rather than a demand resulted in the announced sale of the station to [[Greater Media]] on December 19, 2005. The trustees of the Charles River Broadcast Trust had already sold off portions of the trust's property so that there was little physical property and real estate left. The AM transmitter site in Waltham was sold to a developer who built the Watermill Complex. This, and the sales of stations such as [[WWBB|WCRQ]] in Providence, Rhode Island, marked the beginning of the gradual dissolution of the Theodore Jones trust. It was upon the death of Richard L.

Speculation arose that Greater Media would sell off 99.5 [[WKLB-FM]], as its Andover transmitter location provided poor overall coverage of the Boston market, in contrast to the company's other stations. These thoughts were confirmed on July 31, 2006, when Greater Media announced that it would sell the physical property of WKLB-FM and the intellectual property of WCRB to [[Nassau Broadcasting]], thus saving the commercial classical format for the Boston area, albeit on a station with poorer coverage of Boston. At the same time, Greater Media announced that the country format and intellectual property of WKLB would relocate to the prime signal of 102.5 MHz. WCRB's transition from 102.5 to 99.5 was completed on December 1, 2006 at noon local time. The first selection broadcast on the new frequency was the [[Hallelujah Chorus]] from Handel's ''Messiah''.\n\n[[File:WCRB-FM 99-5 2009 radio logo.png|thumb|right|Logo as \"99.5 All Classical\" from December 2009 to October 2011]]\nIt was announced on September 21, 2009 that the [[WGBH Educational Foundation]] would acquire WCRB from Nassau and convert the station to non-commercial operation, complementing sister station [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]].<ref name=\"wgbh-buyswcrb\">{{cite press release|title=Public media leader WGBH to acquire WCRB Radio|publisher=[[WGBH (FM)|WGBH Boston]]|date=September 21, 2009|url=http://www.wgbh.org/fck/userfiles/file/WGBH_WCRB_News.pdf|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}</ref> The sale was completed on December 1, 2009.

In 1982, WSSH evolved to a soft AC format gradually eliminating the instrumental renditions and became home to popular nighttime radio personality [[Delilah Rene]] before she became nationally syndicated. Ratings were very high through the 1980s and WSSH often led other AC stations.  By then, the station was separated from WLLH, but later gained a sister station on 1510 (now [[WMEX (AM)|WMEX]]). WSSH had high ratings and was often the top-rated adult contemporary radio station in the market throughout the 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the early 1990s, ratings went from excellent to mediocre; part of the reason was the perception that WSSH was still an [[elevator music]] station. By 1991, the station modified its format to mainstream AC by adding current product and some up-tempo AC tunes. WSSH became the third place radio station, following [[WMJX]] and [[WROR-FM|WVBF]] (now known as WROR, which subsequently became a sister station to 99.5). On December 13, 1995, the owner of WSSH, Granum Communications, changed the format to [[smooth jazz]], under the branding of '''WOAZ''' (''99.5 The Oasis''), mirroring Granum's [[KMVK|KOAI]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290762572.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+21%2C+1995&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=79&desc=Jazzy+WOAZ+whisks+mellow+WSSH+away Jazzy WOAZ whisks mellow WSSH away<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-12-15.pdf (p. 3)]</ref>\n\nThen, in 1997, Granum sold WOAZ and [[WBOS]] to [[Greater Media]], which already owned WMJX, WBCS (the incarnation of WKLB at that time) and [[WROR]] (the former WVBF and WCLB). On August 22 of that year, Greater Media swapped the frequencies of WOAZ and WKLB in a move where the format and personalities of WOAZ moved to 96.9 (adopting the call sign [[WBQT (FM)|WSJZ]]), while WKLB moved to 99.5 and became ''Country 99.5 WKLB'', where it stayed until December 1, 2006. Greater Media noted that the move was made because the 99.5 signal is stronger than that of 96.9 in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], home to many country music listeners.\n\nThe 99.5 frequency was spun off to [[Nassau Broadcasting Partners]] as a consequence of a deal where Greater Media acquired WCRB's current frequency, with 102.5 adopting the WKLB format and call sign. Nassau also acquired WCRB's call letters and programming.  Nassau already owned four classical-formatted stations in Maine affiliated with the [[World Classical Network]]. The two stations switched frequencies at noon on December 1, 2006.<ref name=\"Ticker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/11/30/its_time_for_klb_crb_fans_to_change_presets/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Clea|last=Simon|date=November 30, 2006|page=E6|title=It's time for 'KLB, 'CRB fans to change presets|accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> The last broadcast by WKLB on 99.5 was of the U.S. National Anthem.

The last air personality on 99.5, and consequently the first live voice on 102.5, was longtime midday host Carolyn Kruse. A redesigned website was launched immediately after the frequency change.\n\n==Audience==\nWCRB claimed to have about 500,000 listeners who tune into the live [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasts and the station's other programming, a longtime claim by management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} According to [[Arbitron]], the Metropolitan Boston market contains 3.8 million individuals 12 years of age or older.{{When|date=March 2012}} An FM station of WCRB's power transmitting on 102.5&nbsp;MHz could reach parts of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; and Southeastern New Hampshire. One could reasonably assume that such coverage adds one-half million individuals,{{Quantify|date=March 2012}} for a total of 4.3 million. If the WCRB programming did in fact reach half a million people, it would generate a rating of close to 12 per cent of the market.

H. Scott, Inc.]]\n\n===WCRB and the 1965 blackout===\nThe solutions developed by WCRB were not just about getting high fidelity audio from remote locations to the studio. Often they involved solutions to problems that nobody anticipated. On November 9, 1965, the northeastern US experienced a [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|massive power blackout]]. WCRB had a backup power generator at its Waltham studios and also at its Needham FM transmitter site. Within a few minutes of the power failure, WCRB was back on the air. At first, nobody knew how long the power failure would last, or its extent.\n\nSoon reports came into the station that showed the widespread extent of the blackout. WCRB engineering checked the amount of diesel fuel remaining and found that it might not last more than a few more hours. The fuel vendor was notified, but there was no fuel available. A radio engineer started driving around and discovered that [[Civil Defense]] was trying to get a portable generator running which they had connected to the Waltham Hospital (since renamed). The hospital had no power, and the only generator available would not run. WCRB\u2019s station engineer suggested that the electric company back-feed power from WCRB to the hospital, using the existing distribution lines but disconnecting everybody else. The hospital was on Hope Avenue, off South Street, on the other side of [[Brandeis University]]. WCRB successfully fed power to the hospital, and the fuel from the inoperative generator was transferred to WCRB\u2019s tank. Within a few hours, WCRB had its fuel tank filled from additional donations. To have enough power available to supply the hospital, it became necessary to shut down the AM transmitter.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Translators==\n{{RadioTranslators\n| callsign = WCRB\n| width    =\n| call1    = W242AA\n| freq1    = 96.3\n| fid1     = 72093\n| watts1   = 5\n| haat1    = 80\n| class1   = D\n| city1    = Beacon Hill, Massachusetts\n| coord1   = {{coord|42|21|43.2|N|71|5|2.4|W|region:US-MA_type:landmark|name=W242AA}}\n| notes1   = \n}}\n\nWCRB was formerly carried on a separately-owned translator in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], W295BL (106.9); this ended after the translator was sold by Basic Holdings to Saga Communications in September 2019.<ref>[https://www.rbr.com/just-your-basic-translator-sale-to-saga/ RBR.com]</ref><ref>[https://news.radio-online.com/articles/b16010/Saga-Agrees-to-Acquire-FM-Translator-in-Manchester-NH news.radio-online.com]</ref> In January 2020, W295BL began carrying the third HD Radio channel of Saga-owned [[WZID]].<ref name=\"ri-wzidhd3onw269bl\">{{cite news |last1=Venta |first1=Lance |title=Double The Outlaw In New Hampshire |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/182971/double-the-outlaw-in-new-hampshire/ |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |work=RadioInsight |date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://www.classicalwcrb.org/}}\n*{{FM station data|WCRB}}\n\n'''Translator data'''\n*{{FMQ|W242AA}}\n*{{FXL|W242AA}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Radio Stations\n| list  =\n{{Boston Radio}}\n{{Cape Cod Radio}}\n}}\n{{WGBH}}\n{{NPR Massachusetts}}\n{{Classical Radio Stations in Massachusetts}}\n\n[[Category:NPR member stations]]\n[[Category:Classical music radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Lowell, Massachusetts|CRB]]\n[[Category:Media in Middlesex County, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:WGBH Educational Foundation]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Massachusetts]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWCRB and the 1965 blackout", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCRB"}

The majority of the clergy, siding with the Metropolitan, opted to strengthen the new Metropolia's bonds with their sister churches throughout the world. A minority, however, began dealing with the patriarchate in secret from the Metropolitan, revealing their change in affiliation after it occurred. Upon early discovery, a provisional statement was released for signature for future incoming clergy rejecting ecumenism and modernism. It is debated between parties for and against such union as to whether the open publication of the document halted the schism in the Metropolia or accelerated it.<ref>http://morespaciousthantheheavens.blogspot.com/2012/05/sinking-ship-of-milan-synod.html</ref>\n\n===Relations with other jurisdictions===\n\nThe Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles was created by order of the [[Holy Synod of Milan]] on February 27, 2011.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/50316494/original-tomos0001</ref> A complicating factor to the issuance of said Tomos was the issuance of a Tomos giving jurisdiction over South America to [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America|Archbishop Chrysostomos of Ecuador]], a Bishop of the True Orthodox Church of Metropolitan Anghelos, five months before with Metropolitan Evloghios' signature on it.<ref>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SrG-6w3hn1M/TeRx1_7ka0I/AAAAAAAAAFw/V6r2S1MMeRI/s1600/Elevaci%25C3%25B3nMetropolitaweb.JPG</ref> This has led to jurisdictional overlap between the two Synods, though in practice such overlap has involved only a few clergy or missions.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia formally recognized that, for the present, communion with the Holy Synod of Milan had been broken by the latter and reaffirmed its communion with the other True Orthodox churches in communion with the American Metropolia.\n\nOn August 24, 2012 (New Style), Metropolitan John recognized the rights of Archbishop Onufrie of Bergamo, a Bishop of the Milan Synod who had separated from the Milan Synod with four parishes in Italy and Spain, as the legitimate head of the Synod in Italy<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tomos10.pdf</ref> and he was given the rank and title granted to Metropolitan Evloghios of Milan. Due to internal issues within the existing communion, however, formal recognition was never realized. In October 2013, Metropolitan Onufrie issued a Tomos to [http://en.orthodoxwiki.org/Nicholas_(Iuhos) Metropolitan Nicholas (Iuhos)] of Cincinnati (formerly of the ROCOR-V) to self-govern;<ref>http://www.tocamerica.org/assets/Tomos-of-Autonomy-2013.jpg</ref> this recognition was never recognized as valid by the Metropolia and estranged the two Synods.\n\nIn March 2014, due to negotiations with a splinter group of the [[Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church]], Metropolitan Raphael of Moscow issued letters defending the condemned heresy of [[Imyaslavie]],<ref>http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/?act=news&id=107824</ref> to which the Bishops of the Metropolia, in the person of Metropolitan John, issued a series of denunciations, with a final determination to be held at the Synod meeting in 2014. The Synod of Metropolitan Anghelos refused to condemn Imyaslavie as a heresy, referring to it only as a \"theologumenon\".\n\nOn December 18, 2014 (NS) The Synod formally anathematized Imyaslavie,<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/synodal-anathema-name-worship-imiaslavie-heresy/</ref> and considered communion between the Metropolia and the Synod of Metropolitan Raphael de facto broken, and by extension, the Synod of Metropolitan Anghelos, until such time as terminology defending Imyaslavie was formally rejected.\n\nOn June 16, 2018 the Synod published a Statement on Communion with Sister Synods, citing its re-affirmation of full communion with Greece and Russia and announcing establishment of The International Union of Genuine Orthodox Churches.<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/2018/06/16/statement-on-communion-with-sister-synods/</ref>\n\n===Expansion in Canada===\n[[File:Allsaintsc.png|thumbnail|left|All Saints Orthodox Cathedral, Edmonton, AB]]\nWith the reception of Bishop Joseph (Royer) of Edmonton by the Synod, a number of parishes which had become disaffected with the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada|Ukrainian Orthodox Consistory]]'s pastoral care applied to join and were accepted into the Archdiocese in 2013, leading the consistory to threaten legal action against the parishes (but not direct engagement against the Bishop) to take their buildings away. While some parishes were able to appeal to their right to the parish buildings in civil court, others have been threatened with legal action by the consistory, and are forming missions independently of their historic temples.<ref>http://orthodoxarchdiocese.ca/parishes/</ref>\n\nThe Synod named the bishop to the rank of Archbishop of Edmonton and Canada in 2014,<ref>http://orthodoxarchdiocese.ca/diocese-of-edmonton/</ref> with an enthronement scheduled during the biennial meeting of the Synod of Bishops in 2014.\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Historical relations to other Old Calendarists===\nCritics have pointed to the fact that the American Metropolia lacks a similar historical succession to the True Orthodox Churches of Greece or Russia, although its defenders have pointed out that their hierarchy was regularized by the Synod of Milan in 1997, which had been recognized by at least some True Orthodox Greek jurisdictions as their own at the time and to the present day.\n\nIn addition, critics question the Synod's historical connection to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|UAOC]], which are generally not considered part of the True Orthodox Church or Old Calendarists by same but criticized as a largely ethnocentric movement. This, combined with a tendency on the part of the bishops towards not taking sides in jurisdictional disputes, has led to some critics to claim that the Metropolia advocates a form of \"jurisdictional ecumenism\",<ref>http://remnantrocor.blogspot.com/2011/02/jurisdictional-ecumenism.html</ref> though clergy of the Metropolia reject such a designation.\n\nThe Metropolia has a committee for Inter-Orthodox Relations, composed of a priest and two deacons acting under the purview of the Metropolitan.<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/formation-of-commission-for-inter-orthodox-and-external-relations/</ref> To date, the committee has sent one series of letters after a public invitation to dialogue of the bishops of the former [[Orthodox Church of Greece (Holy Synod in Resistance)|Synod in Resistance]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/appeal-commission-inter-orthodox-extenal-church-relations-synod-resistance/</ref> Although initially rebuffed,<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/reply-synod-resistance/</ref> the clergy asked a series of questions concerning the [[ecclesiology]] of the Synod on matters of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in [[Orthodox Church|World Orthodoxy]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/november-821-letter-synod-resistance/</ref> The answers to these questions later inadvertently formed the basis for resolution of division between the True Orthodox Church of Greece (Abp Kallinikos) and the Synod in Resistance, leading to the Synod in Resistance's reception into the GOC in 2014,<ref>http://hsir.org/pdfs/2014/10/01/E20141001aSynodikesTheseis-Antidrontes%20Folder/E20141001aSynodikesTheseis-Antidrontes.pdf</ref> though no official response on those questions was sent to the committee, which has remained largely inactive since.\n\n===Western rites===\nThe Metropolia has also been criticized for the public use of [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rites]] among some of its American clergy, which are generally regarded with suspicion among True Orthodox,<ref>http://symeon-anthony.info/WesternOrthodoxRite/A%20Western%20Orthodox%20Rite.htm</ref> although private use of such prayers are sometimes permitted throughout True Orthodoxy. Defenders have responded that the Metropolia has done sufficient work to ensure that its prayers fall within the pre-schism Western Tradition of the Church, having researched and translated pre-schism texts from the Latin for nearly four decades, and having gone so far as to openly critique Western Rites used in the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]] and the [[Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AN-OPEN-LETTER-TO-THE-CLERGY-AND-LAITY-OF-THE-ROCOR-WESTERN-RITE.pdf</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n* Metropolitan John, Archbishop of New York and First-Hierarch of the Holy Synod\n* Archbishop Philip of Philadelphia (ret.)\n* Bishop Christodoulos of Miami and Santiago\n* Bishop Alexios of Hazleton and Weatherly\n* Bishop Sava of Caracas and Venezuela\n*James, Bishop of Whithorn, Dumfries and the Marches <ref>'''True Orthodox Metropolia of North & South America & British Isles is on''' </ref>\n\n==Former bishops==\n\n*Archbishop Joseph of Edmonton and Canada\n* Archbishop Hilarion of Texas *''Transfer.''

It is debated between parties for and against such union as to whether the open publication of the document halted the schism in the Metropolia or accelerated it.<ref>http://morespaciousthantheheavens.blogspot.com/2012/05/sinking-ship-of-milan-synod.html</ref>\n\n===Relations with other jurisdictions===\n\nThe Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles was created by order of the [[Holy Synod of Milan]] on February 27, 2011.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/50316494/original-tomos0001</ref> A complicating factor to the issuance of said Tomos was the issuance of a Tomos giving jurisdiction over South America to [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America|Archbishop Chrysostomos of Ecuador]], a Bishop of the True Orthodox Church of Metropolitan Anghelos, five months before with Metropolitan Evloghios' signature on it.<ref>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SrG-6w3hn1M/TeRx1_7ka0I/AAAAAAAAAFw/V6r2S1MMeRI/s1600/Elevaci%25C3%25B3nMetropolitaweb.JPG</ref> This has led to jurisdictional overlap between the two Synods, though in practice such overlap has involved only a few clergy or missions.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia formally recognized that, for the present, communion with the Holy Synod of Milan had been broken by the latter and reaffirmed its communion with the other True Orthodox churches in communion with the American Metropolia.\n\nOn August 24, 2012 (New Style), Metropolitan John recognized the rights of Archbishop Onufrie of Bergamo, a Bishop of the Milan Synod who had separated from the Milan Synod with four parishes in Italy and Spain, as the legitimate head of the Synod in Italy<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tomos10.pdf</ref> and he was given the rank and title granted to Metropolitan Evloghios of Milan. Due to internal issues within the existing communion, however, formal recognition was never realized. In October 2013, Metropolitan Onufrie issued a Tomos to [http://en.orthodoxwiki.org/Nicholas_(Iuhos) Metropolitan Nicholas (Iuhos)] of Cincinnati (formerly of the ROCOR-V) to self-govern;<ref>http://www.tocamerica.org/assets/Tomos-of-Autonomy-2013.jpg</ref> this recognition was never recognized as valid by the Metropolia and estranged the two Synods.\n\nIn March 2014, due to negotiations with a splinter group of the [[Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church]], Metropolitan Raphael of Moscow issued letters defending the condemned heresy of [[Imyaslavie]],<ref>http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/?act=news&id=107824</ref> to which the Bishops of the Metropolia, in the person of Metropolitan John, issued a series of denunciations, with a final determination to be held at the Synod meeting in 2014. The Synod of Metropolitan Anghelos refused to condemn Imyaslavie as a heresy, referring to it only as a \"theologumenon\".\n\nOn December 18, 2014 (NS) The Synod formally anathematized Imyaslavie,<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/synodal-anathema-name-worship-imiaslavie-heresy/</ref> and considered communion between the Metropolia and the Synod of Metropolitan Raphael de facto broken, and by extension, the Synod of Metropolitan Anghelos, until such time as terminology defending Imyaslavie was formally rejected.\n\nOn June 16, 2018 the Synod published a Statement on Communion with Sister Synods, citing its re-affirmation of full communion with Greece and Russia and announcing establishment of The International Union of Genuine Orthodox Churches.<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/2018/06/16/statement-on-communion-with-sister-synods/</ref>\n\n===Expansion in Canada===\n[[File:Allsaintsc.png|thumbnail|left|All Saints Orthodox Cathedral, Edmonton, AB]]\nWith the reception of Bishop Joseph (Royer) of Edmonton by the Synod, a number of parishes which had become disaffected with the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada|Ukrainian Orthodox Consistory]]'s pastoral care applied to join and were accepted into the Archdiocese in 2013, leading the consistory to threaten legal action against the parishes (but not direct engagement against the Bishop) to take their buildings away. While some parishes were able to appeal to their right to the parish buildings in civil court, others have been threatened with legal action by the consistory, and are forming missions independently of their historic temples.<ref>http://orthodoxarchdiocese.ca/parishes/</ref>\n\nThe Synod named the bishop to the rank of Archbishop of Edmonton and Canada in 2014,<ref>http://orthodoxarchdiocese.ca/diocese-of-edmonton/</ref> with an enthronement scheduled during the biennial meeting of the Synod of Bishops in 2014.\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Historical relations to other Old Calendarists===\nCritics have pointed to the fact that the American Metropolia lacks a similar historical succession to the True Orthodox Churches of Greece or Russia, although its defenders have pointed out that their hierarchy was regularized by the Synod of Milan in 1997, which had been recognized by at least some True Orthodox Greek jurisdictions as their own at the time and to the present day.\n\nIn addition, critics question the Synod's historical connection to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|UAOC]], which are generally not considered part of the True Orthodox Church or Old Calendarists by same but criticized as a largely ethnocentric movement. This, combined with a tendency on the part of the bishops towards not taking sides in jurisdictional disputes, has led to some critics to claim that the Metropolia advocates a form of \"jurisdictional ecumenism\",<ref>http://remnantrocor.blogspot.com/2011/02/jurisdictional-ecumenism.html</ref> though clergy of the Metropolia reject such a designation.\n\nThe Metropolia has a committee for Inter-Orthodox Relations, composed of a priest and two deacons acting under the purview of the Metropolitan.<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/formation-of-commission-for-inter-orthodox-and-external-relations/</ref> To date, the committee has sent one series of letters after a public invitation to dialogue of the bishops of the former [[Orthodox Church of Greece (Holy Synod in Resistance)|Synod in Resistance]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/appeal-commission-inter-orthodox-extenal-church-relations-synod-resistance/</ref> Although initially rebuffed,<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/reply-synod-resistance/</ref> the clergy asked a series of questions concerning the [[ecclesiology]] of the Synod on matters of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in [[Orthodox Church|World Orthodoxy]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/november-821-letter-synod-resistance/</ref> The answers to these questions later inadvertently formed the basis for resolution of division between the True Orthodox Church of Greece (Abp Kallinikos) and the Synod in Resistance, leading to the Synod in Resistance's reception into the GOC in 2014,<ref>http://hsir.org/pdfs/2014/10/01/E20141001aSynodikesTheseis-Antidrontes%20Folder/E20141001aSynodikesTheseis-Antidrontes.pdf</ref> though no official response on those questions was sent to the committee, which has remained largely inactive since.\n\n===Western rites===\nThe Metropolia has also been criticized for the public use of [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rites]] among some of its American clergy, which are generally regarded with suspicion among True Orthodox,<ref>http://symeon-anthony.info/WesternOrthodoxRite/A%20Western%20Orthodox%20Rite.htm</ref> although private use of such prayers are sometimes permitted throughout True Orthodoxy. Defenders have responded that the Metropolia has done sufficient work to ensure that its prayers fall within the pre-schism Western Tradition of the Church, having researched and translated pre-schism texts from the Latin for nearly four decades, and having gone so far as to openly critique Western Rites used in the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]] and the [[Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate]].<ref>http://orthodoxmetropolia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AN-OPEN-LETTER-TO-THE-CLERGY-AND-LAITY-OF-THE-ROCOR-WESTERN-RITE.pdf</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n* Metropolitan John, Archbishop of New York and First-Hierarch of the Holy Synod\n* Archbishop Philip of Philadelphia (ret.)\n* Bishop Christodoulos of Miami and Santiago\n* Bishop Alexios of Hazleton and Weatherly\n* Bishop Sava of Caracas and Venezuela\n*James, Bishop of Whithorn, Dumfries and the Marches <ref>'''True Orthodox Metropolia of North & South America & British Isles is on''' </ref>\n\n==Former bishops==\n\n*Archbishop Joseph of Edmonton and Canada\n* Archbishop Hilarion of Texas *''Transfer.''

The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.&nbsp;W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

He found the series particularly unfair to Baskin, pointing that in focusing on her husband's disappearance so much it failed to distinguish her from Exotic and Antle, barely mentioning that Big Cat Rescue only accepts tigers confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who could no longer handle them, owners who had to sign a contract with heavy financial penalties if they owned another big cat or were even photographed with one, a proviso not mentioned in the series. Baskin also forbids volunteers or staff from touching the animals; they are fired for doing so, Frick-Wright wrote. The series also minimized Baskin's efforts to lobby Congress for stricter legislation on animal trafficking.<ref name=\"Outside piece\">{{cite magazine|last=Frick-Wright|first=Peter|title='Tiger King' Is a Wild Ride.

such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|section|date=April 2020}}\nThe series focuses on the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, exploring the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.&nbsp;W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

Maybe Baskin did kill her husband\u2014and the third episode of the series is devoted to the evidence pointing to this conclusion\u2014but so far there is little more than speculation to say that she did. Meanwhile, the series shows clips from Exotic\u2019s erstwhile YouTube series in which he poses alongside a blow-up doll, Baskin in [[effigy]], shoving a dildo into its mouth and shooting it in the head.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elle.com.au/culture/tiger-king-facts-memes-23290|title='Tiger King' Is Worth Talking About, But The Conversation We're Having Is All Wrong|last=Wahi|first=Sukriti|date=April 7, 2020|website=[[Elle]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] noted that Baskin was portrayed as hypocritical for keeping the tigers in captivity instead of releasing them without explaining that doing so was not an option\u2014being captive-bred from mixed stock, as well as in-effect [[Domestication|domesticated]], meant they were unsuited to either survive in the wild or rebuild regional populations.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''Elle'' also noted that Baskin was the only source in the series explaining why keeping the wild animals was abusive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n\"Goode brings to ''Tiger King'' the intellectual rigor and social responsibility of ... a nightclub and hotel developer\", Peter Frick-Wright, who had produced ''Cat People'', a podcast series covering the American big-cat industry, wrote in ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]''. He found the series particularly unfair to Baskin, pointing that in focusing on her husband's disappearance so much it failed to distinguish her from Exotic and Antle, barely mentioning that Big Cat Rescue only accepts tigers confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who could no longer handle them, owners who had to sign a contract with heavy financial penalties if they owned another big cat or were even photographed with one, a proviso not mentioned in the series. Baskin also forbids volunteers or staff from touching the animals; they are fired for doing so, Frick-Wright wrote. The series also minimized Baskin's efforts to lobby Congress for stricter legislation on animal trafficking.<ref name=\"Outside piece\">{{cite magazine|last=Frick-Wright|first=Peter|title='Tiger King' Is a Wild Ride.
