Cortez is also known for his role as an [[LGBT rights activist]], and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention work.\n\n[[Category:1998 births]]\n\n== Early years ==\nCortez was born in the agricultural town of [[San Juan Bautista, California]] to working class parents. At eight years old he moved to [[Watsonville, California]]. He is the second of three children with two sisters.\n\nCortez was first introduced to the arts in elementary school but did not take his first formal art class until he was in seventh grade. During this time, Cortez describes his early passion for drawing as a way to cope with feeling like an outsider at school. As a self-proclaimed nerd, Cortez recalls this time as when \"nerds were nerds, unlike now, when nerd is a code word for cool.\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.artpractical.com/feature/in_the_artists_studio_part_3_jaime_cortez/|title=Inside the Artist's Studio, Part 3: Jaime Cortez {{!}} Art Practical|last=Patricia|work=Art Practical|access-date=2017-04-27}}</ref> Cortez further recalls that his love of drawing at an early age lead him to steal money from his mother's purse to buy a drawing pad.<ref name=\":0\"/> He filled this drawing pad with comic book imagery, and imitations of advertisements for beauty salon's.\n\nHe moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1993 and lived there for ten years among the city's queer Latino artistic community.\n\n== Education ==\nCortez attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Communications and minor in English in 1987. He was the first in his family to graduate from college. Due to what Cortez describes as \"working-class issues\", at this period in time he felt that studying art would be a frivolous subject matter.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nLater in his life after establishing his career in the arts, Cortez attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he pursued his Master's of Fine Arts (Art Practice), graduating in 2006.\n\n== HIV/AIDS prevention activism ==\nFollowing his completion of college, Cortez spent two years teaching English at the Ichikawa High School in Yamanashi Ken, Japan.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, an ill Cortez sought medical treatment for [[ulcerative colitis]], and while at the doctor was asked about his sexual history by a nurse. In an interview with ''[[ColorLines]]'' Cortez recalls \"The moment I told her I was gay,\" he said, \"she literally took her hands off me.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.colorlines.com/articles/graphic-novels-heal|title=Graphic Novels That Heal|last=cl_admin|date=2009-01-06|work=Colorlines|access-date=2017-04-27}}</ref> Thus, he witnessed firsthand the fear, confusion, and biases toward HIV/AIDS patients. Following this incident, Cortez became an HIV/AIDS prevention activist. From 1993 to 1995 he was Assistant to the Director of the [[Gay and lesbian medical association|Gay and Lesbian Medical Associatio]]<nowiki/>n and the Education Coordinator for the [[The NAMES Project Foundation|NAMES Project Foundation]] /[[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|AIDS Memorial Quilt]] from 1995 to 1997. Additionally, Cortez organized discussion groups for gay men to create a community and talk about issues, such as dating across [[HIV]] status.\n\n== Notable works ==\nCortez has worked in various mediums of art production and teaching throughout his career.\n\n=== ''Sexilo'' / ''Sexile'' ===\nAs part of his HIV/AIDS prevention work, Cortez wrote and illustrated ''Sexile/Sexilo'', a bilingual graphic novel that depicts the true life story of [[Adela V\u00e1zquez|Adela Vasquez]], a Cuban transgender immigrant who arrives to the United States and explores her sexuality, gender and identity among a vibrant but dangerous time in queer communities.<ref>De la Garza Valenzuela, Jos\u00e9. \"IMPOSSIBLY HERE, IMPOSSIBLY QUEER:\n\nCITIZENSHIP,  SEXUALITY, AND GAY CHICANO FICTION .\" Electronic Thesis\n\nor Dissertation.

Impressed by her story, Cortez contacted Vasquez one year later about having her become the subject  of his new graphic novel. Working with [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]], Cortez created this graphic novel as an HIV prevention publication that would exhibit the gay and/or transgender lifestyle as unapologetic. Cortez credits the word Sexile to Puerto Rican academic [[Manolo Guzman]]. It defines the state of people who have been cast out from their culture and families. On why he felt this was an import story to be told Cortez says \"Not just because I'm a queer, a child of immigrants, or a lover of both comics and sexual narratives, but because this story is so fucked up, fabulous, raggedy and human that it opens a vast space where we can all ponder our own sense of risk, exile and home.\" <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Sexile|last=Cortez|first=Jaime|publisher=Institute for Gay Men's Health|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==== Reception ====\nSexile has been positively received in the LGBTQ community.

Images from Sexile are published in ''[[No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics]]'' by Justin Hall who refers to the work as art \"made during the [HIV/AIDS] plague\". \"LGBTQ cartoonists' responses to this holocaust were varied...

The song is a multi-lingual French-English power ballad and like France's previous internal selections in 2016 and 2017, the verses are in French and the chorus is in English. After receiving more than one hundred songs written, the TV network convened several listening committees to pick the best entry. Everyone agreed on the chosen song, with some describing it as love at first listen. Three of the main selection criteria were universality, emotion and capacity of the song to make the audience \"live an experience\". The listening committee included professionals from the music industry and France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision members. The delegation previously testified how magical the moment was when the artist and song first came together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2020/02/16/france-tom-leeb-the-best-in-me-eurovision-2020/250034/|title=France: Tom Leeb will sing \"The Best in Me\" at Eurovision 2020|date=16 February 2020|website=wiwibloggs|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe song was debuted live at an event at the Eiffel Tower in Paris on 16 February 2020.\n\n==Eurovision Song Contest==\n{{Main|France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020}}\nThe song would have represented [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020]], after [[Tom Leeb]] was internally selected by the national broadcaster [[France 2]].

The song is a multi-lingual French-English power ballad and like France's previous internal selections in 2016 and 2017, the verses are in French and the chorus is in English. After receiving more than one hundred songs written, the TV network convened several listening committees to pick the best entry. Everyone agreed on the chosen song, with some describing it as love at first listen. Three of the main selection criteria were universality, emotion and capacity of the song to make the audience \"live an experience\". The listening committee included professionals from the music industry and France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision members.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch.3, \"The Ring Goes South\"</ref> In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch. 4, \"A Journey in the Dark\"</ref> They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]].<ref group=T>\"[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] book 2, ch. 5, \"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\"</ref> Aragorn leads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\n\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\n\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' book 6, ch. 7, \"Homeward Bound\"</ref> They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 8, \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\"</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' book 6, ch. 9, \"The Grey Havens\"</ref>\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dreme<!--sic-->''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In drafts of the final chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings'' published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>Tolkien, Christopher.

In ''The Return of the King'' he is also called ''Daur'', Sindarin for \"noble\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In a letter Tolkien states that it is the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', connected to ''[[Germanic name#Frod|fr\u00f3d]]'', \"wise by experience\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #168</ref> The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} Instead, he notes, the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' is mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as the minor character ''Fr\u00f3da''. ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', describes Frodo's character as combining \"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\",{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}} attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch.3, \"The Ring Goes South\"</ref> In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch. 4, \"A Journey in the Dark\"</ref> They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]].<ref group=T>\"[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] book 2, ch. 5, \"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\"</ref> Aragorn leads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\n\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\n\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' book 6, ch. 7, \"Homeward Bound\"</ref> They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 8, \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\"</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' book 6, ch. 9, \"The Grey Havens\"</ref>\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dreme<!--sic-->''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In a letter Tolkien states that it is the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', connected to ''[[Germanic name#Frod|fr\u00f3d]]'', \"wise by experience\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #168</ref> The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} Instead, he notes, the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' is mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as the minor character ''Fr\u00f3da''. ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R.

She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.<ref name=art01 />\n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=je>{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|260px|Esther talking to Mordecai]]\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.<ref name=art01 />\n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=je>{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|260px|Esther talking to Mordecai]]\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

These developments resulted in Britain becoming the premier economies in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy and a major political entity. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. Britons pioneered the [[railway]] system and built many systems and sold most of the equipment other nations used.  Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. The markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding [[British Empire]]. After 1840, an economic policy of [[mercantilism]] was abandoned and replaced by \"free trade,\" with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions. The powerful [[Royal Navy]] protected British interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system provided a system for resolving disputes relatively inexpensively, and the [[City of London]] functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1900, [[Income per capita|economic output per head]] of the UK population rose by 50 percent (from about \u00a328 per capita to \u00a341 in 1900: an annual average increase in real incomes of 1% p.a.), growth which was associated with a significant rise in [[living standards]].<ref>Charles H. Feinstein (1972) ''National Income, Expenditure and Output of the United Kingdom. 1855-1955. Studies in the National Income and Expenditure of the United Kingdom, 6.''

In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by [[Economic history of Australia|Australia]]. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by [[Economic History of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 percent above of the six founder members of the [[EEC]], but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies. <ref>Lee, Clive. ''The British economy since 1700: a macroeconomic perspective'' (1986)</ref> \n\nThe response of successive British governments to this problematic performance was to seek economic growth stimuli within what became the [[European Union]]; Britain entered the [[European Community]] in 1973. Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the 2007 crisis, British income  per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of [[Economic history of France|France]] and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA. This period also saw high rates of economic growth in the [[Pacific Basin]] with, first, [[economic history of Japan|Japan]] and then [[Economic history of South Korea|South Korea]] emerging as major economies as globalisation produced widespread economic development in the [[world economy]]. <ref name=\"Crafts\">{{cite book|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|title=Britain's Relative Economic Performance, 1870\u20131999|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|location=London|isbn=978-0-255-36524-6|year=1966}}</ref>\n\n==16th\u201317th centuries==\n[[File:Arms of Owen Tudor.svg|thumb|150px|Ancient coat of arms of the Tudor family.]]\nDuring 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred, these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation. After 1600, the North Sea region took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean, which prior to this date, particularly in [[northern Italy]], had been the most highly developed part of Europe. Great Britain, together with the [[Low Countries]], profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The export of woollen products resulted in an economic upturn with products exported to mainland Europe. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] negotiated the favourable [[Intercursus Magnus]] treaty in 1496.<ref>David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547-1603'' p. 300.</ref>\n\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were temporary. When the population recovered, low wages and a land shortage returned.  Historians in the early 20th century characterized the economic in terms of general decline, manorial reorganization, and agricultural contraction. Later historians dropped those themes and stressed the transitions between medieval forms and Tudor progress.<ref>Michael Postan, \"Revisions in Economic History.

He found other towns in decline, and suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper.<ref>John S.

The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.<ref>[[Derek Hirst]], \"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\" ''History'' (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24423269 online]</ref>\n\n===Growth in money supply===\nSpanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World exported large quantities of silver and gold to Europe, some of which added to the English money supply. There were multiple results that all helped expand and grow the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester.  The key features of the growth pattern included specialization and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of  promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by hard specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities  to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new upscale market demands. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.<ref>N. Palma, \"Money and modernization in early modern England\" ''Financial History Review'' (2019), [http://www.ehes.org/EHES_147.pdf preprint EHES Working Paper No. 147, February 2019, online]</ref>\n\nVarious inflationary pressures existed; some were due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population. Inflation had a negative effect on the real wealth of most families.<ref>J. R. Wordie, \"Deflationary factors in the Tudor price rise.\" ''Past & Present'' 154 (1997): 32-70.</ref> It set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening.

Mostly privately-owned companies traded with the colonies in the West Indies, Northern America and India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen [[broadcloth]].  This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.<ref>Robert Brenner, ''Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653'' (Verso, 2003).</ref><ref>E.  Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1956), 2:196-268.</ref>\n\n===Wool industry===\n{{Further|Medieval English wool trade}}\nWoollen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500-1750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England: vol 2: The age of mercantilism'' (7th 1964) pp 10-92.</ref><ref>Peter J.

A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England.  Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back.  However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119-20.</ref>\n\n===Diets===\nThe diet depended largely on social class. The rich ate meat\u2014beef, pork, venison\u2014and white bread, the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat perhaps at Christmas. Everyone drank ale\u2014water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of old salted meat. Vegetables and fruits were not popular. The potato was not part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.<ref>Stephen Mennell, ''All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996).</ref>\n\nAmong the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman.  Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known.\n\nBoth the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in [[scurvy]].\n\nTrade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread distress.<ref>Andrew B. Appleby, ''Famine in Tudor and Stuart England'' (Stanford University Press, 1978).</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do in France.<ref>Andrew B. Appleby, \"Grain prices and subsistence crises in England and France, 1590\u20131740.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 39#4 (1979): 865-887.

By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nWhile the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and Prussia's [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from \u00a36.5 million in 1700, to \u00a314.7 million in 1760 and \u00a343.2 million in 1800.<ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) p 188.</ref>  Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.<ref>Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783-1872'' (1996) p 31.</ref><ref>Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. \"'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals.\" ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419.

Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) pp 184-370 gives capsule histories of 10 major trading companies: The Merchant Adventurers, the East India Company, the Eastland Company, the Russia Company, the Levant Company, the African Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the French Company, the Spanish Company, and the South Sea Company.</ref> However, there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331 million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king.  His chief minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp 334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141\u2013165</ref>\n\n=== The Age of Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding [[English overseas possessions]], which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the [[West Indies]] such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Bermuda]], and of Virginia, one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the [[Maritime provinces]] of what is now Canada.  The sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Great Britain control over what is now eastern Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|page=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants&mdash;and kept others out&mdash;by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The [[Navigation Acts]] of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] united Scotland with England).<ref>Darwin, 2012 p.21-22</ref> Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.<ref>Darwin, 2012 p. 166</ref>\n\nThe government had to fight smuggling&mdash;which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|page=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R.

The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.<ref>H. R.

This phenomenon is known as the \"[[industrial revolution]]\", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.<ref>E. Anthony Wrigley, \"Reconsidering the Industrial Revolution: England and Wales.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 49.01 (2018): 9-42.</ref>\n\nEconomic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamental power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]]. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, [[turnpike trusts|improved roads]] and [[Rail transport|railways]]. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.<ref>Redford, Arthur (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBQNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&dq=population+movement+industrial+revolution&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KIP-Tue3BIKV8gPR6LzQBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Labour migration in England, 1800-1850\"], p. 6. Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of [[water wheel]]s and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as [[industrialisation]].\n\nAccording to [[Max Weber]], the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the Puritans of the 17th century.<ref>Hartmut Lehmann and Guenther Roth, eds. ''Weber's Protestant Ethic: Origins, Evidence, Contexts'' (1995)</ref>  This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\" amongst skilled artisans.<ref>Margaret C. Jacob, and Matthew Kadane, \"Missing, Now Found in the Eighteenth Century: Weber's Protestant Capitalist,\" ''American Historical Review,'' (Feb 2003) 108#1 pp 20-49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/533044 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning. [[James Hargreaves]] created the [[Spinning Jenny]], a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the [[water frame]], invented by [[Richard Arkwright]], could be powered by a [[water wheel]]. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the [[factory system]] in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the [[spinning mule]] (a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by [[Samuel Crompton]]. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport.\n\nAs they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as [[New Lanark]] Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the [[domestic system]], in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages.\n\nThe [[steam engine]] was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]], and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by [[James Watt]]; it had a [[reciprocating engine]] capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns.\n\nThe progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the [[North West of England]], though wool remained the chief textile in [[Yorkshire]]. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the [[iron industry]]; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system.\n\nSuch an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of [[mass production]] and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] has posited the 1790s as the \"take-off\" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion.\n\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of [[coal]], the main fuel of the new revolution.\n\nIt was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[capitalism]]. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of [[liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, such as [[Richard Cobden]], [[Joseph Hume]], [[Francis Place]] and [[John Roebuck]].\n\nSome have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British [[slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slave trade and the [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations provided less than 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513025327/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the [[cottage industry]] of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain.\n\n===Empire===\n{{main|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}\nDuring the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.<ref>Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997'' (2010)</ref>  It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. Capitalism encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with [[History of Canada|Canada]], which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and [[History of Australia|Australia]], which followed suit in 1901.<ref>Peter Cain and Tony Hopkins. ''British Imperialism: 1688-2000'' (2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\nCritical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.  With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nMost important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared\u2014it was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.<ref>Roger Wells, \"The revolt of the south-west, 1800-1801: a study in English popular protest,\" ''Social History'' (1977) #6 pp 713-744.</ref>  Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 162-4</ref>\n\nThe system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 143, 162</ref>\n\n[[File:Dette britannique longue p\u00e9riode.png|thumb|The [[national debt]] of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914.]]\nThe British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366 million, including \u00a310 million for the Navy, \u00a340 million for the Army, \u00a310 million for the Allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt.

The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, \"The Impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, on the Long-Run Growth of the British Economy,\" ''Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center'' (1989) 12#3 pp 335-395.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy.

Like that of the years following 1815, the 1840s recession was caused by a series of bad harvests, this time from a blight affecting potatoes facilitated by unusually wet and cold conditions in Northern Europe. Ireland, where the population was heavily dependent on potatoes for subsistence, was the worst affected. On mainland Britain, regions of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Outer Hebrides]] were worst affected by the potato blight (some parts were depopulated by as much as 50%).<ref>{{cite book| title=The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914| author=Richard J.

This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories.  Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system.  In 1815, [[George Stephenson]] invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways ''system'' in 1825 by opening the [[Stockton and Darlington]] line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building\u2014a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. [[Thomas Brassey]] brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model.  Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845\u201347, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of \u00a3200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices.\n[[File:George Hudson - Project Gutenberg eText 17293.jpg|200px|thumb|[[George Hudson]]]]\n\n[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859) designed the first major railway, the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]], built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial [[George Hudson]]. He became Britain's \"railway king\" by merging numerous short lines.<ref>A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, ''George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King'' (2004)</ref>  Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the [[Railway Clearing House]]. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds\u2014paying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.<ref>Adrian Vaughan, ''Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain'' (1997) pp 102-12</ref>\n\n[[File:Euston Station showing wrought iron roof of 1837.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Euston railway station|Euston station in London]], 1837. Note the open passenger carriages]]\n\nBy 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal.  The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.<ref>[[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]] and Gordon Biddle, ''The Oxford Companion to British Railway History: From 1603 to the 1990s'' (1999)</ref>\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution ===\n{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|thumb]]\n[[File:graph rel lvl indz 1750 1900 01.png|thumb]]\nDuring the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers, industrial capitalism gave way to [[financial capitalism]] and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nNew products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with [[steamship]]s, such as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] ''[[SS Great Western]]''. Electricity and [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany.\n\nAmalgamation of industrial [[cartel]]s into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and [[internal combustion engine]]s fuelled by gasoline) were mixed blessings for British business during the late [[Victorian era]]. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &mdash; and falling &mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.\n\nBy the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas &mdash; particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as [[Egypt]]), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the Crystal Palace Speech. At the end of the [[Victorian era]], the [[service sector]] (banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 percent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the Company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned.

One adventurer, [[James Brooke]], set himself up as the Rajah of the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]] in North Borneo in 1842; his realm joined the Empire in 1888. [[Cecil Rhodes]] set up an economic empire of diamonds in South Africa that proved highly profitable.

To protect the canal, Britain expanded further, taking control of Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden, and British Somaliland.  None were especially profitable until the discovery of oil in the Middle East after 1920.  Some military action was involved, and from time to time there was a risk of conflict with other imperial powers seeking the same territory, as in the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898.  All the incidents were resolved peacefully.\n\nCain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873-1879, and was marked above all by price [[deflation]], and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers.

Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high. \n\nBy international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900. \n\nIt has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined.

Among the working class there was a growing demand for access to a greater say in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues only became significant about 1908.

In 1922, for example, the volume of cotton exports was only about half of what it had been in 1913, while coal exports were only one third of their 1913 levels.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.<ref>A.

The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.<ref>R. J.

Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.<ref>Peter Scott and Anna Spadavecchia, \"Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 2011) 64#4 pp 1266-1288</ref> By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter & Mears| year=2011| p=155}}</ref> By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent [[deflation]]ary policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high [[Real wages|real wage]] for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/research/floudjohnsonchaptersep16-03.pdf| title=The British Economy Between the Wars| author=Barry Eichengreen| publisher=eml.berkeley.edu| year=2002| p=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922\u20131923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth. Industrial relations briefly improved, but then came the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street stock market crash]] in October 1929, which sparked the worldwide [[Great Depression]] (See the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|title=Jake Simpkin - Local Historian & Guide > Home|work=jakesimpkin.org|access-date=29 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141229/http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unemployment had stood at less than 1.8 million at the end of 1930, but by the end of 1931 it had risen sharply to more than 2.6 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/24/stock-market-unemployment-1931 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Research | last=Department | title=1931:The spectre of mass unemployment haunts the UK | date=24 May 2011}}</ref> By January 1933, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed, accounting for more than 20% of the workforce - with unemployment topping 50% in some parts of the country, particularly in [[South Wales]] and the north-east of [[England]].

The rate of unemployment fell to 10% in 1938 - half of the level five years previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/unemployment.html|title=A History of Unemployment|work=localhistories.org}}</ref>\n\n===Steel===\nFrom 1800 to 1870, Britain produced more than half of the world's pig iron, and was in the lead in devising ways to make steel. In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, and in 1893 3 million tons; by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.<ref>B. R.

The industry made significant technical advances in terms of vanadium, phospho-magnetic steels and other specialized high-strength alloys, using the electric furnace and other innovations, the devising of new techniques over the smoke issue. The industry trained a cadre of experts that made large firms scientifically self-sustaining.<ref>Michael Sanderson, \"The Professor as Industrial Consultant: Oliver Arnold and the British Steel Industry, 1900-14,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 1978) 31#4 pp 585-600</ref>\n\n===Coal===\nPolitics became a central issue for the coal miners, whose organization was facilitated by their location in remote one-industry villages. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] formed in 1888, and counted 600,000 members in 1908. Much of the 'old left' of Labour politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas.<ref>Vic Allen, ''The militancy of British miners'' (1981).</ref>\n\n====General Strike of 1926====\n{{main|General Strike of 1926}}\nIn April 1926 the owners locked out the miners because they had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices caused by demand as oil started to replace coal.<ref>W.N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England, 1914-1964'' (2nd ed. 1967) pp 223-30</ref> The general strike was led by the TUC for the benefit of coal miners, but it failed.  It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history and TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"The General Strike, 1926,\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001-1012 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638422 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], \"The General Strike,\" ''[[History Today]]'' (2006) 56#5 pp 40-47</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.\n\nCoal continued as a sick industry as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the rest. The Labour government in 1947 nationalized coal into the National Coal Board, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.<ref>Ben Fine, ''The Coal Question: Political Economy and Industrial Change from the Nineteenth Century to the Present Day''  (1990).</ref> By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward.  Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970.  The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911.<ref>B. R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics'' (1975) pp 361-8, 163</ref>\n\n===New Industries===\nWhile Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the [[Import Duties Act 1932]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|issue=5|pages=703\u2013711|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture. Before the First World War, automobile manufacture in Britain had been a boutique industry limited to producing expensive luxury cars. The industry produced 34,000 vehicles for the year 1913; by 1937 over half a million were being produced.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref> Most of these were affordable models like the [[Austin 7]] (introduced 1921), the [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]] (1928), as well as Model A and [[Ford Model Y|Model Y]] cars produced by [[Ford of Britain]]. The adoption of streamlined automation processes and the strong competition between manufacturers was responsible for a 50% drop in motorcar prices between the mid 20s and mid 30s, making cars more affordable (over 1 million were owned by 1930).<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain| author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=541}}</ref>\n\nThe chemicals industry, once dominated by Germany and the United States, also thrived in the UK during the interwar years. By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=157}}</ref> Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the [[Central Electricity Board]] in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed. By 1939 two thirds of homes had electricity supply, which in turn opened up a new consumer market for electrically powered appliances like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, radios and stoves.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1923 and 1938, the most successful new industries were: automobile production, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, metal goods, and printing. These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\">{{cite article| url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000000249| title=Women, Other ''Fresh'' Workers, and the New Manufacturing Workforce of Interwar Britain| publisher=International Review of Social History |volume= 45| year=2000| p=456}}</ref> These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], particularly [[Coventry, England|Coventry]] and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\"/>\n\n===1920s \"consumer boom\"===\nIn spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged \"consumer culture\" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or \"the wireless\" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket.\n\nTourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and [[Skegness]] were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.<ref>Rex Pope, \"A Consumer Service in Interwar Britain: The Hotel Trade, 1924-1938,\" ''Business History Review,'' (Winter 2000) 74#4 pp 657-82</ref>\n\nElectricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s.\n\n===1929\u20131939: the Great Depression===\n{{main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]\nWhile the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall St Crash]] of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s.  Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting [[Tariff Reform]] as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the [[Gold Standard]]. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s. [[Marks & Spencer]], for example, increased its turnover from \u00a32.5 million in 1929 to over \u00a325 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/>\n\nIn 1929 [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed his second minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and the Fascists under [[Oswald Mosley]]. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the Labour Government resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be [[National_Government_(1931)|replaced]] by a McDonald-led [[National_Government_(United_Kingdom)|National Government]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in 1935.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Further|United Kingdom home front during World War II}}\nIn the [[Second World War]], 1939\u201345, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the [[home front]] for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.<ref>Robin Havers, ''The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943'' (2002) Volume 4, p 75</ref>  Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.<ref>W.K. Hancock, W.K. and M. Gowing, ''British War Economy'' (1949)</ref>  The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success.\n\n[[File:London Blitz 791940.jpg|thumb|Smoke billowing from London's [[Surrey Docks]], after a destructive night-time bombing raid by the ''Luftwaffe'' on 7th September 1940.]]\nIndustrial production was reoriented toward munitions, and output soared. In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.<ref>Peter Howlett, \"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44</ref> Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure.  The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940\u2014more than enough to cover the losses\u2014and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.<ref>Postan (1952), Chapter 4.</ref>  Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion<ref>Hancock, ''British War Economy'' [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-Stats-3.html online p 353]</ref>\n\nAfter war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed [[exchange controls]]. The British Government used its [[gold reserves]] and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted [[Lend-Lease]], whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.<ref>There were some exceptions and $650 million was repaid.

Six years of prolonged warfare and heavy losses of merchant shipping meant that Britain had lost two-thirds of her pre-war export trade by 1945.<ref name=\"Lawrence James 1994\">{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1994| p=520}}</ref> The loss of her export markets also caused a serious shortage of US dollars, which were crucial to servicing Britain's war debt and maintaining imports from the United States. Most of Britain's gold and currency reserves were depleted and the Government had been forced to sell off the bulk of British overseas assets to fund the war effort.<ref name=\"Lawrence James 1994\"/> When [[Lend Lease]] was terminated by the United States in August 1945, Britain was unable to pay for the import of essential supplies from America. Although the US agreed to cancel $20 million in Lend Lease debt, the UK was forced to obtain a $3.75 billion loan from the United States at 2% interest in December 1945.<ref>{{cite article| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm| title=What's a Little Debt Between Friends?| author=Finlo Rohrer| publisher=BBC News Magazine| date=2006-05-10| access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref> The US/UK trade imbalance was perilously high, forcing the extension of rationing to lessen the imbalance and preserve precious [[US dollar]]s for the servicing of loan repayments.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2005| p=161}}</ref>\n\nSuccessive governments squandered billions of Marshall Plan Aid to support British world power pretensions, and so jeopardised the economic future of Britain. The Labour government chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like Germany had. \nGermany rebuilt factories like the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. Germany, France and Italy were fully re-engineered with all electric rail lines.  In Britain, steam engines, mechanical semaphore signalling and old track would remain into the 1960s. In addition, the road and telecommunications network in Britain remained equally inadequate, ill-maintained and out-of-date.\n\nBy 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Correlli |title=The Wasting of Britain's Marshall Aid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml |website=BBC History |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], just after the end of the war in Europe, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy. Taxes were increased, industries were nationalised, and the [[welfare state]] with the [[National Health Service]], pensions, and social security was expanded.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] until he retired to make way for [[Anthony Eden]] just before his party's [[1955 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1955]]. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\nBy 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm|work=BBC News|title=1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success.<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/unemployment|title=Unemployment|work=politics.co.uk}}</ref> Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy. Harold Wilson and Anthony Wedgwood Benn further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election.\n\nBritain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again. [[Harold Wilson]], the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] before increasing his majority in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], was surprisingly voted out of power in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. The new Conservative government was led by [[Edward Heath]].\n\nDuring the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]-[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] (led by [[Edward Heath]]) nor the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government which succeeded it (led by [[Harold Wilson]] and from 1976 [[James Callaghan]]) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%.\n\nUnemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the [[Winter of Discontent]], leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974).<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\"/>\n\nThis led to the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the [[trade union]]s. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with [[privatisation]] of some sections of the economy. This change has led some to describe this as a 'Third Industrial Revolution', though this term is not widely used.\n\n===1945\u20131951: Age of Austerity===\nAfter the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> Anticipating the end of the conflict, the [[United States]] had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's [[Sterling area|Pound Sterling bloc]]. This was to be realised through the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941, through the establishment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.\n\n[[File:Winter 1947, snowbound bus, Castle Hill, Huddersfield - geograph.org.uk - 1668518.jpg|thumb|A snowbound bus in [[Huddersfield]], during the record-cold winter of 1946-47, which caused major fuel shortages and damaged Britain's fragile post-war economic recovery]]\nImmediately after the war in the Pacific ended, the U.S. halted [[Lend-Lease]], but did give the UK a [[Anglo-American loan|long-term low-interest loan of US$4.33bn]]. The winter of [[Winter of 1946-47 in the United Kingdom|1946\u20131947]] proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be over valued and had to be devalued. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency.\n\nThe major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund he UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> The U.S. began [[Marshall Plan]] grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952'' (1989)</ref> Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like [[France]] and [[West Germany]], who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalisation===\nThe Labour Governments of 1945\u20131951 enacted a political programme rooted in [[collectivism]] that included the [[nationalisation]] of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted.\n\nWith the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The [[Distribution of Industry Act 1945]] designated \"development areas\" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|author=Kenneth O.

In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/industrycommunity/overview/afterworldwar/| title=Programming redevelopment after World War II| author=parliament.uk| publisher=www.parliament.uk| access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nationalizing the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid \u00a3165,000,000. The government set up the [[National Coal Board]] to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it \u00a3150,000,000 to modernize the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalization exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.<ref>Mark Tookey,  \"Three's a Crowd?

Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s.\n\n[[File:Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (14998200805).jpg|thumb|[[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Pwllheli]], Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain]]\nDuring the \"golden age\" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.<ref>[[David Kynaston]], ''Family Britain, 1951\u20131957'' (2009)</ref> Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. [[Holiday camp]]s, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s \u2013 and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The [[BBC]]'s early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.<ref>Peter Gurney, \"The Battle of the Consumer in Postwar Britain,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (2005) 77#4 pp. 956\u2013987 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/499831 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSmall neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by [[chain store]]s and [[shopping centre]]s, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and [[ribbon development]]s springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the [[green belt]] to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.<ref>Willem van Vliet, ''Housing Markets & Policies under Fiscal Austerity'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, ed. ''A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939\u20132000''</ref> Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthew Hollow|title='The Age of Affluence': Council Estates and Consumer Society|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=16|issue=1|pages=279\u2013296|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nEntitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.<ref>C.P. Hill, ''British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964''</ref> For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'' magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\"  As summed up by [[R. J. Unstead]],\n:\"Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and\\ the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\"<ref>R.J. Unstead, ''A Century of Change: 1837\u2013Today'' (1963) p 224</ref>\n\nAs noted by historian Martin Pugh:\n:\"Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of \u00a38 a week in 1951 to \u00a315 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\"<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Speak for Britain! A New History of the Labour Party'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8cIz32iH7BQC&pg=PA315&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false pp 115\u201316]</ref>\n\nThe number one selection for the housewife was a washing machine. Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958, and 60 percent in 1966.<ref>Dominic Sandbrook, ''Never had it so good: a history of Britain from Suez to the Beatles'' (2005) p 112.</ref> By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.<ref>John Burnett, ''A Social History of Housing 1815\u20131985'' (1990) p 302</ref>\n\n===Relative Decline===\nFrom a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.<ref>Brian Lapping, ''The Labour Government 1964\u201370''</ref> Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.<ref>David McDowall, ''Britain in Close-Up''</ref> In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.<ref>Anthony Sampson, ''The Essential Anatomy of Britain: Democracy in Crisis'' (1993) p 64</ref>\n\nIndustrial growth in Britain, while remaining steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as strong as on the continent. The statistics can be deceptive,  because Britain was far ahead of other European nations in terms of industrial development and urbanization. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialization and urbanization Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This approach is known as the \"early start theory\" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post-industrial, service-based economy.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\">Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951 \u2013 1970'' (2009) p 305</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref> These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanized nation in Europe had only a paltry 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural farmers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and accordingly limited growth potential.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations. [[Tony Judt]] described the prevailing attitude of post-war industrialists: \"British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=358}}</ref> The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% percent of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=354\u2013357}}</ref> However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of-the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called \"rejuvenation by defeat\".<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=357}}</ref> British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy.\n\nRapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements.\n\n====Suez Crisis====\nAlthough the '50s were overall a time of great prosperity for Britain, the [[Suez Crisis]] of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1994|p=585}}</ref> The tripartite invasion of the [[Suez Canal Zone]] by Britain, France and Israel following Egypt's [[nationalisation]] of the [[Suez Canal Company]] (hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government) was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on Sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US Dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion \u00a3214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further \u00a3279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce \u00a31.965 billion left in Sterling reserves.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Within days Prime Minister Eden was appealing to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=297}}</ref> British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the Pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the Dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency.\n\n===1960\u20131979: the Sixties and Seventies===\n{{See also|Three-Day Week|Winter of Discontent}}\n\n====Deindustrialization====\nDeindustrialization meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = High | first = Steven | title = \"The wounds of class\": a historiographical reflection on the study of deindustrialization, 1973\u20132013 | journal = [[History Compass]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = 994\u20131007 | doi = 10.1111/hic3.12099 | date = November 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref> A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up.

Coal mining slowly collapsed, and finally disappeared in the 21st century. The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the automobile industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury production.

As negative factors coalesced during the 1960s, the slogan used by Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] \"(most of) our people have never had it so good\" seemed increasingly hollow. The Conservative Government presided over a \u2018stop-go\u2019 economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period. \n\nIn comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician [[Richard Crossman]], after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a:\n:sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> \nEconomists provided four overlapping explanations. The \"early start\" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the \"rejuvenation by defeat,\" whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of \"Imperial distractions\", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of \"institutional failure\" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative. .<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role '' pp 305-6</ref>. An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management.\n\n====Labour responds====\nThe result was a major political crisis, and a [[Winter of Discontent]] in the winter of 1978\u20131979 in during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.<ref>Alwyn W.  Turner, ''Crisis?  What Crisis?  Britain in the 1970s'' (2008)</ref><ref>Andy Beckett, ''When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZODPF6/ excerpt and text search].</ref>\n\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarized the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n:If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's  term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular ''modus vivendi'' with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that [[Mrs. Thatcher]] resoundingly defeated it in 1979.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (4th ed. 1993)  p 324.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]] from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually was forced to devalue the pound again in 1967. Economist [[Nicholas Crafts]] attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor [[industrial relations]] and insufficient [[vocational training]]. He writes that this was a period of [[government failure]] caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism and a failure to confront interest groups.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/>\n\nBoth political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) with other, non EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945\u20131965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period. [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967.\n\nThe [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election in June 1970]] saw the Conservatives, now led by [[Edward Heath]], achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally.  It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/heath.htm]\n\nHowever, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the Conservative Government of Edward Heath (1970\u20131974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union,  plus the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]], led to a [[Three-Day Week|three-day week]] in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]], a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the [[Winter of Discontent]], and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by [[James Callaghan]], who had succeeded Wilson in 1976.\n\nUnemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 1970s, oil was found in the [[North Sea]], off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people.\n\n===1979\u20131990: the Thatcher era===\n{{see also|Thatcherism}}\nThe election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 marked the end of the [[post-war consensus]] and a new approach to economic policy, including [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]],\nreform of industrial relations, and tax changes. [[Competition policy]] was emphasised instead of [[industrial policy]]; consequent [[deindustrialisation]] and [[structural unemployment]] was more or less accepted.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/> Thatcher's battles with the unions culminated in the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] of 1984.\n\nThe Government applied [[monetarist]] policies to reduce inflation, and reduced public spending. Deflationary measures were implemented against the backdrop of the [[early 1980s recession|recession of 1980/81]]. Inflation was at its worst at over 20% in 1980, but by 1982-83 it had subsided to less than 10% and continued to subside until stabilizing at around 4% in the autumn of 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain |first=Kenneth O. |last=Morgan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |p=581}}</ref> With the recession of 1980/81, unemployment passed 2 million in the autumn of 1980, 2.5 million the following spring. By January 1982, unemployment had reached 3 million for the first time since the early 1930s, though this time the figure accounted for a lesser percentage of the workforce than the early 1930s figures, now standing at around 12.5% rather than in excess of 20%.

The ostensible benefit of this was to give the spur of competition to the British economy, and increase its ultimate efficiency.\n\nThe [[Financial Services Act 1986]] led to a [[deregulation]] later dubbed as ''[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]]''.\n\nThe early 1980s recession saw unemployment rise above three million, but the subsequent recovery, which saw annual growth of over 4 percent in the late 1980s, led to contemporary claims of a British 'economic miracle'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kern|first=David|title=UK Economic Decline: 'Myth' or Reality?|url=http://www.rozenbergps.com/books/britain/kern.pdf}}</ref> There is significant controversy as to whether Thatcherism was the reason for the boom in Britain in the 1980s; North Sea oil has been identified as a contributing factor in the increases in economic growth in the mid and late 1980s. However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them.\n\nIndeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of [[Michael Foot]] as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times.\n\nBy the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2008/10/unemployment-in-uk.html|title=Economics Essays: Unemployment in the UK|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131997: the Major years===\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue. [[John Major]] was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by [[Neil Kinnock]] since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983.\n\nDespite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992.\n\nEconomic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s recession was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession. It had started during 1990 and the end of the recession was not officially declared until April 1993, by which time nearly 3 million people were unemployed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm | work=BBC News | title=1993: Recession over - it's official | date=26 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe British pound was tied to EU exchange rates, using the [[Deutsche Mark]] as a basis, as part of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM); however, this resulted in disaster for Britain. The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency. [[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997.\n\nDespite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/economic-record-of-gordon-brown.html|title=Economics Essays: Economic Record of Gordon Brown.|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132001: New Labour===\n{{see also|Blairism}}\nFrom May 1997, [[Tony Blair]]'s newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], gained a reputation by some as the \"prudent Chancellor\" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the [[Bank of England]], effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency.  Labour also introduced the [[minimum wage]] to the [[United Kingdom]], which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s - a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Further|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\nIn the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the [[National Health Service]], which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first [[Afghanistan]], invading in 2001 and then [[Iraq]], in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by [[David Cameron]]) in the opinion polls.\n\nBy this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with [[General Motors]] ([[Vauxhall]]) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while [[Peugeot]] (the French carmaker who had bought the former [[Rootes Group]] and [[Chrysler Europe]] operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when [[MG Rover]] went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times.\n\nGrowth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. The [[Pound Sterling|pound]] continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per \u00a31), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per \u00a31 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately \u20ac1.45 per \u00a31. Since then, the effects of the [[Credit crunch]] have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around \u20ac1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below \u20ac1.02 and ending the year at \u20ac1.04.\n\n===The 2008 recession and quantitative easing===\n{{Update section|date=June 2014}}\nThe UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman's work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington's and glass manufacture.<ref>John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S \u2018Fifty years of Business History\u2019, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26</ref><ref>. Leslie Hannah, \u2018New Issues in British Business History\u2019, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.</ref>  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler's synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L.

Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]](Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics|Money}}\n* [[Economy of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Poor Laws]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[European Single Market]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[History of England]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of Scotland]]\n** [[History of Wales]]\n* [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Economic history of Scotland]]\n* [[History of trade unions in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[English society]]\n* [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]], includes some economic topics\n* [[History of company law in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Aldcroft |first=D.

These developments resulted in Britain becoming the premier economies in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy and a major political entity. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. Britons pioneered the [[railway]] system and built many systems and sold most of the equipment other nations used.  Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. The markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding [[British Empire]]. After 1840, an economic policy of [[mercantilism]] was abandoned and replaced by \"free trade,\" with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions.

In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by [[Economic history of Australia|Australia]]. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by [[Economic History of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 percent above of the six founder members of the [[EEC]], but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies. <ref>Lee, Clive.

Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the 2007 crisis, British income  per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of [[Economic history of France|France]] and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA.

Great Britain, together with the [[Low Countries]], profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

There were multiple results that all helped expand and grow the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester.  The key features of the growth pattern included specialization and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of  promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by hard specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities  to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new upscale market demands. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.<ref>N.

Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen [[broadcloth]].  This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.<ref>Robert Brenner, ''Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653'' (Verso, 2003).</ref><ref>E.

The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500-1750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E.

A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England.  Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back.  However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119-20.</ref>\n\n===Diets===\nThe diet depended largely on social class. The rich ate meat\u2014beef, pork, venison\u2014and white bread, the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat perhaps at Christmas. Everyone drank ale\u2014water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of old salted meat. Vegetables and fruits were not popular. The potato was not part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.<ref>Stephen Mennell, ''All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996).</ref>\n\nAmong the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman.  Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known.\n\nBoth the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in [[scurvy]].\n\nTrade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread distress.<ref>Andrew B. Appleby, ''Famine in Tudor and Stuart England'' (Stanford University Press, 1978).</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do in France.<ref>Andrew B.

By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nWhile the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and Prussia's [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from \u00a36.5 million in 1700, to \u00a314.7 million in 1760 and \u00a343.2 million in 1800.<ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) p 188.</ref>  Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.<ref>Eric J.

The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331 million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king.  His chief minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp 334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141\u2013165</ref>\n\n=== The Age of Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding [[English overseas possessions]], which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the [[West Indies]] such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Bermuda]], and of Virginia, one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the [[Maritime provinces]] of what is now Canada.  The sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Great Britain control over what is now eastern Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|page=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants&mdash;and kept others out&mdash;by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The [[Navigation Acts]] of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] united Scotland with England).<ref>Darwin, 2012 p.21-22</ref> Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.<ref>Darwin, 2012 p. 166</ref>\n\nThe government had to fight smuggling&mdash;which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|page=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R.

The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.<ref>H. R. Schubert, ''History of the British Iron and Steel Industry ... to 1775 AD'' (Routledge, 1957)</ref>\n\n=== The Industrial Revolution ===\n{{main|Industrial Revolution}}\n\nIn a period loosely dated from the 1770s to the 1820s, Britain experienced an accelerated process of economic change that transformed a largely agrarian economy into the world's first industrial economy. This phenomenon is known as the \"[[industrial revolution]]\", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.<ref>E. Anthony Wrigley, \"Reconsidering the Industrial Revolution: England and Wales.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 49.01 (2018): 9-42.</ref>\n\nEconomic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamental power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]]. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, [[turnpike trusts|improved roads]] and [[Rail transport|railways]]. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.<ref>Redford, Arthur (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBQNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&dq=population+movement+industrial+revolution&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KIP-Tue3BIKV8gPR6LzQBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Labour migration in England, 1800-1850\"], p. 6. Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of [[water wheel]]s and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as [[industrialisation]].\n\nAccording to [[Max Weber]], the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the Puritans of the 17th century.<ref>Hartmut Lehmann and Guenther Roth, eds. ''Weber's Protestant Ethic: Origins, Evidence, Contexts'' (1995)</ref>  This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\" amongst skilled artisans.<ref>Margaret C. Jacob, and Matthew Kadane, \"Missing, Now Found in the Eighteenth Century: Weber's Protestant Capitalist,\" ''American Historical Review,'' (Feb 2003) 108#1 pp 20-49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/533044 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning. [[James Hargreaves]] created the [[Spinning Jenny]], a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the [[water frame]], invented by [[Richard Arkwright]], could be powered by a [[water wheel]]. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the [[factory system]] in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the [[spinning mule]] (a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by [[Samuel Crompton]]. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport.\n\nAs they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as [[New Lanark]] Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the [[domestic system]], in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages.\n\nThe [[steam engine]] was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]], and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by [[James Watt]]; it had a [[reciprocating engine]] capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns.\n\nThe progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the [[North West of England]], though wool remained the chief textile in [[Yorkshire]]. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the [[iron industry]]; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system.\n\nSuch an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of [[mass production]] and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] has posited the 1790s as the \"take-off\" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion.\n\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of [[coal]], the main fuel of the new revolution.\n\nIt was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[capitalism]]. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of [[liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, such as [[Richard Cobden]], [[Joseph Hume]], [[Francis Place]] and [[John Roebuck]].\n\nSome have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British [[slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slave trade and the [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations provided less than 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513025327/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the [[cottage industry]] of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain.\n\n===Empire===\n{{main|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}\nDuring the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.<ref>Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997'' (2010)</ref>  It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. Capitalism encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with [[History of Canada|Canada]], which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and [[History of Australia|Australia]], which followed suit in 1901.<ref>Peter Cain and Tony Hopkins. ''British Imperialism: 1688-2000'' (2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\nCritical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.  With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nMost important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared\u2014it was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.<ref>Roger Wells, \"The revolt of the south-west, 1800-1801: a study in English popular protest,\" ''Social History'' (1977) #6 pp 713-744.</ref>  Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 162-4</ref>\n\nThe system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 143, 162</ref>\n\n[[File:Dette britannique longue p\u00e9riode.png|thumb|The [[national debt]] of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914.]]\nThe British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366 million, including \u00a310 million for the Navy, \u00a340 million for the Army, \u00a310 million for the Allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt.

The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, \"The Impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, on the Long-Run Growth of the British Economy,\" ''Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center'' (1989) 12#3 pp 335-395.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy.

It described itself as 'the workshop of the world', meaning that its finished goods were produced so efficiently and cheaply that they could often undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in almost any other market.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} If political conditions in a particular overseas market were stable enough, Britain could dominate its economy through free trade alone without having to resort to formal rule or mercantilism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Britain was even supplying half the needs in manufactured goods of such nations as Germany, France, Belgium, and the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} By 1820, 30% of Britain's exports went to [[British Empire|its Empire]], rising slowly to 35% by 1910.<ref>Andrew Porter, ''The Nineteenth Century The Oxford History of the British Empire Volume 3'' (1999) p 35</ref> Until the latter 19th century, India remained Britain's economic jewel in terms of both imports and exports.

Robinson and John Gallagher, ''Africa and the Victorians: The official mind of imperialism'' (1966).</ref>  They found that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" had to be based upon formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal influence in independent areas.  According to Wm.patrick santian at mesita elementary\n historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire.

This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories.  Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system.  In 1815, [[George Stephenson]] invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways ''system'' in 1825 by opening the [[Stockton and Darlington]] line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building\u2014a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. [[Thomas Brassey]] brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model.  Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845\u201347, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of \u00a3200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices.\n[[File:George Hudson - Project Gutenberg eText 17293.jpg|200px|thumb|[[George Hudson]]]]\n\n[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859) designed the first major railway, the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]], built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial [[George Hudson]]. He became Britain's \"railway king\" by merging numerous short lines.<ref>A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, ''George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King'' (2004)</ref>  Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the [[Railway Clearing House]]. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds\u2014paying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.<ref>Adrian Vaughan, ''Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain'' (1997) pp 102-12</ref>\n\n[[File:Euston Station showing wrought iron roof of 1837.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Euston railway station|Euston station in London]], 1837. Note the open passenger carriages]]\n\nBy 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal.  The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.<ref>[[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]] and Gordon Biddle, ''The Oxford Companion to British Railway History: From 1603 to the 1990s'' (1999)</ref>\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution ===\n{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|thumb]]\n[[File:graph rel lvl indz 1750 1900 01.png|thumb]]\nDuring the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers, industrial capitalism gave way to [[financial capitalism]] and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nNew products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with [[steamship]]s, such as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] ''[[SS Great Western]]''. Electricity and [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany.\n\nAmalgamation of industrial [[cartel]]s into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and [[internal combustion engine]]s fuelled by gasoline) were mixed blessings for British business during the late [[Victorian era]]. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &mdash; and falling &mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.\n\nBy the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas &mdash; particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as [[Egypt]]), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the Crystal Palace Speech. At the end of the [[Victorian era]], the [[service sector]] (banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 percent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The crown jewel was India, where in the 1750s a private British company, with its own army, the [[East India Company]] (or \"John Company\"), took control of parts of India. The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the Company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned. Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the government closed down the Company and took control of [[British India]] and the Company's [[Presidency Armies]].<ref>Lawrence James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (2000)</ref>\n\nFree trade (with no tariffs and few trade barriers) was introduced in the 1840s.

Businessmen eager to sell Indian opium in the vast China market led to the Opium War (1839\u20131842) and the establishment of British colonies at [[History of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. One adventurer, [[James Brooke]], set himself up as the Rajah of the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]] in North Borneo in 1842; his realm joined the Empire in 1888. [[Cecil Rhodes]] set up an economic empire of diamonds in South Africa that proved highly profitable. There were great riches in gold as well but this venture led to expensive wars with the [[Second Boer War|Dutch settlers known as Boers]].\n\nThe possessions of the East India Company in India, under the direct rule of the Crown from 1857 \u2014known as British India\u2014 was the centrepiece of the Empire, and because of an efficient taxation system it paid its own administrative expenses as well as the cost of the large [[British Indian Army]].

To protect the canal, Britain expanded further, taking control of Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden, and British Somaliland.  None were especially profitable until the discovery of oil in the Middle East after 1920.  Some military action was involved, and from time to time there was a risk of conflict with other imperial powers seeking the same territory, as in the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898.  All the incidents were resolved peacefully.\n\nCain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873-1879, and was marked above all by price [[deflation]], and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers. Shrinking returns and a generally unfavorable economic climate meant that investment as a percentage of Britain's [[National wealth]], both overseas and at home, fell from an average of 12.6% between 1870\u201374, to 9.7% between 1875-1896.<ref>Musson, 1959; p. 211</ref> The sluggish world market, which was at its weakest in the 1880s, was keenly felt in the export-reliant economy of the UK.

Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high. \n\nBy international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900. \n\nIt has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined. The City was the financial centre of the world\u2014far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. British investment abroad doubled in the Edwardian years, from \u00a32 billion in 1900 to \u00a34 billion in 1913.<ref name=\"John Darwin 2012\"/> Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations.  The British held huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways.  These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. Social amenities, especially in urban centres, were accumulating \u2013 prosperity was highly visible. Among the working class there was a growing demand for access to a greater say in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues only became significant about 1908. In large part, it was the demands of the coal miners and railway workers, as articulated by their trade unions, that prompted a high level of strike activity in the years immediately before the First World War. <ref>Arthur J Taylor, \"The Economy,\" in Simon Nowell-Smith,  ed., ''Edwardian England: 1901-1914'' (1964) pp105-138</ref>\n\n===Labour Movement===\nThe rise of a powerful, concerted, and politically effective labour movement was one of the major socio-economic phenomena of the Edwardian years in the UK.

In 1922, for example, the volume of cotton exports was only about half of what it had been in 1913, while coal exports were only one third of their 1913 levels.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.<ref>A.

Willan'' (Manchester University Press, 1977), pp. 258-78.</ref> In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.<ref>R. J. Finlay, \"National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the 'end of Scotland', 1920-1939,\" ''History,'' June 1994, vol. 79, (256), pp. 242-59.</ref>\n\n===Productivity & Employment===\nIn 1919, Britain reduced the working hours in major industries to a 48-hour week for industrial workers. Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.<ref>Peter Scott and Anna Spadavecchia, \"Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 2011) 64#4 pp 1266-1288</ref> By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter & Mears| year=2011| p=155}}</ref> By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent [[deflation]]ary policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high [[Real wages|real wage]] for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/research/floudjohnsonchaptersep16-03.pdf| title=The British Economy Between the Wars| author=Barry Eichengreen| publisher=eml.berkeley.edu| year=2002| p=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922\u20131923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth.

In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, and in 1893 3 million tons; by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.<ref>B. R.

The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] formed in 1888, and counted 600,000 members in 1908. Much of the 'old left' of Labour politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas.<ref>Vic Allen, ''The militancy of British miners'' (1981).</ref>\n\n====General Strike of 1926====\n{{main|General Strike of 1926}}\nIn April 1926 the owners locked out the miners because they had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices caused by demand as oil started to replace coal.<ref>W.N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England, 1914-1964'' (2nd ed. 1967) pp 223-30</ref> The general strike was led by the TUC for the benefit of coal miners, but it failed.  It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history and TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"The General Strike, 1926,\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001-1012 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638422 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], \"The General Strike,\" ''[[History Today]]'' (2006) 56#5 pp 40-47</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.\n\nCoal continued as a sick industry as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the rest. The Labour government in 1947 nationalized coal into the National Coal Board, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.<ref>Ben Fine, ''The Coal Question: Political Economy and Industrial Change from the Nineteenth Century to the Present Day''  (1990).</ref> By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward.  Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970.  The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911.<ref>B. R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics'' (1975) pp 361-8, 163</ref>\n\n===New Industries===\nWhile Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the [[Import Duties Act 1932]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|issue=5|pages=703\u2013711|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture.

By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=157}}</ref> Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the [[Central Electricity Board]] in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed.

These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\">{{cite article| url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000000249| title=Women, Other ''Fresh'' Workers, and the New Manufacturing Workforce of Interwar Britain| publisher=International Review of Social History |volume= 45| year=2000| p=456}}</ref> These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], particularly [[Coventry, England|Coventry]] and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\"/>\n\n===1920s \"consumer boom\"===\nIn spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged \"consumer culture\" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or \"the wireless\" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket.\n\nTourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and [[Skegness]] were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.<ref>Rex Pope, \"A Consumer Service in Interwar Britain: The Hotel Trade, 1924-1938,\" ''Business History Review,'' (Winter 2000) 74#4 pp 657-82</ref>\n\nElectricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s.\n\n===1929\u20131939: the Great Depression===\n{{main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]\nWhile the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall St Crash]] of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s.  Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting [[Tariff Reform]] as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the [[Gold Standard]]. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s. [[Marks & Spencer]], for example, increased its turnover from \u00a32.5 million in 1929 to over \u00a325 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/>\n\nIn 1929 [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed his second minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and the Fascists under [[Oswald Mosley]]. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the Labour Government resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be [[National_Government_(1931)|replaced]] by a McDonald-led [[National_Government_(United_Kingdom)|National Government]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in 1935.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Further|United Kingdom home front during World War II}}\nIn the [[Second World War]], 1939\u201345, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the [[home front]] for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.<ref>Robin Havers, ''The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943'' (2002) Volume 4, p 75</ref>  Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.<ref>W.K.

In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.<ref>Peter Howlett, \"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44</ref> Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure.  The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940\u2014more than enough to cover the losses\u2014and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.<ref>Postan (1952), Chapter 4.</ref>  Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion<ref>Hancock, ''British War Economy'' [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-Stats-3.html online p 353]</ref>\n\nAfter war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed [[exchange controls]]. The British Government used its [[gold reserves]] and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted [[Lend-Lease]], whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.<ref>There were some exceptions and $650 million was repaid.

The Labour government chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like Germany had. \nGermany rebuilt factories like the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. Germany, France and Italy were fully re-engineered with all electric rail lines.  In Britain, steam engines, mechanical semaphore signalling and old track would remain into the 1960s. In addition, the road and telecommunications network in Britain remained equally inadequate, ill-maintained and out-of-date.\n\nBy 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Correlli |title=The Wasting of Britain's Marshall Aid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml |website=BBC History |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], just after the end of the war in Europe, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy. Taxes were increased, industries were nationalised, and the [[welfare state]] with the [[National Health Service]], pensions, and social security was expanded.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] until he retired to make way for [[Anthony Eden]] just before his party's [[1955 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1955]]. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\nBy 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm|work=BBC News|title=1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success.<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/unemployment|title=Unemployment|work=politics.co.uk}}</ref> Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy. Harold Wilson and Anthony Wedgwood Benn further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election.\n\nBritain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again. [[Harold Wilson]], the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] before increasing his majority in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], was surprisingly voted out of power in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. The new Conservative government was led by [[Edward Heath]].\n\nDuring the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]-[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] (led by [[Edward Heath]]) nor the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government which succeeded it (led by [[Harold Wilson]] and from 1976 [[James Callaghan]]) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%.\n\nUnemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the [[Winter of Discontent]], leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974).<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\"/>\n\nThis led to the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the [[trade union]]s. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with [[privatisation]] of some sections of the economy. This change has led some to describe this as a 'Third Industrial Revolution', though this term is not widely used.\n\n===1945\u20131951: Age of Austerity===\nAfter the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> Anticipating the end of the conflict, the [[United States]] had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's [[Sterling area|Pound Sterling bloc]]. This was to be realised through the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941, through the establishment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.\n\n[[File:Winter 1947, snowbound bus, Castle Hill, Huddersfield - geograph.org.uk - 1668518.jpg|thumb|A snowbound bus in [[Huddersfield]], during the record-cold winter of 1946-47, which caused major fuel shortages and damaged Britain's fragile post-war economic recovery]]\nImmediately after the war in the Pacific ended, the U.S. halted [[Lend-Lease]], but did give the UK a [[Anglo-American loan|long-term low-interest loan of US$4.33bn]]. The winter of [[Winter of 1946-47 in the United Kingdom|1946\u20131947]] proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be over valued and had to be devalued. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency.\n\nThe major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund he UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> The U.S. began [[Marshall Plan]] grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952'' (1989)</ref> Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like [[France]] and [[West Germany]], who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalisation===\nThe Labour Governments of 1945\u20131951 enacted a political programme rooted in [[collectivism]] that included the [[nationalisation]] of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted.\n\nWith the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The [[Distribution of Industry Act 1945]] designated \"development areas\" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=562\u2013563}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, the British government pumped some \u00a3300 million into the building of 481 new factories in these regions, to be leased to private industry. In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/industrycommunity/overview/afterworldwar/| title=Programming redevelopment after World War II| author=parliament.uk| publisher=www.parliament.uk| access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nationalizing the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid \u00a3165,000,000. The government set up the [[National Coal Board]] to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it \u00a3150,000,000 to modernize the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalization exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.<ref>Mark Tookey,  \"Three's a Crowd?

Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s.\n\n[[File:Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (14998200805).jpg|thumb|[[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Pwllheli]], Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain]]\nDuring the \"golden age\" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.<ref>[[David Kynaston]], ''Family Britain, 1951\u20131957'' (2009)</ref> Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. [[Holiday camp]]s, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s \u2013 and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The [[BBC]]'s early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.<ref>Peter Gurney, \"The Battle of the Consumer in Postwar Britain,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (2005) 77#4 pp. 956\u2013987 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/499831 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSmall neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by [[chain store]]s and [[shopping centre]]s, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and [[ribbon development]]s springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the [[green belt]] to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.<ref>Willem van Vliet, ''Housing Markets & Policies under Fiscal Austerity'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, ed. ''A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939\u20132000''</ref> Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthew Hollow|title='The Age of Affluence': Council Estates and Consumer Society|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=16|issue=1|pages=279\u2013296|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nEntitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.<ref>C.P. Hill, ''British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964''</ref> For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'' magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\"  As summed up by [[R. J. Unstead]],\n:\"Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and\\ the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\"<ref>R.J.

Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of \u00a38 a week in 1951 to \u00a315 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\"<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Speak for Britain!

Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958, and 60 percent in 1966.<ref>Dominic Sandbrook, ''Never had it so good: a history of Britain from Suez to the Beatles'' (2005) p 112.</ref> By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.<ref>John Burnett, ''A Social History of Housing 1815\u20131985'' (1990) p 302</ref>\n\n===Relative Decline===\nFrom a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.<ref>Brian Lapping, ''The Labour Government 1964\u201370''</ref> Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.<ref>David McDowall, ''Britain in Close-Up''</ref> In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.<ref>Anthony Sampson, ''The Essential Anatomy of Britain: Democracy in Crisis'' (1993) p 64</ref>\n\nIndustrial growth in Britain, while remaining steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as strong as on the continent. The statistics can be deceptive,  because Britain was far ahead of other European nations in terms of industrial development and urbanization. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialization and urbanization Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This approach is known as the \"early start theory\" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post-industrial, service-based economy.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\">Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951 \u2013 1970'' (2009) p 305</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref> These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanized nation in Europe had only a paltry 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural farmers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and accordingly limited growth potential.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations. [[Tony Judt]] described the prevailing attitude of post-war industrialists: \"British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=358}}</ref> The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% percent of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=354\u2013357}}</ref> However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of-the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called \"rejuvenation by defeat\".<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=357}}</ref> British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy.\n\nRapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements.\n\n====Suez Crisis====\nAlthough the '50s were overall a time of great prosperity for Britain, the [[Suez Crisis]] of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1994|p=585}}</ref> The tripartite invasion of the [[Suez Canal Zone]] by Britain, France and Israel following Egypt's [[nationalisation]] of the [[Suez Canal Company]] (hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government) was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on Sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US Dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion \u00a3214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further \u00a3279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce \u00a31.965 billion left in Sterling reserves.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Within days Prime Minister Eden was appealing to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=297}}</ref> British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the Pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the Dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency.\n\n===1960\u20131979: the Sixties and Seventies===\n{{See also|Three-Day Week|Winter of Discontent}}\n\n====Deindustrialization====\nDeindustrialization meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = High | first = Steven | title = \"The wounds of class\": a historiographical reflection on the study of deindustrialization, 1973\u20132013 | journal = [[History Compass]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = 994\u20131007 | doi = 10.1111/hic3.12099 | date = November 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref> A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up.

The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the automobile industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury production.

As negative factors coalesced during the 1960s, the slogan used by Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] \"(most of) our people have never had it so good\" seemed increasingly hollow. The Conservative Government presided over a \u2018stop-go\u2019 economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period. \n\nIn comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician [[Richard Crossman]], after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a:\n:sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> \nEconomists provided four overlapping explanations. The \"early start\" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the \"rejuvenation by defeat,\" whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of \"Imperial distractions\", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of \"institutional failure\" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative. .<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role '' pp 305-6</ref>. An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management.\n\n====Labour responds====\nThe result was a major political crisis, and a [[Winter of Discontent]] in the winter of 1978\u20131979 in during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.<ref>Alwyn W.  Turner, ''Crisis?  What Crisis?  Britain in the 1970s'' (2008)</ref><ref>Andy Beckett, ''When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZODPF6/ excerpt and text search].</ref>\n\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarized the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n:If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's  term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular ''modus vivendi'' with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that [[Mrs. Thatcher]] resoundingly defeated it in 1979.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (4th ed. 1993)  p 324.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]] from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually was forced to devalue the pound again in 1967. Economist [[Nicholas Crafts]] attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor [[industrial relations]] and insufficient [[vocational training]]. He writes that this was a period of [[government failure]] caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism and a failure to confront interest groups.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/>\n\nBoth political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) with other, non EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945\u20131965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period. [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967.\n\nThe [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election in June 1970]] saw the Conservatives, now led by [[Edward Heath]], achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally.  It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/heath.htm]\n\nHowever, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the Conservative Government of Edward Heath (1970\u20131974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union,  plus the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]], led to a [[Three-Day Week|three-day week]] in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]], a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the [[Winter of Discontent]], and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by [[James Callaghan]], who had succeeded Wilson in 1976.\n\nUnemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 1970s, oil was found in the [[North Sea]], off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people.\n\n===1979\u20131990: the Thatcher era===\n{{see also|Thatcherism}}\nThe election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 marked the end of the [[post-war consensus]] and a new approach to economic policy, including [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]],\nreform of industrial relations, and tax changes. [[Competition policy]] was emphasised instead of [[industrial policy]]; consequent [[deindustrialisation]] and [[structural unemployment]] was more or less accepted.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/> Thatcher's battles with the unions culminated in the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] of 1984.\n\nThe Government applied [[monetarist]] policies to reduce inflation, and reduced public spending. Deflationary measures were implemented against the backdrop of the [[early 1980s recession|recession of 1980/81]]. Inflation was at its worst at over 20% in 1980, but by 1982-83 it had subsided to less than 10% and continued to subside until stabilizing at around 4% in the autumn of 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain |first=Kenneth O. |last=Morgan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |p=581}}</ref> With the recession of 1980/81, unemployment passed 2 million in the autumn of 1980, 2.5 million the following spring. By January 1982, unemployment had reached 3 million for the first time since the early 1930s, though this time the figure accounted for a lesser percentage of the workforce than the early 1930s figures, now standing at around 12.5% rather than in excess of 20%. In areas hit particularly hard by the loss of industry, unemployment was much higher; coming close to 20% in [[Northern Ireland]] and exceeding 15% in many parts of [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and northern England.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm | work=BBC News | title=1982: UK unemployment tops three million | date=26 January 1982}}</ref> The peak of unemployment actually came some two years after the recession ended and growth had been re-established, when in April 1984 unemployment stood at just under 3.3 million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fullfact.org/factchecks/labour_attacks_the_tories_in_scotland-1444 |title=Labour attacks the Tories in Scotland |website=[[Full Fact]] |access-date=18 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816212654/http://fullfact.org/factchecks/labour_attacks_the_tories_in_scotland-1444 |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canary Wharf at night, from Shadwell cropped.jpg|thumb|The development of a new financial centre at Canary Wharf was initiated by the Thatcher government to revitalize London's disused docklands area]]\nAccording to [[Eric Hobsbawm]], Thatcher oversaw an \"industrial holocaust\", which saw Britain's industrial capacity decrease by fully one quarter during the years 1980\u201384.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Age of Extremes|last = Hobsbawm|first = Eric|publisher = Abacus|year = 1994|isbn = |location = London|pages = 304}}</ref> Major state-controlled firms were privatised, including [[British Aerospace]] (1981), [[British Telecom]] (1984), [[British Leyland]] (1984), [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (1987), and [[British Steel Corporation]] (1988).

The ostensible benefit of this was to give the spur of competition to the British economy, and increase its ultimate efficiency.\n\nThe [[Financial Services Act 1986]] led to a [[deregulation]] later dubbed as ''[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]]''.\n\nThe early 1980s recession saw unemployment rise above three million, but the subsequent recovery, which saw annual growth of over 4 percent in the late 1980s, led to contemporary claims of a British 'economic miracle'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kern|first=David|title=UK Economic Decline: 'Myth' or Reality?|url=http://www.rozenbergps.com/books/britain/kern.pdf}}</ref> There is significant controversy as to whether Thatcherism was the reason for the boom in Britain in the 1980s; North Sea oil has been identified as a contributing factor in the increases in economic growth in the mid and late 1980s. However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them.\n\nIndeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of [[Michael Foot]] as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times.\n\nBy the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2008/10/unemployment-in-uk.html|title=Economics Essays: Unemployment in the UK|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131997: the Major years===\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue. [[John Major]] was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by [[Neil Kinnock]] since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983.\n\nDespite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992.\n\nEconomic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s recession was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession.

The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency. [[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997.\n\nDespite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/economic-record-of-gordon-brown.html|title=Economics Essays: Economic Record of Gordon Brown.|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132001: New Labour===\n{{see also|Blairism}}\nFrom May 1997, [[Tony Blair]]'s newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], gained a reputation by some as the \"prudent Chancellor\" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the [[Bank of England]], effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency.  Labour also introduced the [[minimum wage]] to the [[United Kingdom]], which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s - a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Further|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\nIn the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the [[National Health Service]], which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first [[Afghanistan]], invading in 2001 and then [[Iraq]], in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by [[David Cameron]]) in the opinion polls.\n\nBy this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with [[General Motors]] ([[Vauxhall]]) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while [[Peugeot]] (the French carmaker who had bought the former [[Rootes Group]] and [[Chrysler Europe]] operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when [[MG Rover]] went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times.\n\nGrowth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. The [[Pound Sterling|pound]] continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per \u00a31), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per \u00a31 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately \u20ac1.45 per \u00a31. Since then, the effects of the [[Credit crunch]] have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around \u20ac1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below \u20ac1.02 and ending the year at \u20ac1.04.\n\n===The 2008 recession and quantitative easing===\n{{Update section|date=June 2014}}\nThe UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009.

The new government was faced with having to make deep public spending cuts over the following years in order to tackle the high level of national debt which had mounted up during Labour's response to the recession, which meant that unemployment remained high and the economy struggled to re-establish growth, although a marked improvement finally occurred in 2013 when economic growth and falling unemployment were sustained.\n\n[[Moody's]] maintained the UK's AAA credit rating in September 2010, forecasting stable finances largely driven by governmental action.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954.

Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler's synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L.

More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]](Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics|Money}}\n* [[Economy of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Poor Laws]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[European Single Market]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[History of England]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of Scotland]]\n** [[History of Wales]]\n* [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Economic history of Scotland]]\n* [[History of trade unions in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[English society]]\n* [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]], includes some economic topics\n* [[History of company law in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Aldcroft |first=D.

{"title_page": "History of South Australia", "text_new": "{{History of Australia}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use Australian English|date= July 2015}}\nThe '''history of South Australia''' includes the history of the Australian state of [[South Australia]] since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, and the area's preceding [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] and [[British colony|British colonial]] societies. [[Aboriginal Australians]] of various nations or tribes have lived in South Australia for at least thirty thousand years, while British colonists arrived in the 19th century to establish a free colony. The ''[[South Australia Act, 1834]]'' created the '''Province of South Australia''', built according to the principles of systematic colonisation, with no convict settlers; after the colony nearly went bankrupt, the ''[[South Australia Act 1842]]'' gave the British Government full control of South Australia as a [[Crown Colony]]. After some amendments to the form of government in the intervening years, South Australia became a self-governing colony in 1857 with the ratification of the ''[[Constitution Act 1856]]'', and the [[Parliament of South Australia]] was formed. \n\nMeanwhile, [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] were sent deep into the interior, discovering some pastoral land, but mainly large tracts of desert terrain. Sheep and other livestock were imported, wheat and other crops were grown where possible and a thriving [[viticulture]] industry was established. Copper was discovered. German Lutheran refugees set up mission stations and developed the wine industry in the [[Barossa Valley]].\n\nThe colony became a cradle of democratic and land reform in Australia.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] of various nations or tribes have lived in South Australia for at least thirty thousand years, while British colonists arrived in the 19th century to establish a free colony. The ''[[South Australia Act, 1834]]'' created the '''Province of South Australia''', built according to the principles of systematic colonisation, with no convict settlers; after the colony nearly went bankrupt, the ''[[South Australia Act 1842]]'' gave the British Government full control of South Australia as a [[Crown Colony]]. After some amendments to the form of government in the intervening years, South Australia became a self-governing colony in 1857 with the ratification of the ''[[Constitution Act 1856]]'', and the [[Parliament of South Australia]] was formed. \n\nMeanwhile, [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] were sent deep into the interior, discovering some pastoral land, but mainly large tracts of desert terrain. Sheep and other livestock were imported, wheat and other crops were grown where possible and a thriving [[viticulture]] industry was established. Copper was discovered. German Lutheran refugees set up mission stations and developed the wine industry in the [[Barossa Valley]].\n\nThe colony became a cradle of democratic and land reform in Australia. It was the first place in the world to institute the system of land registration known as [[Torrens title]] in 1858. Women were granted the vote in the 1890s. South Australia became a [[States and territories of Australia|State]] of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901 following a vote to federate with the other British colonies of Australia. While it has a smaller population than the eastern States, South Australia has often been at the vanguard of political and social change in Australia.\n\nSince World War II refugees and other migrants have boosted both the size and the [[Multiculturalism in Australia|multicultural nature]] of the population.\n\n==Aboriginal settlement==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Australia}}\n[[File:\"Aboriginal Family Travelling\" by W.A.

It was originally broadcast on April 21, 2011 on [[NBC]].\n\nThough it contained no material from previous episodes, the episode had the format of a [[clip show]], parodying the genre and [[self-parody]]ing many aspects of the show itself as the characters took a memory lane down the school year. In it, they point out each member's transgressions in the past year that have affected the group's stability. Jeff ends up giving one of his trademark speeches, and the group realizes that, having been through so much together, they can get through anything, despite their petty differences.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and directed by [[Tristram Shapeero]]. It premiered to acclaim from television critics.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe study group are working on their final anthropology project of the semester in the library. Troy's ([[Donald Glover]]) monkey (Annie's Boobs) steals a paintbrush and escapes into an air conditioning vent. Chang ([[Ken Jeong]]) goes into the vent and retrieves a treasure trove of the group's lost items stolen by the monkey, including Annie's ([[Alison Brie]]) pen that caused the group to get into a heated argument in \"[[Cooperative Calligraphy]]\". Some of the items remind them of their adventures throughout the year.\n\nThey realize that the year hasn't been exactly a good one, with many unfortunate events occurring. Abed ([[Danny Pudi]]) then deduces that Jeff ([[Joel McHale]]) and Britta ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) have been [[casual sex|hooking up]] secretly (since season one\u2019s \"[[Modern Warfare (Community)|Modern Warfare]]\"), which angers the group, who point out various events where the two acted selfishly to the rest of the group. The two retaliate by recalling other events where each of the rest of the group behaved unscrupulously.\n\nWhile they are arguing, Dean Pelton ([[Jim Rash]]) enters in a samba costume, at which Jeff points out the number of times he has walked in on the group in ridiculous costumes bearing irrelevant news. The Dean gets upset and leaves. Shirley ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) begs the group to stop fighting before they hurt themselves. Troy disagrees, saying that they should let it all out and never fight again. They then recall several identical instances within instances where the group argued among themselves to let it all out so that they would never fight again. Annie then concludes that the group is always fighting and will always be fighting.\n\nAs the group prepares to leave after completing the project, Jeff delivers another of his speeches, which is a montage of all the speeches he gave in the clips recalled by the group in the episode, saying that although the members of the group constantly hurt each other, \"it's just the universe's way of molding us into some kind of super group.\" Everyone hugs and makes up. The group agrees that Jeff and Britta no longer have to keep their sexual relationship a secret, causing those two to immediately decide that they aren\u2019t interested anymore.\n\n==Production==\n\"Paradigms of Human Memory\" was written by [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]], his fifth writing credit for the series.
