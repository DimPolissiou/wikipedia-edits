Its west end is at [[Bay Parkway (Brooklyn)|Bay Parkway]] and 78th Street. East of [[Ocean Avenue (Brooklyn)|Ocean Avenue]], the street is largely residential. It tracks eastward, then northeast,and for a little bit it runs parallel to brooklyn's Avenue P, then north through Brooklyn and reaches East 98th Street in central Brooklyn.At that point, it flows into Howard Avenue to provide seamless access to [[Eastern Parkway]], another major road in Brooklyn with side medians and service roads.\n\nA [[Business Improvement District]] has been established along part of the road to support stores, restaurants and businesses in that area.<ref>[http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/tag/kings-highway-business-improvement-district/ \"Kings Highway Business Improvement District\"], ''Sheepshead Bites''</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:KingsHighway1220.jpg|250px|thumb|Kings Highway entering the Flatlands section of Brooklyn]]\n[[File:Kings Highway-Coney Island Ave.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Busy intersection of Kings Highway and Coney Island Avenue. (1977)]]\n[[File:KIngsHighwaySNow.JPG|thumb|250px|Snow piles on Kings Highway]]\n[[File:Kings Hiway E14 jeh.jpg|thumb|250px|Commercial section of Kings Highway]]\n\nAlthough not entirely built in 1704, \"[[King's Highway (Charleston to Boston)|King's Highway]]\" was formed in colonial New York when the locals connected the many smaller established roads, cow paths, and Indian trails that passed through Kings County. They named the highway after the county, which was named in honor of King [[Charles II of England]] on November 1, 1683.\n\n===Original route===\nOriginally, Kings Highway was much longer than it is now. It began at Brooklyn Ferry, now called [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Ferry]], where Ferry Road, now called Old Fulton Street and Furman Street, ran southeastward to the small Dutch town of New Amersfoort, now known as [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]]. It took a sharp westward turn at that point and passed into another of Brooklyn's original six towns, [[New Utrecht, Brooklyn|New Utrecht]]. It led into Yellow Hook ([[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]]), ending at Denyse's Ferry, operated by a colonial-era landowner, about where Shore Road and 86th Street meet today. In southwest [[Brooklyn]], the thoroughfare had other names, including: \"State Road,\" \"Road from Fort Hamilton to New Utrecht,\" and \"Road from New Utrecht to Denyse's Ferry.\"\n\n====Route description====\nAccording to the Dyker Heights Historical Society, the Highway ended at the ferry landing in what is now [[Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn]]. In 1740 Denyse, a local [[New Utrecht]] resident, took over ferry operations in The Narrows, serving [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]]. Denyse\u2019s Ferry was located at the base of the hill on which [[Fort Hamilton]] was built, near today\u2019s Fort Hamilton Parkway and Shore Road. Kings Highway traveled northeast from Denyse\u2019s Ferry to present-day 86th Street. This portion of the Highway is known today as Fort Hamilton Parkway.\n\nAt the corner of Kings Highway and 86th Street stood New Utrecht Town Hall, built in 1878 (demolished in 1912). This building was also used as a school, police station, and jail. Kings Highway traveled northeast, at about a 40-degree angle to the street grid, until it reached the middle of 81st Street between Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues. At the intersection of the current-day 81st Street and Eleventh Avenue, Denyse\u2019s Lane branched off in a northwardly direction. St. Phillips Church in [[Dyker Heights]] now occupies part of the former lane, which meandered down to Van Brunt\u2019s Dock in [[Bay Ridge]]. Closer to [[Bay Ridge]], Denyse\u2019s Lane was known as Van Brunt\u2019s Lane, today's 79th Street.\n\nThe highest natural point in southwestern [[Brooklyn]] is at Eleventh Avenue and 82nd Street, at [[Dyker Heights]]. During the time of Kings Highway, the hill was known as New Utrecht Mount. According to the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]],'' it gave \u201cthe soldiers of revolutionary time an outlook from which they could note the movements of their opponents, not only as they approached from the sea, but maneuvered on Staten Island.\u201d{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} At 81st Street and Twelfth Avenue was Flax Pond. This site was filled in and developed; it is now occupied by Junior High School (JHS) 201.\n\nAfter the pond, Kings Highway traveled southeast until it reached Waters Avenue, which ran between Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues from 83rd Street until it reached the Dyker Meadows. At Fourteenth Avenue, Kings Highway meandered around the northern limits of the Dyker Meadows Swamp, which occupied much of the block between Fourteenth and Fifteenth avenues between 83rd and 84th streets. From Sixteenth Avenue to Eighteenth Avenue, Kings Highway ran on a slight diagonal; this section appears in today\u2019s street grid as 84th Street.\n\nAt Sixteenth Avenue is the cemetery where the original [[New Utrecht Reformed Church]] of 1700 stood. At Eighteenth Avenue is the church of 1828. At this 1828 church, the Highway made an abrupt 90 degree leftward turn and traveled northward one and a half blocks (as part of today\u2019s Eighteenth Avenue) until it made another abrupt 90 degree turn, this time eastward. It was built around the [[Van Pelt Manor]] House of 1686. In 1741 a Milestone was placed in front of the home to indicate the distances to [[New York City]] ({{frac|8|1|4}} miles), to Denyse\u2019s Ferry ({{frac|2|1|2}} miles), and to [[Jamaica, Queens]] (15 miles).<ref>{{cite book |author=Rosalie Fellows Bailey |title=Pre-Revolutionary Dutch houses and families in northern New Jersey and southern New York |location=New York |publisher=W. Morrow & Co.|year=1936|page=86}}</ref> Kings Highway continued east into the Town of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]]. According to the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]],'' in the 19th century, Kings Highway \u201cwas one of the best and most convenient thoroughfares for the lovers of riding and driving.\u201d{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe British General [[Lord Cornwallis]] traveled along the road with his troops on August 26, 1776, to the [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]]. He achieved a major defeat for the [[Continental Army]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. When President [[George Washington]] came to survey the agricultural abilities of [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Queens]], and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk counties]] after the war in 1792, he traveled down this rural road. Gradually, farmers moved into the area and developed their homesteads along the road.\n\n===Naming===\nThough the road was the major highway running through the towns of Brooklyn, [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]], [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] and [[New Utrecht]], it did not have a commonly used name until the 19th century, when the portion from Brooklyn Ferry to Flatbush came to be called Flatbush Road, now [[Flatbush Avenue]]. It was often referred to simply as \u201clane\u201d or \u201croad,\u201d followed by a short description. Thus it would be described as \u201cthe lane between Gravesend and New Utrecht.\u201d It also took on local names in each town, such as \u201cGravesend Lane\u201d and \u201cFerry Road.\u201d The name \u201cKings Highway\u201d was a common reference to public highways during colonial times and has been used for other roads around the New York City area that are in no way connected with the present Kings Highway.\n\n===1922 alteration===\nDespite its long history and importance as a connection through the borough of Brooklyn, in the early 1920s local city planners proposed to have the street demapped as part of an effort to regularize the [[street grid]]. Instead, it was widened in 1922, east of Ocean Avenue where park malls were created. The route was altered to straighten as many sections as possible, and to make it easy for vehicle traffic.\n\nFollowing the example of the [[parkway]]s designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] (1822\u20131903), who designed the  Eastern and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean parkways]], the boulevard malls were planted with trees to separate local and through traffic along the street. Unlike Olmsted\u2019s parkways, however, the Kings Highway malls are much narrower because existing development constrained their size; they do not provide the leisurely promenades that characterize Olmsted\u2019s work.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Kings Hwy East 16th.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kings Highway (BMT Brighton Line)]] station, early 1980s]]\n\nBus services [[B7 (New York City bus)|B7]], [[B82 (New York City bus)|B82]]/SBS, and [[B100 (New York City bus)|B100]] all run along Kings Highway.\n\nThe street is served by four [[New York City Subway]] services along three lines: \n*[[BMT Sea Beach Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Sea Beach}}), at [[Kings Highway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|West 8th Street]]\n*[[IND Culver Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Culver IND south}}), at [[Kings Highway (IND Culver Line)|McDonald Avenue]]\n*[[BMT Brighton Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Brighton}}), at [[Kings Highway (BMT Brighton Line)|East 16th Street]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Avalon Theater (Brooklyn)|Avalon Theater]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Kings Highway (Brooklyn)|Kings Highway}}\n{{Attached KML|display=title,inline}}\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=9735 Kings Highway Malls], New York City Dept. of Parks and Recreation\n* [http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/kingshwy/kingshwy.html Brooklyn's Mother Road], Forgotten New York\n\n{{Brooklyn Streets}}\n\n[[Category:Streets in Brooklyn]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Boulevard in Brooklyn, New York}}\n[[Image:KingsHighway.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A view of Kings Highway from East 16th Street in 2006.]]\n'''Kings Highway''' is a broad avenue that curves about southern part of the Borough of [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]].
