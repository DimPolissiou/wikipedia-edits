Introduced in 1963, the basic format consists of five digits. In 1983, an extended '''ZIP+4''' code was introduced; it includes the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a [[hyphen]] and four digits that designate a more specific location.\n\nThe term ''ZIP'' is an [[acronym]] for '''Zone Improvement Plan''';<ref>{{cite web |title=Flashing Across the Country: Mr. Zip and the ZIP Code Promotional Campaign |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/zipcodecampaign/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121044504/https://postalmuseum.si.edu/zipcodecampaign/ |archive-date=21 January 2012 |url-status=dead |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |access-date=22 December 2019}}</ref> it was chosen to suggest that the [[mail]] travels more efficiently and quickly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-13-006_0.pdf|title=The Untold Story of the ZIP Code|date=April 1, 2013|website=U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General|url-status=live|access-date=March 11, 2020|quote=When Day unveiled the nationwide 5-digit ZIP Code at a postmasters\u2019 convention in October of 1962, he simultaneously introduced the world to \u201cMr. ZIP\u201d \u2014 the cartoon character whose body language symbolizes speedy delivery.}}</ref> ([[wikt:zip#Verb|zipping along]]) when senders use the code in the [[Address (geography)|postal address]].

A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a [[city block]], a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|title=Organizing America: A History of the ZIP Code|last=|first=|date=25 July 2014|website=RandomHistory.com|publisher=Random History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203838/http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> In general, mail is read by a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader|multiline optical character reader]] (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific [[delivery point]]\u2014and sprays an [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\n\nFor [[Post office box|Post Office Boxes]], the general (but not invariable) rule is that each box has its own ZIP+4 code. The add-on code is often one of the following: the last four digits of the box number (e.g. PO Box 107050, Albany, NY 12201-7050), zero plus the last three digits of the box number (e.g., PO Box 17727, Eagle River, AK 99577-0727), or, if the box number consists of fewer than four digits, enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four-digit number (e.g., PO Box 77, Juneau, AK 99750-0077). However, there is no uniform rule, so the ZIP+4 Code must be looked up individually for each box{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} (e.g. using the USPS's official ZIP Code Lookup tool, and being sure to enter just city and state, not the 5-digit ZIP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input |title=ZIP Code\u2122 Lookup {{!}} USPS |website=tools.usps.com |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Postal bar code===\nThe ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort. A barcode can be printed by the sender (some word-processing programs such as [[WordPerfect]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb.iu.edu/data/aapk.html |title=Archived: How can I print routing barcodes on envelopes? - Knowledge Base |publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> include the feature), but this is not recommended, as the address-to-ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date. It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} In general, the post office uses [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] technology, though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nCustomers who send [[bulk mail]] can get a [[discounts and allowances|discount]] on [[postage]] if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail. This requires more than just a simple [[typeface|font]]; [[mailing list]]s must be standardized with up-to-date [[Coding Accuracy Support System]] (CASS)-certified software that adds and verifies a full, correct ZIP+4 Code and an additional two [[Numerical digit|digit]]s representing the exact [[delivery point]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11-digit code with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this. These steps are usually done with PAVE-certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nThe assignment of delivery point digits (the 10th and 11th digits) is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12-digit number. The delivery-point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address. The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |format=PDF |title=CASS Technical Guide |publisher=United States Postal Service |page=40 |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419090333/http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}</ref> However, when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C, often CASS will assign the same 12-digit number to two distinct mail delivery points. The last digit is always a [[check digit]], which is obtained by summing all 5, 9 or 11 digits, taking the [[modular arithmetic|residue]] modulo 10 of this sum (i.e., the remainder after dividing by 10) and finally subtracting this from 10. (Thus, the check digit for 10001-0001 00 would be 7, since 1+1+1=3, 3\u22613(mod 10) and 10\u20133=7.){{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\n==Structure and allocation==\n===Scope and international mail===\nZIP Codes designate [[delivery point]]s within the United States (and its territories). There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries, except for the independent countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and the [[Republic of Palau]], each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a [[Compact of Free Association]]. Another exception are ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of USA armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm|title=Military Addresses|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMail to [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. diplomatic missions]] overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in [[Washington, D.C.]] The four-digit [[diplomatic pouch]] number is used as a building number, while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word \"Place\" to form a street name. Each mission uses a ZIP+4 Code consisting of '''20521''' and the diplomatic pouch number. For example, the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] would be:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Embassy of the United States of America\n9000 New Delhi Place\nWashington, DC{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}20521-9000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/a/c8028.htm |title=Mail Management| publisher=Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Division of the U.S. Department of State |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nHowever, individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number. The Zip Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above. While delivered through the pouch system, mail to such addresses are not considered \"Diplomatic Pouch\" materials, and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country. An example address is:\n\n<blockquote><poem>JOHN ADAMS\nUNIT 8400 BOX 0000\nDPO AE{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}09498-0048<ref>{{cite web |title=Military & Diplomatic Mail {{!}} USPS |url=https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |website=www.usps.com |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819001108/https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |archive-date=19 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n===By type and use===\nThere are four types of ZIP Codes:\n\n* Unique: assigned to a single high-volume address\n* Post Office Box-only: used only for PO Boxes at a given facility, not for any other type of delivery\n* Military: used to route mail for the U.S. military\n* Standard: all other ZIP Codes.\n\nUnique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies, universities, businesses, or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes. Government examples include 20505 for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in Washington, D.C.; 81009 for the [[Federal Citizen Information Center]] of the [[U.S. General Services Administration]] (GSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |title=FCIC&nbsp;&ndash; About Us |publisher=Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |quote=For years, consumers have written to Pueblo, Colorado 81009 for timely, practical information they trust. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714061028/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of [[Walmart]] (72716).<!-- NOTE: Please do not add more examples; these suffice. -->\n\nAn example of a PO Box-only ZIP Code is 22313, which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], such as those used by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. In the area surrounding that post office, home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314, which is thus a Standard ZIP Code.\n\nIn certain exceptional cases, a nominally Standard-type ZIP Code may, in practice, be used as one of the three other types.  For example, the ZIP Code 43210 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] is listed as a Standard-type ZIP Code.  However, since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the [[Ohio State University]]'s main campus, it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a \"Unique\"-type ZIP Code.\n\n===By geography===\n====Primary state prefixes====\nZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of [[U.S. state]]s, the second and third digits together representing a [[region]] in that group (or perhaps a large city) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region; afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves [[Fort Campbell]], which spans [[Christian County, Kentucky]], and [[Montgomery County, Tennessee]], and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of [[Lake County, Oregon]], and [[Modoc County, California]].\n\nIn general, the first three digits designate a [[sectional center facility]], the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional center facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in [[Merrifield, Virginia|Merrifield]] is assigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in [[Oklahoma]] is assigned to [[Liberal, Kansas]]; 865 in [[Arizona]] is assigned to [[Gallup, New Mexico]]; and 961 in [[California]] to [[Reno, Nevada]].\n\nIn terms of geographic location, many of the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with&nbsp;'0', are in the [[New England]] region. Also in the '0' region are [[New Jersey]] (non-contiguous with the remainder of the '0' area), [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[APO/FPO]] military addresses for personnel stationed in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Southwest Asia]], and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code is in [[Holtsville, New York]] (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] center there).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |title=USPS Postal Facts |publisher=facts.usps.com |date=2018-02-15 |accessdate=2018-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819070643/https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |archive-date=2018-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico]]; 01001 for [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and the zip codes 01002 and 01003 for [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]; 01002 is used for mail in town, while 01003 is reserved for the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Until 2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 (located in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]) and were used by the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe numbers increase southward along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], such as 02115 ([[Boston]]), 10001 ([[New York City]]), 19103 ([[Philadelphia]]), 21201 ([[Baltimore]]), 20008 ([[Washington, D.C.]]), 30303 ([[Atlanta]]), and 33130 ([[Miami]]) (these are only examples, as each of these cities contain several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the [[Mississippi River]], southward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. For example, 40202 is in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], 50309 in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], 60601 in [[Chicago]], 63101 in [[St. Louis]], 77036 in [[Houston]], 80202 in [[Denver]], 94111 in [[San Francisco]], 98101 in [[Seattle]], and 99950 in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] (the highest ZIP Code).\n\n[[File:ZIP_Code_zones.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|ZIP Code zones in the United States]]\n\nThe first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows:\n\n* '''0''' = [[Connecticut]] (CT), [[Massachusetts]] (MA), [[Maine]] (ME), [[New Hampshire]] (NH), [[New Jersey]] (NJ), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY, [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island only]]), [[Puerto Rico]] (PR), [[Rhode Island]] (RI), [[Vermont]] (VT), [[Virgin Islands]] (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE)\n* '''1''' = [[Delaware]] (DE), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY), [[Pennsylvania]] (PA)\n* '''2''' = [[District of Columbia]] (DC), [[Maryland]] (MD), [[North Carolina]] (NC), [[South Carolina]] (SC), [[Virginia]] (VA), [[West Virginia]] (WV)\n* '''3''' = [[Alabama]] (AL), [[Florida]] (FL), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (GA), [[Mississippi]] (MS), [[Tennessee]] (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA)\n* '''4''' = [[Indiana]] (IN), [[Kentucky]] (KY), [[Michigan]] (MI), [[Ohio]] (OH)\n* '''5''' = [[Iowa]] (IA), [[Minnesota]] (MN), [[Montana]] (MT), [[North Dakota]] (ND), [[South Dakota]] (SD), [[Wisconsin]] (WI)\n* ''' 6''' = [[Illinois]] (IL), [[Kansas]] (KS), [[Missouri]] (MO), [[Nebraska]] (NE)\n* '''7''' = [[Arkansas]] (AR), [[Louisiana]] (LA), [[Oklahoma]] (OK), [[Texas]] (TX)\n* '''8''' = [[Arizona]] (AZ), [[Colorado]] (CO), [[Idaho]] (ID), [[New Mexico]] (NM), [[Nevada]] (NV), [[Utah]] (UT), [[Wyoming]] (WY)\n* ''' 9''' = [[Alaska]] (AK), [[American Samoa]] (AS), [[California]] (CA), [[Guam]] (GU), [[Hawaii]] (HI), [[Marshall Islands]] (MH), [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FM), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (MP), [[Oregon]] (OR), [[Palau]] (PW), [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (WA), Army Post Office Pacific (APO AP), Fleet Post Office Pacific (FPO AP)\n\n====Secondary regional prefixes (123xx) and local ZIP Codes (12345)====\n{{see also|List of ZIP Code prefixes}}\n[[File:10005 zip code.jpg|thumb|Early advertisement for ZIP Code 10005]]\n\nThe second and third digits represent the [[sectional center facility]] (SCF) (e.g. 477xx = [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana]]), and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city (if in a [[metropolitan area]]), or a village/town (outside metro areas), e.g. 47722 (4=Indiana, 77=Vanderburgh County, 22=[[University of Evansville]] area). When a sectional center facility's area crosses state lines, that facility is assigned separate three-digit prefixes for the states that it serves.\n\nIn some urban areas, like 462 for [[Marion County, Indiana]], the three-digit prefix will often exist in one county, while, in rural and most suburban areas, the prefix will exist in multiple counties; for example, the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties: Gibson, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh, and Warrick. In some cases, an urban county may have more than one prefix. This is the case with Allen (467, 468), Lake (464, 463), St. Joseph (465, 466), and Vanderburgh (476, 477) counties. Cities like [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] have multiple prefixes within their city limits. In some cases, these may be served from the same SCF, such as in [[San Diego County, California]], where the three-digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities, and 921 for the city of San Diego itself, although all three are processed through the same SCF facility.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nDespite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence, ZIP Code \"areas\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes ([[Rural delivery service|rural route]] areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near [[Haubstadt, Indiana]], which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring [[Fort Branch, Indiana]], while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639. Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes, often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation.\n\nAlmost all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies in and around the capital are assigned ZIP Codes starting with 20200 to 20599, which are [[Washington, D.C.]] ZIP Codes, even if they are not located in Washington itself. While the [[White House]] itself is located in ZIP Code 20006, it has the ZIP Code 20500. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is located in [[Rockville, Maryland]], at ZIP Code 20852, but has been assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20555\".\n\nIn similar manner, the ZIP Code for the [[Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority]], a federally chartered independent authority, is 20001-6000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title=Validated Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005052253/https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|archive-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> even though the physical address of the Authority's office, \"1 Aviation Circle\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Aviation+Cir,+Arlington,+VA+22202/@38.8581563,-77.0534496,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b73acf70c431:0xff2dba050678f943!8m2!3d38.8581563!4d-77.0446949|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title = Google Maps}}</ref> is in [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne current exception to this rule is the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). When the USPTO was located in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], it was assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20231\" despite being physically located in ZIP Code 22202. However, the USPTO now uses ZIP Codes assigned to its current locations in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The patents side of the USPTO uses a PO box assigned the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1450 for all postal communications.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |title=Mailing and hand carry addresses |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919203519/https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The trademarks side of the USPTO uses the same ZIP+4 code for most of its mail, but the office of the Commissioner for Trademarks has its own PO box with the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1451, and some offices within that part of the USPTO use the 22314 ZIP Code.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |title=Addressing trademark mail |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924070544/https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |archive-date=September 24, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn rare circumstances, a locality is assigned a ZIP Code that does not match the rest of the state. In even rarer cases a ZIP Code may cross state lines. Usually, this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state. Examples:\n\n* [[Fishers Island]], New York, bears the ZIP Code 06390 and is served from Connecticut because the only ferry service is to Connecticut&nbsp;\u2013 all other New York ZIP Codes (excepting those at [[Holtsville, New York|Holtsville]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]) begin with \"1\".\n* Returned government parcels from [[Washington, D.C.]] are sent to ZIP Codes beginning with \"569\" so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility (this was put into place after the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]).\n* Some Arkansas roads north of [[Bull Shoals Lake]] can best be accessed by the [[Protem, Missouri]] delivery unit (ZIP Code 65733), as they are accessible by road only through Missouri.\n* [[Fort Campbell]] (ZIP Code 42223), is primarily in Tennessee, but the main entrance is in Kentucky.\n* The [[Kentucky Bend]] geographical anomaly in far western Kentucky, where a small portion of land is separated from the rest of the state by a bend in the Mississippi river, shares ZIP Code 38079 with [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]].\n\n====Preferred place names: ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines====\n{{anchor|Zones}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n\nA ZIP Code's address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city. The Postal Service designates one ''preferred'' place name for each ZIP Code. This may be an incorporated town or city, a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated [[census-designated place]], or a small [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]]. Additional place names may be recognized as ''acceptable'' for a certain ZIP Code. Still, others are deemed not acceptable, and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery.\n\n''Preferred'' place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located. However, for many cities that have incorporated since ZIP Codes were introduced, the city name is not the ''preferred'' place name. Many databases automatically assign the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code, without regard to any ''acceptable'' place names. For example, [[Centennial, Colorado]] is divided among seven ZIP Codes assigned to [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]], or [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] as its ''preferred'' place names; none of these seven ZIP Codes carries \"Centennial\" as a preferred name, and in the ZIP Code directory, Centennial addresses are listed under those three cities. Since it is acceptable to write \"Centennial\" in conjunction with any of the seven ZIP Codes, one can write \"Centennial\" in an address in Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton, as long as it is in one of the shared ZIP Codes.\n\n''Acceptable'' place names are usually added to a ZIP Code in cases where the ZIP Code boundaries divide them between two or more cities, as in the case of Centennial. However, in many cases, only the ''preferred'' name can be used, even when many addresses in the ZIP Code are in another city. People sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city.\n\nOne extreme example is ZIP Code 85254; it was assigned the place name [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] because it is served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of [[Los Angeles]] known as [[Beverly Hills Post Office]]. Naturally, its residents prefer the more glamorous [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] address and 90210 ZIP Code, but this regularly causes problems with an emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills.\n\nSimilarly, [[Missouri City, Texas]], straddles [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend]] counties. The portion within Harris County is within the ZIP Code 77071, which must use the city name of [[Houston]] instead of Missouri City. At the same time, a small portion of the city of Houston is in Fort Bend County in the ZIP Code 77489, and residents there must use the name ''Missouri City'' for their address even though they are in Houston.\n\nThis also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices. For example, while most of the town of [[Plainfield, Massachusetts]] is in ZIP Code 01070, some sections of town are in the ZIP Code area for the neighboring town of [[Cummington, Massachusetts|Cummington]] with ZIP Code 01026. Only the ''preferred'' name of Cummington is allowed in ZIP Code 01026, so residents of parts of Plainfield must list their address as being in Cummington.\n\nThis phenomenon is repeated across the country. The previously mentioned [[Englewood, Colorado]] is an inner-ring suburb that was built out by the 1960s. Its post office served the area that is now the high-growth southern tier of the [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area|Denver metropolitan area]], and ZIP Codes in this area were assigned Englewood as their ''preferred'' place name. A business community as large as downtown [[Denver]] has grown in this area, with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations. These companies indicate Englewood as their location (the ''preferred'' postal place name), although they are located in other cities. As a result, there are really two Englewoods&nbsp;\u2013 the city, small and with a largely [[Working class|working-class]] residential population, and, a number of miles away, the postal Englewood, a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of Englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of ZIP Codes. People who say they live or work in Englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city. In [[Indiana]], the ZIP Code for a town usually indicates the ZIP Code for its corresponding township, as nearly all of Indiana's small town post offices have rural routes.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n''Acceptable'' place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular [[Urban Center|urban center]] than their own municipality. For example, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], has 130 distinct municipalities, yet many of the county's residents, and even some residents of adjacent counties, commonly use [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as their postal address. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in some urban areas, neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing, such as [[La Jolla]], [[California]], which is the ''preferred'' place name for ZIP Code 92037, despite the fact that La Jolla is a district of [[San Diego]], California and not a separate legal entity. This ZIP Code is also in the 919/920 sequence used by San Diego County's suburban and rural areas, not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the City of San Diego, even though La Jolla has always been part of San Diego.\n\nMany ZIP Codes are for [[village]]s, [[census-designated place]]s, portions of cities, or other entities that are not municipalities. For example, ZIP Code 03750 is for [[Etna, New Hampshire]], but Etna is not a city or town; it is a [[Village (New Hampshire)|village district]] in the town of [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], which itself is assigned the ZIP Code 03755. Another example is ZIP Code 08043, which corresponds to the census-designated place of [[Kirkwood, New Jersey]], but serves the entirety of [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey|Voorhees Township]]. This is also the case in [[LaGrange, New York]], a portion of which is served by the 12603 ZIP Code based in the neighboring [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]]. The rest of LaGrange is served by the LaGrangeville Post Office. LaGrangeville is itself not a town at all, but a section of LaGrange. [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]], served by the 19090 ZIP Code, is a village that straddles the border of [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] and [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], and that post office also serves a small portion of [[Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Dublin Township]]. Furthermore, non-municipal place names may also share ZIP Codes with municipal place names. For example, [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]], is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as [[Princeton Junction, New Jersey|Princeton Junction]], a census-designated place within West Windsor. [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], (20815, 20901\u201320912) is neither a city nor a town, but simply the common name for an unincorporated area consisting of a large part of the lower southern portion of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].\n\nPostal designations for place names become ''de facto'' locations for their addresses, and as a result, it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the ''preferred'' place name associated with their ZIP Codes. Because of issues of confusion and lack of identity, some cities, such as [[Signal Hill, California]], (an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] located entirely inside the separate city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]) have successfully petitioned the Postal Service to change ZIP Code boundaries or create new ZIP Codes so their cities become the ''preferred'' place name for addresses within the ZIP Code.\n\nPostal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerations.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Sometimes local officials in a community that is not the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code but is an ''acceptable'' place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community, because if the census estimate of that town's population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population. A typical example is [[Paddock Lake, Wisconsin]], whose ''preferred'' place name is [[Salem, Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Salem]]. Paddock Lake is incorporated as a village within the town of Salem, even though there are more people in the village of Paddock Lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of Salem. Further confusion is caused because [[Silver Lake, Wisconsin]], which is also a village in the town of Salem and is of similar size and status to Paddock Lake, has its own ZIP Code and post office.\n\nIn another case, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) denied a [[radio station]] (now [[WNNX (FM)|WNNX]] FM) a move requiring a change in its [[city of license]] to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], largely because it was not a city (until [[municipal incorporation]] in late 2005), despite being the seventh-largest place in the state by [[population]]. The FCC cited the use of \"[[Atlanta]]\" on letters of support from local organizations, even though the USPS forced them to use Atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect. Currently \"Sandy Springs\" is only ''acceptable'', despite none of 30328 being in Atlanta, or anywhere else outside the Sandy Springs [[city limit]]. This even applies to the ZIP Code used only for PO boxes at the Sandy Springs main post office.\n\nBecause ZIP Codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines, problems may occur where [[street address]]es are based on [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrant]] location within a county. For example, the area served by 30339 straddles the [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]]\u2013[[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] line in Georgia. The Cobb County portion of this area includes [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]] in the southeast of that county; the Fulton County portion lies within the city limits of Atlanta. Every street address in Vinings is labeled SE, and has a [[house number]] on the Cobb County grid (according to the distance from the [[town square]] in the [[county seat]] of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]). However, because the USPS demands the use of Atlanta, Vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast Atlanta, instead of in the opposite (northwest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]]) side.\n\n====Division and reallocation of ZIP Codes====\nLike [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]s, ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed, especially when a [[rural]] area becomes [[suburb]]an. Typically, the new codes become effective once announced, and a grace period (e.g., one year) is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents, order new stationery, etc.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/nyregion/21zip.html |title=An Elite ZIP Code Becomes Harder to Crack |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 21, 2007 |page= C15 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn rapidly growing communities, it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new sectional center facility was opened at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] (whose postal area includes [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]]) has its own prefix, 209, there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility.\n\nOn the other hand, [[depopulation]] may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated. For example, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]]'s ZIP Code, 17927, was retired in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Wheary |url=http://www.centraliapa.com/news.htm |title=Centralia loses its ZIP}}</ref> and ZIP Codes for [[Onoville, New York|Onoville]] (14764), [[Elko, New York|Quaker Bridge]] (14771) and [[Red House, New York|Red House]] (14773) in New York were prevented from going into use in 1964 in preparation for the [[Kinzua Dam]]'s completion.<ref name=postofficesclose>{{cite news|title=Post Offices to Close|newspaper=The Bradford Era|date=April 22, 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Final Check-Out|newspaper=Salamanca Republican-Press|date=July 1, 1964}}</ref>\n\n[[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], was originally issued the 19117 ZIP Code, although it lies in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]]. Because of the 191 prefix, which is found only in [[Philadelphia]] apart from that lone exception, auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to residents of that suburban location. For that reason, residents petitioned the USPS for a 190-prefix ZIP Code, which is common to the inner-ring Pennsylvania suburbs of that city, and, after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the USPS, Elkins Park was finally reassigned to the 19027 ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|title=All Zip Codes in Elkins Park PA|website=www.zip-codes.com|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022555/https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nZIP Codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned. For example, concurrent with the above-noted change in Montgomery County, Maryland, and under pressure from the then-mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Marion Barry]], the USPS realigned the postal boundaries between Washington, D.C. and [[Maryland]] to match the boundary. Previously, many inner suburbs, such as [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], [[Oxon Hill, Maryland|Oxon Hill]], [[Temple Hills, Maryland|Temple Hills]], [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], and [[Capitol Heights, Maryland|Capitol Heights]] had been in the Washington, D.C., postal area. As a result of the change, ZIP Codes in Maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new ZIP Codes beginning with 207, 208, or 209, depending on their location, and ZIP Codes straddling the D.C.\u2013Maryland line were split. For example, 20016 (Bethesda) became 20816, while the Maryland portion of 20012 (Takoma Park) became 20912.\n\n== Other uses ==\n=== Delivery services ===\nDelivery services other than the USPS, such as [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], and [[DHL]], require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|title=USPS.com FAQs|website=faq.usps.com|access-date=2019-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151852/https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|archive-date=2019-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{As of|October 2019}}, there are 41,702 ZIP Codes in the United States.<ref name=\"ZIP Code Database - GreatData.com\">{{Cite web|title=U.S. ZIP Code Database|url=https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|website=GreatData.com|access-date=21 October 2019|ref=ZIP Codes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019150049/https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area]]s (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau data provided by GreatData.com|url=http://greatdata.com|access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for ZIP Codes, but does not keep up-to-date datasets of all ZCTAs. Complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available. ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or ''point-based'' data, as they are assigned only at the point of delivery, not for the spaces in between the delivery points. The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons, or areal features representing the approximate extent of the ZIP Code to use for mapping and data presentation. ZCTAs are not to be confused with ZIP Codes, and they are not updated as frequently as ZIP Codes. However, for many research and planning purposes, they are very useful and can be used with ZIP Code data.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe data is often used in [[Advertising mail|direct mail marketing]] campaigns in a process called ZIP-code marketing. [[Point of sale|Point-of-sale]] cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes. Besides providing purchasing-pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments, retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer's full address and [[telephone number]]. ZIP-Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk, an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as [[redlining]]. This can cause problems, ''e.g.'', expensive insurance, for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code, while they live in a relatively crime-free town. (See Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, above.)\n\nCalifornia outlawed this practice in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | title=California high court: Retailers can not request cardholders' ZIP Code | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/10/california.credit.zip.code/index.html | last=Botelho | first=Greg | publisher=CNN | date=February 10, 2011 | access-date=February 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative districts ===\nZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts. Although the website of the [[United States House of Representatives]] has a \"Find Your Representative\" feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone, it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/|title = The United States House of Representatives \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/|title = Find Your Representative \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|title = Sunlight Foundation|date = Jan 19, 2012|access-date = Aug 6, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005420/http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|archive-date = August 13, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan [[gerrymandering]] calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Steelman |first1=Tyler |last2=Curiel |first2=John |title=Here's one way to end partisan gerrymandering: Don't break up Zip codes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/22/heres-one-way-to-end-partisan-gerrymandering-dont-break-up-zip-codes/ |website=Monkey Cage blog |publisher=Washington Post |access-date=4 November 2018 |date=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nA 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for [[routing]].<ref name=\"wilber197802\">{{Cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-02/1978_02_BYTE_03-02_Hardware_Projects#page/n15/mode/2up | title=CIE Net: A Design for a Network of Community Information Exchanges | work=BYTE | date=February 1978 | access-date=17 October 2013 | author=Wilber, Mike | page=12}}</ref>\n\nZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / [[Online locator service|store locator]] software on many [[website]]s, especially [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] websites. This software processes a user-input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States. Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized.\n\nZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary (or desirable) but the user's municipality or general location is needed. Examples (in addition to the store locator example listed above) include weather forecasts, television listings, local news, and [[Online dating service|online dating]] (most general-purpose sites, by default, search within a specified [[radius]] of a given ZIP Code, based on other users' entered ZIP Codes).\n\n=== Credit card security ===\n{{Main|Address Verification System}}\nZIP Codes are used in credit card authorization, specifically [[Address Verification System]] (AVS). When a merchant collects the entire address, the ZIP Code is an important part of AVS. In some cases, the ZIP Code is the only thing used for AVS, specifically where collecting a signature, or other information is infeasible, such as [[pay at the pump]] or [[vending machine]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[J.

The fourth and fifth digits, which give a more precise locale within the SCF, were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn, Sr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiveblog.jfklibrary.org/2015/05/papers-of-h-bentley-hahn-the-man-who-invented-the-zip-code/|title=Papers of H.

The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning. Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public (although the building may include a post office that is open to the public), and most of their employees work the [[shift work|night shift]]. Items of mail picked up at post offices are sent to their own SCFs in the afternoon, where the mail is sorted overnight.

Herb Klein, special assistant to President Nixon, responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdsun2.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19710317.1.3&srpos=&st=0&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------|title=The Cornell Daily Sun 17 March 1971 \u2014 The Cornell Daily Sun|website=cdsun2.library.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24|date=1971-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===ZIP+4===\nIn 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ''ZIP+4'', often called \"plus-four codes\", \"add-on codes\", or \"add-ons\". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a [[city block]], a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|title=Organizing America: A History of the ZIP Code|last=|first=|date=25 July 2014|website=RandomHistory.com|publisher=Random History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203838/http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> In general, mail is read by a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader|multiline optical character reader]] (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific [[delivery point]]\u2014and sprays an [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\n\nFor [[Post office box|Post Office Boxes]], the general (but not invariable) rule is that each box has its own ZIP+4 code. The add-on code is often one of the following: the last four digits of the box number (e.g. PO Box 107050, Albany, NY 12201-7050), zero plus the last three digits of the box number (e.g., PO Box 17727, Eagle River, AK 99577-0727), or, if the box number consists of fewer than four digits, enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four-digit number (e.g., PO Box 77, Juneau, AK 99750-0077). However, there is no uniform rule, so the ZIP+4 Code must be looked up individually for each box{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} (e.g. using the USPS's official ZIP Code Lookup tool, and being sure to enter just city and state, not the 5-digit ZIP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input |title=ZIP Code\u2122 Lookup {{!}} USPS |website=tools.usps.com |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Postal bar code===\nThe ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort. A barcode can be printed by the sender (some word-processing programs such as [[WordPerfect]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb.iu.edu/data/aapk.html |title=Archived: How can I print routing barcodes on envelopes? - Knowledge Base |publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> include the feature), but this is not recommended, as the address-to-ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date. It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} In general, the post office uses [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] technology, though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nCustomers who send [[bulk mail]] can get a [[discounts and allowances|discount]] on [[postage]] if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail. This requires more than just a simple [[typeface|font]]; [[mailing list]]s must be standardized with up-to-date [[Coding Accuracy Support System]] (CASS)-certified software that adds and verifies a full, correct ZIP+4 Code and an additional two [[Numerical digit|digit]]s representing the exact [[delivery point]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11-digit code with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this. These steps are usually done with PAVE-certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nThe assignment of delivery point digits (the 10th and 11th digits) is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12-digit number. The delivery-point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address. The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |format=PDF |title=CASS Technical Guide |publisher=United States Postal Service |page=40 |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419090333/http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}</ref> However, when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C, often CASS will assign the same 12-digit number to two distinct mail delivery points. The last digit is always a [[check digit]], which is obtained by summing all 5, 9 or 11 digits, taking the [[modular arithmetic|residue]] modulo 10 of this sum (i.e., the remainder after dividing by 10) and finally subtracting this from 10. (Thus, the check digit for 10001-0001 00 would be 7, since 1+1+1=3, 3\u22613(mod 10) and 10\u20133=7.){{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\n==Structure and allocation==\n===Scope and international mail===\nZIP Codes designate [[delivery point]]s within the United States (and its territories). There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries, except for the independent countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and the [[Republic of Palau]], each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a [[Compact of Free Association]]. Another exception are ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of USA armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm|title=Military Addresses|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMail to [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. diplomatic missions]] overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in [[Washington, D.C.]] The four-digit [[diplomatic pouch]] number is used as a building number, while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word \"Place\" to form a street name. Each mission uses a ZIP+4 Code consisting of '''20521''' and the diplomatic pouch number. For example, the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] would be:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Embassy of the United States of America\n9000 New Delhi Place\nWashington, DC{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}20521-9000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/a/c8028.htm |title=Mail Management| publisher=Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Division of the U.S. Department of State |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nHowever, individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number. The Zip Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above. While delivered through the pouch system, mail to such addresses are not considered \"Diplomatic Pouch\" materials, and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country. An example address is:\n\n<blockquote><poem>JOHN ADAMS\nUNIT 8400 BOX 0000\nDPO AE{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}09498-0048<ref>{{cite web |title=Military & Diplomatic Mail {{!}} USPS |url=https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |website=www.usps.com |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819001108/https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |archive-date=19 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n===By type and use===\nThere are four types of ZIP Codes:\n\n* Unique: assigned to a single high-volume address\n* Post Office Box-only: used only for PO Boxes at a given facility, not for any other type of delivery\n* Military: used to route mail for the U.S. military\n* Standard: all other ZIP Codes.\n\nUnique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies, universities, businesses, or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes. Government examples include 20505 for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in Washington, D.C.; 81009 for the [[Federal Citizen Information Center]] of the [[U.S. General Services Administration]] (GSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |title=FCIC&nbsp;&ndash; About Us |publisher=Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |quote=For years, consumers have written to Pueblo, Colorado 81009 for timely, practical information they trust. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714061028/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of [[Walmart]] (72716).<!-- NOTE: Please do not add more examples; these suffice. -->\n\nAn example of a PO Box-only ZIP Code is 22313, which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], such as those used by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. In the area surrounding that post office, home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314, which is thus a Standard ZIP Code.\n\nIn certain exceptional cases, a nominally Standard-type ZIP Code may, in practice, be used as one of the three other types.  For example, the ZIP Code 43210 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] is listed as a Standard-type ZIP Code.  However, since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the [[Ohio State University]]'s main campus, it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a \"Unique\"-type ZIP Code.\n\n===By geography===\n====Primary state prefixes====\nZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of [[U.S. state]]s, the second and third digits together representing a [[region]] in that group (or perhaps a large city) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region; afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves [[Fort Campbell]], which spans [[Christian County, Kentucky]], and [[Montgomery County, Tennessee]], and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of [[Lake County, Oregon]], and [[Modoc County, California]].\n\nIn general, the first three digits designate a [[sectional center facility]], the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional center facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in [[Merrifield, Virginia|Merrifield]] is assigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in [[Oklahoma]] is assigned to [[Liberal, Kansas]]; 865 in [[Arizona]] is assigned to [[Gallup, New Mexico]]; and 961 in [[California]] to [[Reno, Nevada]].\n\nIn terms of geographic location, many of the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with&nbsp;'0', are in the [[New England]] region. Also in the '0' region are [[New Jersey]] (non-contiguous with the remainder of the '0' area), [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[APO/FPO]] military addresses for personnel stationed in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Southwest Asia]], and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code is in [[Holtsville, New York]] (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] center there).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |title=USPS Postal Facts |publisher=facts.usps.com |date=2018-02-15 |accessdate=2018-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819070643/https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |archive-date=2018-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico]]; 01001 for [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and the zip codes 01002 and 01003 for [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]; 01002 is used for mail in town, while 01003 is reserved for the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Until 2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 (located in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]) and were used by the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe numbers increase southward along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], such as 02115 ([[Boston]]), 10001 ([[New York City]]), 19103 ([[Philadelphia]]), 21201 ([[Baltimore]]), 20008 ([[Washington, D.C.]]), 30303 ([[Atlanta]]), and 33130 ([[Miami]]) (these are only examples, as each of these cities contain several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the [[Mississippi River]], southward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. For example, 40202 is in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], 50309 in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], 60601 in [[Chicago]], 63101 in [[St. Louis]], 77036 in [[Houston]], 80202 in [[Denver]], 94111 in [[San Francisco]], 98101 in [[Seattle]], and 99950 in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] (the highest ZIP Code).\n\n[[File:ZIP_Code_zones.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|ZIP Code zones in the United States]]\n\nThe first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows:\n\n* '''0''' = [[Connecticut]] (CT), [[Massachusetts]] (MA), [[Maine]] (ME), [[New Hampshire]] (NH), [[New Jersey]] (NJ), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY, [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island only]]), [[Puerto Rico]] (PR), [[Rhode Island]] (RI), [[Vermont]] (VT), [[Virgin Islands]] (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE)\n* '''1''' = [[Delaware]] (DE), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY), [[Pennsylvania]] (PA)\n* '''2''' = [[District of Columbia]] (DC), [[Maryland]] (MD), [[North Carolina]] (NC), [[South Carolina]] (SC), [[Virginia]] (VA), [[West Virginia]] (WV)\n* '''3''' = [[Alabama]] (AL), [[Florida]] (FL), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (GA), [[Mississippi]] (MS), [[Tennessee]] (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA)\n* '''4''' = [[Indiana]] (IN), [[Kentucky]] (KY), [[Michigan]] (MI), [[Ohio]] (OH)\n* '''5''' = [[Iowa]] (IA), [[Minnesota]] (MN), [[Montana]] (MT), [[North Dakota]] (ND), [[South Dakota]] (SD), [[Wisconsin]] (WI)\n* ''' 6''' = [[Illinois]] (IL), [[Kansas]] (KS), [[Missouri]] (MO), [[Nebraska]] (NE)\n* '''7''' = [[Arkansas]] (AR), [[Louisiana]] (LA), [[Oklahoma]] (OK), [[Texas]] (TX)\n* '''8''' = [[Arizona]] (AZ), [[Colorado]] (CO), [[Idaho]] (ID), [[New Mexico]] (NM), [[Nevada]] (NV), [[Utah]] (UT), [[Wyoming]] (WY)\n* ''' 9''' = [[Alaska]] (AK), [[American Samoa]] (AS), [[California]] (CA), [[Guam]] (GU), [[Hawaii]] (HI), [[Marshall Islands]] (MH), [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FM), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (MP), [[Oregon]] (OR), [[Palau]] (PW), [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (WA), Army Post Office Pacific (APO AP), Fleet Post Office Pacific (FPO AP)\n\n====Secondary regional prefixes (123xx) and local ZIP Codes (12345)====\n{{see also|List of ZIP Code prefixes}}\n[[File:10005 zip code.jpg|thumb|Early advertisement for ZIP Code 10005]]\n\nThe second and third digits represent the [[sectional center facility]] (SCF) (e.g. 477xx = [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana]]), and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city (if in a [[metropolitan area]]), or a village/town (outside metro areas), e.g. 47722 (4=Indiana, 77=Vanderburgh County, 22=[[University of Evansville]] area). When a sectional center facility's area crosses state lines, that facility is assigned separate three-digit prefixes for the states that it serves.\n\nIn some urban areas, like 462 for [[Marion County, Indiana]], the three-digit prefix will often exist in one county, while, in rural and most suburban areas, the prefix will exist in multiple counties; for example, the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties: Gibson, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh, and Warrick. In some cases, an urban county may have more than one prefix. This is the case with Allen (467, 468), Lake (464, 463), St. Joseph (465, 466), and Vanderburgh (476, 477) counties. Cities like [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] have multiple prefixes within their city limits. In some cases, these may be served from the same SCF, such as in [[San Diego County, California]], where the three-digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities, and 921 for the city of San Diego itself, although all three are processed through the same SCF facility.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nDespite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence, ZIP Code \"areas\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes ([[Rural delivery service|rural route]] areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near [[Haubstadt, Indiana]], which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring [[Fort Branch, Indiana]], while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639. Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes, often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation.\n\nAlmost all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies in and around the capital are assigned ZIP Codes starting with 20200 to 20599, which are [[Washington, D.C.]] ZIP Codes, even if they are not located in Washington itself. While the [[White House]] itself is located in ZIP Code 20006, it has the ZIP Code 20500. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is located in [[Rockville, Maryland]], at ZIP Code 20852, but has been assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20555\".\n\nIn similar manner, the ZIP Code for the [[Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority]], a federally chartered independent authority, is 20001-6000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title=Validated Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005052253/https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|archive-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> even though the physical address of the Authority's office, \"1 Aviation Circle\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Aviation+Cir,+Arlington,+VA+22202/@38.8581563,-77.0534496,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b73acf70c431:0xff2dba050678f943!8m2!3d38.8581563!4d-77.0446949|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title = Google Maps}}</ref> is in [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne current exception to this rule is the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).

In even rarer cases a ZIP Code may cross state lines. Usually, this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state. Examples:\n\n* [[Fishers Island]], New York, bears the ZIP Code 06390 and is served from Connecticut because the only ferry service is to Connecticut&nbsp;\u2013 all other New York ZIP Codes (excepting those at [[Holtsville, New York|Holtsville]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]) begin with \"1\".\n* Returned government parcels from [[Washington, D.C.]] are sent to ZIP Codes beginning with \"569\" so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility (this was put into place after the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]).\n* Some Arkansas roads north of [[Bull Shoals Lake]] can best be accessed by the [[Protem, Missouri]] delivery unit (ZIP Code 65733), as they are accessible by road only through Missouri.\n* [[Fort Campbell]] (ZIP Code 42223), is primarily in Tennessee, but the main entrance is in Kentucky.\n* The [[Kentucky Bend]] geographical anomaly in far western Kentucky, where a small portion of land is separated from the rest of the state by a bend in the Mississippi river, shares ZIP Code 38079 with [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]].\n\n====Preferred place names: ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines====\n{{anchor|Zones}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n\nA ZIP Code's address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city. The Postal Service designates one ''preferred'' place name for each ZIP Code. This may be an incorporated town or city, a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated [[census-designated place]], or a small [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]]. Additional place names may be recognized as ''acceptable'' for a certain ZIP Code. Still, others are deemed not acceptable, and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery.\n\n''Preferred'' place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located. However, for many cities that have incorporated since ZIP Codes were introduced, the city name is not the ''preferred'' place name. Many databases automatically assign the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code, without regard to any ''acceptable'' place names. For example, [[Centennial, Colorado]] is divided among seven ZIP Codes assigned to [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]], or [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] as its ''preferred'' place names; none of these seven ZIP Codes carries \"Centennial\" as a preferred name, and in the ZIP Code directory, Centennial addresses are listed under those three cities. Since it is acceptable to write \"Centennial\" in conjunction with any of the seven ZIP Codes, one can write \"Centennial\" in an address in Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton, as long as it is in one of the shared ZIP Codes.\n\n''Acceptable'' place names are usually added to a ZIP Code in cases where the ZIP Code boundaries divide them between two or more cities, as in the case of Centennial. However, in many cases, only the ''preferred'' name can be used, even when many addresses in the ZIP Code are in another city. People sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city.\n\nOne extreme example is ZIP Code 85254; it was assigned the place name [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] because it is served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of [[Los Angeles]] known as [[Beverly Hills Post Office]]. Naturally, its residents prefer the more glamorous [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] address and 90210 ZIP Code, but this regularly causes problems with an emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills.\n\nSimilarly, [[Missouri City, Texas]], straddles [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend]] counties. The portion within Harris County is within the ZIP Code 77071, which must use the city name of [[Houston]] instead of Missouri City. At the same time, a small portion of the city of Houston is in Fort Bend County in the ZIP Code 77489, and residents there must use the name ''Missouri City'' for their address even though they are in Houston.\n\nThis also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices. For example, while most of the town of [[Plainfield, Massachusetts]] is in ZIP Code 01070, some sections of town are in the ZIP Code area for the neighboring town of [[Cummington, Massachusetts|Cummington]] with ZIP Code 01026. Only the ''preferred'' name of Cummington is allowed in ZIP Code 01026, so residents of parts of Plainfield must list their address as being in Cummington.\n\nThis phenomenon is repeated across the country. The previously mentioned [[Englewood, Colorado]] is an inner-ring suburb that was built out by the 1960s. Its post office served the area that is now the high-growth southern tier of the [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area|Denver metropolitan area]], and ZIP Codes in this area were assigned Englewood as their ''preferred'' place name. A business community as large as downtown [[Denver]] has grown in this area, with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations. These companies indicate Englewood as their location (the ''preferred'' postal place name), although they are located in other cities. As a result, there are really two Englewoods&nbsp;\u2013 the city, small and with a largely [[Working class|working-class]] residential population, and, a number of miles away, the postal Englewood, a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of Englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of ZIP Codes. People who say they live or work in Englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city. In [[Indiana]], the ZIP Code for a town usually indicates the ZIP Code for its corresponding township, as nearly all of Indiana's small town post offices have rural routes.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n''Acceptable'' place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular [[Urban Center|urban center]] than their own municipality. For example, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], has 130 distinct municipalities, yet many of the county's residents, and even some residents of adjacent counties, commonly use [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as their postal address. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in some urban areas, neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing, such as [[La Jolla]], [[California]], which is the ''preferred'' place name for ZIP Code 92037, despite the fact that La Jolla is a district of [[San Diego]], California and not a separate legal entity. This ZIP Code is also in the 919/920 sequence used by San Diego County's suburban and rural areas, not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the City of San Diego, even though La Jolla has always been part of San Diego.\n\nMany ZIP Codes are for [[village]]s, [[census-designated place]]s, portions of cities, or other entities that are not municipalities. For example, ZIP Code 03750 is for [[Etna, New Hampshire]], but Etna is not a city or town; it is a [[Village (New Hampshire)|village district]] in the town of [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], which itself is assigned the ZIP Code 03755. Another example is ZIP Code 08043, which corresponds to the census-designated place of [[Kirkwood, New Jersey]], but serves the entirety of [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey|Voorhees Township]]. This is also the case in [[LaGrange, New York]], a portion of which is served by the 12603 ZIP Code based in the neighboring [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]]. The rest of LaGrange is served by the LaGrangeville Post Office. LaGrangeville is itself not a town at all, but a section of LaGrange. [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]], served by the 19090 ZIP Code, is a village that straddles the border of [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] and [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], and that post office also serves a small portion of [[Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Dublin Township]]. Furthermore, non-municipal place names may also share ZIP Codes with municipal place names. For example, [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]], is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as [[Princeton Junction, New Jersey|Princeton Junction]], a census-designated place within West Windsor. [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], (20815, 20901\u201320912) is neither a city nor a town, but simply the common name for an unincorporated area consisting of a large part of the lower southern portion of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].\n\nPostal designations for place names become ''de facto'' locations for their addresses, and as a result, it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the ''preferred'' place name associated with their ZIP Codes. Because of issues of confusion and lack of identity, some cities, such as [[Signal Hill, California]], (an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] located entirely inside the separate city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]) have successfully petitioned the Postal Service to change ZIP Code boundaries or create new ZIP Codes so their cities become the ''preferred'' place name for addresses within the ZIP Code.\n\nPostal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerations.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Sometimes local officials in a community that is not the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code but is an ''acceptable'' place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community, because if the census estimate of that town's population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population. A typical example is [[Paddock Lake, Wisconsin]], whose ''preferred'' place name is [[Salem, Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Salem]]. Paddock Lake is incorporated as a village within the town of Salem, even though there are more people in the village of Paddock Lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of Salem. Further confusion is caused because [[Silver Lake, Wisconsin]], which is also a village in the town of Salem and is of similar size and status to Paddock Lake, has its own ZIP Code and post office.\n\nIn another case, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) denied a [[radio station]] (now [[WNNX (FM)|WNNX]] FM) a move requiring a change in its [[city of license]] to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], largely because it was not a city (until [[municipal incorporation]] in late 2005), despite being the seventh-largest place in the state by [[population]]. The FCC cited the use of \"[[Atlanta]]\" on letters of support from local organizations, even though the USPS forced them to use Atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect. Currently \"Sandy Springs\" is only ''acceptable'', despite none of 30328 being in Atlanta, or anywhere else outside the Sandy Springs [[city limit]]. This even applies to the ZIP Code used only for PO boxes at the Sandy Springs main post office.\n\nBecause ZIP Codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines, problems may occur where [[street address]]es are based on [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrant]] location within a county. For example, the area served by 30339 straddles the [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]]\u2013[[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] line in Georgia. The Cobb County portion of this area includes [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]] in the southeast of that county; the Fulton County portion lies within the city limits of Atlanta. Every street address in Vinings is labeled SE, and has a [[house number]] on the Cobb County grid (according to the distance from the [[town square]] in the [[county seat]] of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]). However, because the USPS demands the use of Atlanta, Vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast Atlanta, instead of in the opposite (northwest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]]) side.\n\n====Division and reallocation of ZIP Codes====\nLike [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]s, ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed, especially when a [[rural]] area becomes [[suburb]]an. Typically, the new codes become effective once announced, and a grace period (e.g., one year) is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents, order new stationery, etc.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/nyregion/21zip.html |title=An Elite ZIP Code Becomes Harder to Crack |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 21, 2007 |page= C15 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn rapidly growing communities, it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new sectional center facility was opened at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] (whose postal area includes [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]]) has its own prefix, 209, there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility.\n\nOn the other hand, [[depopulation]] may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated. For example, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]]'s ZIP Code, 17927, was retired in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Wheary |url=http://www.centraliapa.com/news.htm |title=Centralia loses its ZIP}}</ref> and ZIP Codes for [[Onoville, New York|Onoville]] (14764), [[Elko, New York|Quaker Bridge]] (14771) and [[Red House, New York|Red House]] (14773) in New York were prevented from going into use in 1964 in preparation for the [[Kinzua Dam]]'s completion.<ref name=postofficesclose>{{cite news|title=Post Offices to Close|newspaper=The Bradford Era|date=April 22, 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Final Check-Out|newspaper=Salamanca Republican-Press|date=July 1, 1964}}</ref>\n\n[[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], was originally issued the 19117 ZIP Code, although it lies in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]]. Because of the 191 prefix, which is found only in [[Philadelphia]] apart from that lone exception, auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to residents of that suburban location. For that reason, residents petitioned the USPS for a 190-prefix ZIP Code, which is common to the inner-ring Pennsylvania suburbs of that city, and, after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the USPS, Elkins Park was finally reassigned to the 19027 ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|title=All Zip Codes in Elkins Park PA|website=www.zip-codes.com|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022555/https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nZIP Codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned. For example, concurrent with the above-noted change in Montgomery County, Maryland, and under pressure from the then-mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Marion Barry]], the USPS realigned the postal boundaries between Washington, D.C. and [[Maryland]] to match the boundary. Previously, many inner suburbs, such as [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], [[Oxon Hill, Maryland|Oxon Hill]], [[Temple Hills, Maryland|Temple Hills]], [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], and [[Capitol Heights, Maryland|Capitol Heights]] had been in the Washington, D.C., postal area. As a result of the change, ZIP Codes in Maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new ZIP Codes beginning with 207, 208, or 209, depending on their location, and ZIP Codes straddling the D.C.\u2013Maryland line were split. For example, 20016 (Bethesda) became 20816, while the Maryland portion of 20012 (Takoma Park) became 20912.\n\n== Other uses ==\n=== Delivery services ===\nDelivery services other than the USPS, such as [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], and [[DHL]], require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|title=USPS.com FAQs|website=faq.usps.com|access-date=2019-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151852/https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|archive-date=2019-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{As of|October 2019}}, there are 41,702 ZIP Codes in the United States.<ref name=\"ZIP Code Database - GreatData.com\">{{Cite web|title=U.S. ZIP Code Database|url=https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|website=GreatData.com|access-date=21 October 2019|ref=ZIP Codes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019150049/https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area]]s (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau data provided by GreatData.com|url=http://greatdata.com|access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for ZIP Codes, but does not keep up-to-date datasets of all ZCTAs. Complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available. ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or ''point-based'' data, as they are assigned only at the point of delivery, not for the spaces in between the delivery points. The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons, or areal features representing the approximate extent of the ZIP Code to use for mapping and data presentation. ZCTAs are not to be confused with ZIP Codes, and they are not updated as frequently as ZIP Codes. However, for many research and planning purposes, they are very useful and can be used with ZIP Code data.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe data is often used in [[Advertising mail|direct mail marketing]] campaigns in a process called ZIP-code marketing. [[Point of sale|Point-of-sale]] cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes. Besides providing purchasing-pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments, retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer's full address and [[telephone number]]. ZIP-Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk, an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as [[redlining]]. This can cause problems, ''e.g.'', expensive insurance, for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code, while they live in a relatively crime-free town. (See Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, above.)\n\nCalifornia outlawed this practice in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | title=California high court: Retailers can not request cardholders' ZIP Code | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/10/california.credit.zip.code/index.html | last=Botelho | first=Greg | publisher=CNN | date=February 10, 2011 | access-date=February 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative districts ===\nZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts. Although the website of the [[United States House of Representatives]] has a \"Find Your Representative\" feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone, it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/|title = The United States House of Representatives \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/|title = Find Your Representative \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|title = Sunlight Foundation|date = Jan 19, 2012|access-date = Aug 6, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005420/http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|archive-date = August 13, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan [[gerrymandering]] calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Steelman |first1=Tyler |last2=Curiel |first2=John |title=Here's one way to end partisan gerrymandering: Don't break up Zip codes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/22/heres-one-way-to-end-partisan-gerrymandering-dont-break-up-zip-codes/ |website=Monkey Cage blog |publisher=Washington Post |access-date=4 November 2018 |date=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nA 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for [[routing]].<ref name=\"wilber197802\">{{Cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-02/1978_02_BYTE_03-02_Hardware_Projects#page/n15/mode/2up | title=CIE Net: A Design for a Network of Community Information Exchanges | work=BYTE | date=February 1978 | access-date=17 October 2013 | author=Wilber, Mike | page=12}}</ref>\n\nZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / [[Online locator service|store locator]] software on many [[website]]s, especially [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] websites. This software processes a user-input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States. Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized.\n\nZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary (or desirable) but the user's municipality or general location is needed. Examples (in addition to the store locator example listed above) include weather forecasts, television listings, local news, and [[Online dating service|online dating]] (most general-purpose sites, by default, search within a specified [[radius]] of a given ZIP Code, based on other users' entered ZIP Codes).\n\n=== Credit card security ===\n{{Main|Address Verification System}}\nZIP Codes are used in credit card authorization, specifically [[Address Verification System]] (AVS). When a merchant collects the entire address, the ZIP Code is an important part of AVS. In some cases, the ZIP Code is the only thing used for AVS, specifically where collecting a signature, or other information is infeasible, such as [[pay at the pump]] or [[vending machine]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[J.

primary product\n\n=== Script storage ===\n* Some products are only capable of starting a script or executable which is already present on the target system. Eventually some environment variables are set prior to the script run.\n* Some products are able to store scripts in their repository. When the job runs, its script is first transferred to the target system and then executed. This gives the batch job designer a central point of development.\n\n=== Event driven ===\n* Most modern job schedulers are event driven: jobs that run in sequence have no wait time.\n* The opposite is time driven, like Windows' Scheduled tasks or Unix' crontab: a job runs at some time, and the next job is scheduled the expected runtime later plus some spare time.\n\n=== Agents ===\n* An agentless job scheduler makes use of RSH, or more secure, of SSH.\n* An agent is a piece of software that is installed on every host, and is usually continuously connected to the central job scheduler. This causes more functionality to the agents, like a file trigger.\n* A drawback of agents is that they must be upgraded from time to time, which can cause downtime during upgrades.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAll kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as \"Unix\". The same goes for \"Linux\" and \"Windows\" and Mac.\n\n=== Any OS account ===\nCan the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.\n\n=== stdout/err transfer ===\nCan you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.\n\n=== File events ===\nCan the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.\n\n=== File transfer ===\nSome vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the servers will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.\n\n=== ERP support ===\nThe list of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages supported.\n\n=== SAP XBP version ===\nThe SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.\n\n=== Role-based security ===\nIs it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.\n\n=== Auditing ===\nSome companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.\n\n=== Design lifecycle ===\nDoes the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.\n\n=== User Interfaces ===\nLists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quartz (scheduler)|Quartz]] - open-source job scheduling service, for Java. It exists also as a port to .NET.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Job scheduling|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2018}}\n\nThis is a list of notable '''job scheduler software'''.  [[Job scheduler|Job scheduling applications]] are designed to carry out repetitive tasks as defined in a schedule based upon calendar and event conditions.

{"title_page": "Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire", "text_new": "{{More references|date=August 2018}} \n'''Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire''' was a [[Political economy|politico-economic]] system of relationships between [[liege lord]]s and enfeoffed [[vassal]]s (or feudatories) that formed the basis of the [[social structure]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[High Middle Ages]]. In Germany the system is variously referred to ''Lehnswesen'', ''Feudalwesen'' or ''Benefizialwesen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nFeudalism in Europe emerged in the Early Middle Ages, based on [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Roman clientship]] and the [[Germanic peoples#Culture|Germanic social hierarchy]] of lords and retainers.  It obliged the [[feudatory]] to render personal services to the lord. These included e.&nbsp;g. holding his stirrup, joining him on festive occasions and service as a [[cupbearer]] at the banquet table. Both pledged mutual [[loyalty]]: the lord to \"shelter and protect\", the vassal to \"help and advise\". Furthermore, feudal lord and vassal were bound to mutually respect one another, e.g. the lord could not, by law, beat his vassal, humiliate or lay hands on his wife or daughter.<!-- German Wikipedia has \"daughter\" not \"children\"; presumably this refers to protection from sexist behaviour or sexual predation. -->{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe highest liege lord was the sovereign, the [[king]] or [[duke]], who granted [[fief]]s to his [[prince]]s. In turn, they could award fiefs to other [[nobility|nobles]], who wanted to be [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] by them and who were often subordinate to the liege lord in the aristocratic hierarchy.\n\n== Terms ==\n[[File:Lehensurkunde G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen Burg Hornberg.jpg|thumb|[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] was enfeoffed with [[Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern)|Hornberg Castle]] in this deed]]\nA [[fief]] (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, '''''{{lang-de|Lehen}}''''', {{lang-lat|feudum}}, ''feodum'' or ''beneficium'') was understood to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (''Lehnsherr''), had transferred to the hereditary [[ownership]] of the beneficiary on the basis of mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.\n\nEnfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary [[usufruct]] of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word ''beneficum'' implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the ''feodum'' - but also the associated legal relationship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe owner was the so-called liege lord or feudal lord (German: '''''Lehnsherr''''' ''Lehnsgeber''; Latin: ''[[Dominium|dominus]] feudi'', ''senior''), who was usually the [[territorial lord]] or reigning monarch. The beneficiary was his vassal, liegeman or feudatory (German: '''''Vasall''''', ''[[Lehnsmann]]'', ''[[Knecht]]'', ''Lehenempf\u00e4nger'' or ''Lehenstr\u00e4ger''; Latin: ''vassus'' or ''vasallus''). Both parties swore an [[oath of fealty]] ('''''[[Lehnseid]]''''') to one another. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').\n\nThe fief (German: ''Lehen'' or '''''Lehnsgut''''') usually comprised an estate or a complex of estates, but also specified rights of use and rights of taxation or duties.\n\nLinguistically the term ''Lehen'' is connected with the word ''leihen'', to lend or loan, and meant something like \"loaned property\" (c.f. the modern German ''Darlehen'', a loan), whilst the word ''feudum'', which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin ''fides'' (loyalty), is more likely to be derived from the [[Old High German]] ''fihu'', ''fehu'' (whence modern ''Vieh''), originally \"cattle\", but later generally \"chattel\".\n\nThe opposite of a fief was the freehold, [[allod]] or ''allodium'', which roughly corresponds to the present freehold estate.\n\nAn institution during the transition from feudal states to what is now the free ownership of property, was the ''allodifizierte Lehen'' (\"allodified fief\"), a fief in which the feudal lord gave up direct ownership - usually in return for the payment of compensation or an allodified rent (''Allodifikationsrenten'') - but the vassal's ownership of the fief with an agreed agnatic succession - resembling a family [[entailed estate]] (''Familienfideikommi\u00df'') - remained in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Types ===\nThere were numerous different types of feudal arrangement depending on regional tradition and the nature of feudal lordship (secular or ecclesiastical/monastic). The best-known of these were:\n\n* '''''[[Afterlehen]]:''''' A subfief whereby the vassal awarded a part of his fief to a third party (subinfeudation)\n* '''''Altarlehen:''''' A medieval proto-foundation (''proto-Stiftung'').  Its purpose was to allocate annual revenue from the property to a specific primate for his abbey or church\n* '''''Beutellehen:''''' originally a ''Ritterlehen'' that was later rented to farmers\n* '''''[[Burglehn]]:''''' a fief in payment for services as a [[castellan]] (''[[Burgmann]]'')\n* '''''Erblehen:''''' a fee tail (entail) where the heirs of the vassal automatically inherited his rights and duties. The fief only first became hereditary through the granting of a deed of entail (''Erbrechtsbrief'') from the liege lord\n* '''''Fahnlehen:''''' (\"banner fief\"<ref name=\"Stieber\">Stieber, Joachim. W. (1978). ''Pope Eugenius IV, the Council of Basel and the Secular and Ecclesiastical Authorities in the Empire'', E.J. Brill, Leiden, p. 124. {{ISBN|90-04-05240-2}}</ref>) a fief to a secular prince, in which banners symbolised the fief and the duties to the [[Heerbann]].\n* '''''Falllehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. See ''Schupflehen''\n* '''''Freistift:''''' a fief that could be cancelled at 12 months notice\n* '''''Handlehen:''''' a fief awarded for a specified period or the life of the vassal. Originally: a fief sealed by a handshake instead of a formal oath of fealty.\n* '''''Kunkellehen:'''''  a fief to a vassal who was a woman (also called a ''Weiberlehen'' or ''feudum femininum'')\n* '''''Mannlehen/Mannslehen:''''' a fief to a vassal who had to be a man\n* '''''ligisches Lehnswesen:''''' a fief in which the vassal was excluded from holding fiefs from other lords through a stronger contract between lord and vassal\n* '''''Schildlehen:''''' similar to ''Fahnenlehen'', but where the vassal held the rank of count or lower\n* '''''Schupflehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal.

The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers. There were no feudal relationships between farmers and the lower vassals.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages another structure developed in Germany, the so-called ''[[Heerschild]]ordnung'', a medieval feudal hierarchy:\n\n* King (''K\u00f6nig'')\n* Ecclesiastical princes (''Geistliche F\u00fcrsten'')\n* Secular, or lay, princes (''Weltliche F\u00fcrsten'')\n* Counts and barons (''Grafen und Freiherren'')\n* [[Ministeriales]] (''Ministerialen'' or ''Dienstmannen'')\n* Vassals of the ministeriales (''M\u00e4nner der Ministerialen'')\n* Free knights (''Ritterb\u00fcrtige Mannen'') (who could only receive a fief, not grant one)\n\nInitially, only those of knightly birth were entitled to be enfeoffed, i.e. free knights who could bear arms and were in full possession of their title.

From court service, the state and imperial diets emerged. The fief was only given to the vassal to utilize; later, the vassal also became a sub-owner, but the feudal lord always retained the rights to this office. Eventually, the heritability of fiefs evolved later, but the landowner nevertheless remained the liege lord.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Roots of feudalism ==\n\n=== Roman patronage ===\n{{main|Patronage in ancient Rome}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]], out of the Roman system of patronage (or clientage) and the clan (''[[Sippe]]'') relationships of the [[Migration Period]] (''V\u00f6lkerwanderungszeit'') (Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil), relations between rulers and their subjects developed into a prevailing consensus that was commonplace and accepted.\n\nIn Roman culture, it was common for a patron (a wealthy Roman citizen) to automatically retain his freed [[slave]]s in a dependent relationship, known as patronage. In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.\n\nIn return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.\n\nIn Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (''[[Latifundia]]'') as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.\n \nClients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.\n\n=== Germanic clan system ===\nDuring the latter years of the period of [[Sippe|clan society]] with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the [[king]]. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only ''in persona''. On the death of king or vassal, the land was [[de facto]] returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person [[enfeoffed]] with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the [[fief]] and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (''Lehnseid''), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of [[enfeoffment]].\n\nThe vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.\n\nThe Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or ''Lehnsrecht'', a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.\n\nThe enforcement of ''Lehnsrecht'' is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods. [[Money]] could not bind a [[vassal]] to a king, only land. Unlike money, this was plentiful.\n\nEven kings (see [[Richard the Lionheart]] - compulsory allegiance) and at least in the early Middle Ages, the [[clergy]] (see [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]]-[[Salian dynasty|Salian]] [[imperial church]] system) could be vassals of a king or another king.\n\n=== Emergence of feudal relationships ===\n[[File:Lehnseid.png|thumb|Acceptain of the oath of fealty (''Lehnseid'') in 1512]]\nUnder the feudal system, various legal institutions came together during the [[Carolingian period]] that had previously existed independently. These institutions were:\n* The ''[[antrustiones]]'' - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual [[weregild]] had to be paid to them.\n* The ''vassi'' - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to [[commend]] themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]] ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called ''handgang'' ceremony, i.e. the future ''vassus'' put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.\n* The ''beneficium'' (original meaning of \"benefit\") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.\n\nIt was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.\nThe ''handgang'', which together with the oath of loyalty (''Treueid''), became referred to as ''homagium'' (Latin), ''homage'' (French), or ''mannschaft'' (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the ''handgang'' dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.\n\n[[Commendation ceremony|Commendation]]s were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the [[manorial]] system (''Grundherrschaft''), at the high levels on feudalism (''Lehnswesen'').\n\nThe award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the [[monetary system]] necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.\n\n=== Subsequent development ===\nAs the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. <!-- (see [[Personenverbandsstaat]]) -->\n\nIt was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as ''Afterlehen'' to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by [[Conrad II (HRR)|Conrad II]] in the ''[[constitutio de feudis]]''. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.\n\nWithin each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (''Vassallen''), liegemen (''Dienstmannen'') - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the [[university]] system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened [[territorial lordship]] (''Landesherrschaft''), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.\n\nIn England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (''Lehnsverband'') was a long process. Legally, it was abolished ''inter alia'' by the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] acts, in the [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation]] and the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as G\u00f6rtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at [[Bad Salzschlirf|Salzschlirf]] and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an [[Allied Control Council]] edict.\n\n== Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire ==\nIn general, the vassal (''Lehnsmann'') was granted land or [[Freihaus|free houses]] (''Freih\u00e4user'') in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called ''servi non cassati'' were given a fief as soon as one became available.\n\nOfficial positions (''\u00c4mter'') and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal [[regalia]]) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the [[House of Thurn and Taxis]] received its '''''Postlehen''''' or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (''[[Stift]]e'' or ''feudal ecclesiastica'') and enfeoffments of [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s associated with an [[altar]] (''feudum altaragli''). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.\n\n=== Feoffment ===\nFeoffment (''constitutio feudi, infeudatio'') involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a [[commendation ceremony]]. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (''Handgang''):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an [[oath of allegiance]], which was usually sworn on a religious [[relic]]. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.\n\nIn the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (''homagium'' or ''Mannschaft''), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as [[livery of seizin]] and could be a staff or a banner (called a ''Fahnenlehn''). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called ''Zepterlehen''). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.\n\nThe fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (''Lehnsauftragung'') and then received it back as a fief ([[Oblation (legal)|''oblatio feudi'']]). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.\n\n=== Legal relationship between lords and vassals ===\nFrom the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as ''auxilium et consilium'' (help and advice). ''Auxilium'' usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. ''Consilium'' meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or ''[[Hoftag]]e''. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.\n\nThe vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the [[accolade]] of his eldest son, for the [[dowry]] of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the [[Holy Land]].\n\nThe feudal lord could also demand recompense (''Lehnserneuerung'' or ''renovatio investiturae'') from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as ''Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall'') - as well as changes of vassal (known as ''Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall'' or ''Mannfall, Nebenfall''). The latter had to submit a written application (''Lehnsmutung'') within a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]] (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (''Lehnsindult'').\n\nDepending on [[local law]], the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the ''Schreibschilling'' or ''Lehnstaxe''), to pay a special tax (the ''Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware'' or ''Handlohn''). Finally, in the event of a [[felony]] by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called ''Privationsklage'' action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.\n\nThe duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (''Lehnsprotektion'') and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the \"right of use\" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  ''Lehnsobjekt''). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.\n\n=== Dissolution of a feudal relationship ===\nOriginally, a lord-vassal tie (''Lehnsbindung'') was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (''Lehnsmann'') considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.\n\n[[File:Seegr\u00e4ben IMG 3630.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Lehenhof'' built in 1710 in [[Seegr\u00e4ben]], Switzerland]]\n\n== Summary ==\nIn summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.\n\nPersonal element:\nThe lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty. The visible expression of this commitment was the act of the vassal placing his hands in those of his lord (''handgang'' - comparable with today's handshake, except that the ''handgang'' symbolized a hierarchical relation).\n\nMaterial element:\nBased on the pledge of loyalty between them, the lord made land available to the vassal. The vassal was obliged, in return, to render various services and taxes.\n\n== Family, house and place names ==\nAn echo of the old feudal system in Europe is found in family names such as [[Lehner]], Lechner, Lehmann, Lehle, Horrigan and Lenherr as well as in numerous house and even place names, that even today have the term ''Lehen'' in the names (see a list at [[Lehen (disambiguation)]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Feudalism]]\n* [[Feudal law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Marc Bloch]]: ''Die Feudalgesellschaft'', durchgesehene Neuausgabe, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart, 1999, {{ISBN|3-608-91234-7}}.\n* J\u00fcrgen Dendorfer / Roman Deutinger (ed.): ''Das Lehnswesen im Hochmittelalter.

In Germany the system is variously referred to ''Lehnswesen'', ''Feudalwesen'' or ''Benefizialwesen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nFeudalism in Europe emerged in the Early Middle Ages, based on [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Roman clientship]] and the [[Germanic peoples#Culture|Germanic social hierarchy]] of lords and retainers.  It obliged the [[feudatory]] to render personal services to the lord. These included e.&nbsp;g. holding his stirrup, joining him on festive occasions and service as a [[cupbearer]] at the banquet table. Both pledged mutual [[loyalty]]: the lord to \"shelter and protect\", the vassal to \"help and advise\". Furthermore, feudal lord and vassal were bound to mutually respect one another, i.e. the lord could not, by law, beat his vassal, humiliate or lay hands on his wife or daughter.<!-- German Wikipedia has \"daughter\" not \"children\"; presumably this refers to protection from sexist behaviour or sexual predation. -->{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe highest liege lord was the sovereign, the [[king]] or [[duke]], who granted [[fief]]s to his [[prince]]s. In turn, they could award fiefs to other [[nobility|nobles]], who wanted to be [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] by them and who were often subordinate to the liege lord in the aristocratic hierarchy.\n\n== Terms ==\n[[File:Lehensurkunde G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen Burg Hornberg.jpg|thumb|[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] was enfeoffed with [[Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern)|Hornberg Castle]] in this deed]]\nA [[fief]] (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, '''''{{lang-de|Lehen}}''''', {{lang-lat|feudum}}, ''feodum'' or ''beneficium'') was understood to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (''Lehnsherr''), had transferred to the hereditary [[ownership]] of the beneficiary on the basis of mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.\n\nEnfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary [[usufruct]] of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word ''beneficum'' implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the ''feodum'' - but also the associated legal relationship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe owner was the so-called liege lord or feudal lord (German: '''''Lehnsherr''''' ''Lehnsgeber''; Latin: ''[[Dominium|dominus]] feudi'', ''senior''), who was usually the [[territorial lord]] or reigning monarch. The beneficiary was his vassal, liegeman or feudatory (German: '''''Vasall''''', ''[[Lehnsmann]]'', ''[[Knecht]]'', ''Lehenempf\u00e4nger'' or ''Lehenstr\u00e4ger''; Latin: ''vassus'' or ''vasallus''). Both parties swore an [[oath of fealty]] ('''''[[Lehnseid]]''''') to one another. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').\n\nThe fief (German: ''Lehen'' or '''''Lehnsgut''''') usually comprised an estate or a complex of estates, but also specified rights of use and rights of taxation or duties.\n\nLinguistically the term ''Lehen'' is connected with the word ''leihen'', to lend or loan, and meant something like \"loaned property\" (c.f. the modern German ''Darlehen'', a loan), whilst the word ''feudum'', which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin ''fides'' (loyalty), is more likely to be derived from the [[Old High German]] ''fihu'', ''fehu'' (whence modern ''Vieh''), originally \"cattle\", but later generally \"chattel\".\n\nThe opposite of a fief was the freehold, [[allod]] or ''allodium'', which roughly corresponds to the present freehold estate.\n\nAn institution during the transition from feudal states to what is now the free ownership of property, was the ''allodifizierte Lehen'' (\"allodified fief\"), a fief in which the feudal lord gave up direct ownership - usually in return for the payment of compensation or an allodified rent (''Allodifikationsrenten'') - but the vassal's ownership of the fief with an agreed agnatic succession - resembling a family [[entailed estate]] (''Familienfideikommi\u00df'') - remained in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Types ===\nThere were numerous different types of feudal arrangement depending on regional tradition and the nature of feudal lordship (secular or ecclesiastical/monastic).

The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers. There were no feudal relationships between farmers and the lower vassals.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages another structure developed in Germany, the so-called ''[[Heerschild]]ordnung'', a medieval feudal hierarchy:\n\n* King (''K\u00f6nig'')\n* Ecclesiastical princes (''Geistliche F\u00fcrsten'')\n* Secular, or lay, princes (''Weltliche F\u00fcrsten'')\n* Counts and barons (''Grafen und Freiherren'')\n* [[Ministeriales]] (''Ministerialen'' or ''Dienstmannen'')\n* Vassals of the ministeriales (''M\u00e4nner der Ministerialen'')\n* Free knights (''Ritterb\u00fcrtige Mannen'') (who could only receive a fief, not grant one)\n\nInitially, only those of knightly birth were entitled to be enfeoffed, i.e. free knights who could bear arms and were in full possession of their title.

In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.\n\nIn return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.\n\nIn Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (''[[Latifundia]]'') as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.\n \nClients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.\n\n=== Germanic clan system ===\nDuring the latter years of the period of [[Sippe|clan society]] with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the [[king]]. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only ''in persona''. On the death of king or vassal, the land was [[de facto]] returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person [[enfeoffed]] with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the [[fief]] and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (''Lehnseid''), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of [[enfeoffment]].\n\nThe vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.\n\nThe Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or ''Lehnsrecht'', a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.\n\nThe enforcement of ''Lehnsrecht'' is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods. [[Money]] could not bind a [[vassal]] to a king, only land. Unlike money, this was plentiful.\n\nEven kings (see [[Richard the Lionheart]] - compulsory allegiance) and at least in the early Middle Ages, the [[clergy]] (see [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]]-[[Salian dynasty|Salian]] [[imperial church]] system) could be vassals of a king or another king.\n\n=== Emergence of feudal relationships ===\n[[File:Lehnseid.png|thumb|Acceptain of the oath of fealty (''Lehnseid'') in 1512]]\nUnder the feudal system, various legal institutions came together during the [[Carolingian period]] that had previously existed independently. These institutions were:\n* The ''[[antrustiones]]'' - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual [[weregild]] had to be paid to them.\n* The ''vassi'' - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to [[commend]] themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]] ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called ''handgang'' ceremony, i.e. the future ''vassus'' put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.\n* The ''beneficium'' (original meaning of \"benefit\") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.\n\nIt was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.\nThe ''handgang'', which together with the oath of loyalty (''Treueid''), became referred to as ''homagium'' (Latin), ''homage'' (French), or ''mannschaft'' (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the ''handgang'' dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.\n\n[[Commendation ceremony|Commendation]]s were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the [[manorial]] system (''Grundherrschaft''), at the high levels on feudalism (''Lehnswesen'').\n\nThe award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the [[monetary system]] necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.\n\n=== Subsequent development ===\nAs the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. <!-- (see [[Personenverbandsstaat]]) -->\n\nIt was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as ''Afterlehen'' to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by [[Conrad II (HRR)|Conrad II]] in the ''[[constitutio de feudis]]''. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.\n\nWithin each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (''Vassallen''), liegemen (''Dienstmannen'') - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the [[university]] system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened [[territorial lordship]] (''Landesherrschaft''), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.\n\nIn England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (''Lehnsverband'') was a long process. Legally, it was abolished ''inter alia'' by the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] acts, in the [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation]] and the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as G\u00f6rtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at [[Bad Salzschlirf|Salzschlirf]] and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an [[Allied Control Council]] edict.\n\n== Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire ==\nIn general, the vassal (''Lehnsmann'') was granted land or [[Freihaus|free houses]] (''Freih\u00e4user'') in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called ''servi non cassati'' were given a fief as soon as one became available.\n\nOfficial positions (''\u00c4mter'') and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal [[regalia]]) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the [[House of Thurn and Taxis]] received its '''''Postlehen''''' or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (''[[Stift]]e'' or ''feudal ecclesiastica'') and enfeoffments of [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s associated with an [[altar]] (''feudum altaragli''). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.\n\n=== Feoffment ===\nFeoffment (''constitutio feudi, infeudatio'') involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a [[commendation ceremony]]. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (''Handgang''):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an [[oath of allegiance]], which was usually sworn on a religious [[relic]]. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.\n\nIn the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (''homagium'' or ''Mannschaft''), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as [[livery of seizin]] and could be a staff or a banner (called a ''Fahnenlehn''). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called ''Zepterlehen''). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.\n\nThe fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (''Lehnsauftragung'') and then received it back as a fief ([[Oblation (legal)|''oblatio feudi'']]). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.\n\n=== Legal relationship between lords and vassals ===\nFrom the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as ''auxilium et consilium'' (help and advice). ''Auxilium'' usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. ''Consilium'' meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or ''[[Hoftag]]e''. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.\n\nThe vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the [[accolade]] of his eldest son, for the [[dowry]] of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the [[Holy Land]].\n\nThe feudal lord could also demand recompense (''Lehnserneuerung'' or ''renovatio investiturae'') from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as ''Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall'') - as well as changes of vassal (known as ''Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall'' or ''Mannfall, Nebenfall''). The latter had to submit a written application (''Lehnsmutung'') within a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]] (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (''Lehnsindult'').\n\nDepending on [[local law]], the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the ''Schreibschilling'' or ''Lehnstaxe''), to pay a special tax (the ''Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware'' or ''Handlohn''). Finally, in the event of a [[felony]] by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called ''Privationsklage'' action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.\n\nThe duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (''Lehnsprotektion'') and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the \"right of use\" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  ''Lehnsobjekt''). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.\n\n=== Dissolution of a feudal relationship ===\nOriginally, a lord-vassal tie (''Lehnsbindung'') was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (''Lehnsmann'') considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.\n\n[[File:Seegr\u00e4ben IMG 3630.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Lehenhof'' built in 1710 in [[Seegr\u00e4ben]], Switzerland]]\n\n== Summary ==\nIn summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.\n\nPersonal element:\nThe lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty. The visible expression of this commitment was the act of the vassal placing his hands in those of his lord (''handgang'' - comparable with today's handshake, except that the ''handgang'' symbolized a hierarchical relation).\n\nMaterial element:\nBased on the pledge of loyalty between them, the lord made land available to the vassal. The vassal was obliged, in return, to render various services and taxes.\n\n== Family, house and place names ==\nAn echo of the old feudal system in Europe is found in family names such as [[Lehner]], Lechner, Lehmann, Lehle, Horrigan and Lenherr as well as in numerous house and even place names, that even today have the term ''Lehen'' in the names (see a list at [[Lehen (disambiguation)]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Feudalism]]\n* [[Feudal law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Marc Bloch]]: ''Die Feudalgesellschaft'', durchgesehene Neuausgabe, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart, 1999, {{ISBN|3-608-91234-7}}.\n* J\u00fcrgen Dendorfer / Roman Deutinger (ed.): ''Das Lehnswesen im Hochmittelalter.
