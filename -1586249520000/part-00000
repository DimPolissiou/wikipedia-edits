During the [[cholera]] epidemics of 1833 and 1854 in Pittsburgh, Delany treated patients, even though many doctors and residents fled the city out of fear of contamination. In this period, people did not know how the disease was transmitted.\n\nIn 1850, Delany was one of the first three black men admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]], but all were dismissed after a few weeks because of widespread protests by white students. Delany had traveled in the South in 1839 to observe slavery firsthand. Beginning in 1847, he worked alongside [[Frederick Douglass]] in Rochester, New York to publish the ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|North Star]]''.\n\nDelany dreamed of establishing a settlement in West Africa. He visited [[Liberia]], a United States colony founded by the [[American Colonization Society]], and lived in Canada for several years, but when the [[American Civil War]] began, he returned to the United States. Beginning in 1863, he recruited blacks for the [[United States Colored Troops]]. Commissioned as a major in February 1865, Delany became the first African-American field grade officer in the [[United States Army]].\n\nAfter the Civil War, Delany went to the South, settling in South Carolina. There he worked for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] and became politically active, including in the [[Colored Conventions Movement]]. Delany ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He was appointed as a trial judge, but he was removed following a scandal. Delany later switched his party affiliation. He worked for the campaign of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Wade Hampton III]], who won the 1876 election for governor in a season marked by violent suppression of black Republican voters by [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and fraud in balloting.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDelany was born free in [[Charles Town, Virginia]] (present-day [[Charles Town, West Virginia]], not [[Charleston, West Virginia]]) to Pati and Samuel Delany. Although his father was enslaved, his mother was a free woman. Under Virginia's slave laws, children were considered born into the social status of their mothers (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). All of Delany's grandparents had been born in Africa. His paternal grandparents were of [[Gola people|Gola]] ethnicity (from modern-day Liberia), taken captive during warfare and brought as slaves to the Virginia colony. Family oral history said that the grandfather was a [[chieftain]], who had escaped to Canada for a period, and died resisting slavery abuses.<ref name=\"Rollins\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=M4WP3QM7p30C&q=Martin+Delany&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6#v=onepage&q=Martin%20Delany%27s%20mother&f=false  Frank A.

Delany''], 1883, reprint 1969, Arno Press, pp. 14\u201317; accessed February 21, 2011.</ref>\n\nHis mother Pati's parents were born in the [[Niger River|Niger Valley]], West Africa, and were of [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] ethnicity. Her father was said to have been a [[prince]]<ref>Glasco (2004), p. 56</ref> named Shango, captured with his betrothed Graci and brought to America as slaves. After some time, their master gave them their freedom in Virginia, perhaps based on their noble birth. Shango returned to Africa. Graci stayed in the colony with their only daughter Pati.<ref name=\"Rollins\"/> When Delany was just a few years old, attempts were made to enslave him and a sibling. Their mother Pati carried her two youngest children 20 miles to the courthouse in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] to argue successfully for her family's freedom, based on her own free birth.<ref name=\"Rollins\"/>\n\nAs he was growing up, Delany and his siblings learned to read and write using ''The New York Primer and Spelling Book'', given to them by a peddler. Virginia prohibited education of black people. When the book was discovered in September 1822, Pati moved with her children to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] in the free state of [[Pennsylvania]] to ensure their continued freedom. They had to leave their father Samuel, but a year later he was allowed to buy his freedom and he rejoined his family in Chambersburg.<ref name=\"DABV6\">Gates Jr, Henry Louis, Emmanuel Akyeampong, and Steven J. Niven. ''Dictionary of African Biography''. Vol. 6. Oxford University Press, USA, 2012. pp. 177-179</ref>\n\nIn Chambersburg, young Martin continued learning. Occasionally he left school to work when his family could not afford for him to study. In Pennsylvania, blacks were only educated through the elementary grades, so Delany educated himself by reading. In 1831, at the age of 19, he journeyed west to the growing city of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], where he became a barber and laborer, and attended the Cellar School of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He apprenticed with a white physician.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Delany made his mark as a doctor, writer, black nationalist, officer\n|first=Diana\n|last=Blowers\n|newspaper=[[Dayton Daily News]] ([[Dayton, Ohio]])\n|date=February 22, 1995\n|page=25\n|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34782234/article_on_martin_robison_delaney/\n|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nDelany and three other young black men were later accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]], but they were forced to leave after white students protested.

The parents stressed education, and some of their children graduated from college.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Pittsburgh==\nDelany became involved with Trinity [[A.M.E. Church]] on Wylie Avenue, which had classes for adults. The church was part of the first independent black denomination in the United States, which was founded earlier in the 19th century in Philadelphia. Shortly after, he began attending [[Washington & Jefferson College|Jefferson College]], where he was taught [[classics]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] by Molliston M. Clark. During the national [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832, Delany became apprenticed to Dr. Andrew N. McDowell, where he learned contemporary techniques of [[fire cupping]] and [[Hirudotherapy|leeching]], then considered the primary techniques to treat most diseases. He continued to study medicine under the mentorship of Dr. McDowell and other abolitionist doctors, such as Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne and Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam of Pittsburgh.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p487</ref>\n\nDelany became more active in political matters. In 1835, he attended his first National Negro Convention, held annually in Philadelphia since 1831.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newpittsburghcourieronline.com/index.php/featured-news/national/13530-this-week-in-black-history-5-29-13?showall=&start=3|title=This Week In Black History 5-29-13|work=New Pittsburgh Courier|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130708061731/http://www.newpittsburghcourieronline.com/index.php/featured-news/national/13530-this-week-in-black-history-5-29-13?showall=&start=3|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/national-negro-convention-movement-1831-1864|title=National Negro Convention Movement (1831-1864) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|work=blackpast.org|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> He was inspired to conceive a plan to set up a 'Black Israel' on the east coast of Africa.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Delany began writing on public issues. In 1843, he began publishing ''The Mystery'', a black-controlled newspaper.  His articles and other writings were often reprinted in other venues, such as in abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p29</ref> A eulogy which Delany delivered for Rev. Fayette Davis in 1847 was widely redistributed. His activities brought controversy in 1846, when he was sued for libel by \"Fiddler\" Johnson, a black man he accused in ''The Mystery'' of being a [[slave catcher]]. Delany was convicted and fined $650 \u2014 a huge amount at the time. His white supporters in the newspaper business paid the fine for him.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p27</ref>\n\nWhile [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] were in Pittsburgh in 1847 on an anti-slavery tour, they met with Delany. In the same year, after a falling-out of sorts occurred between Douglass and ''The Liberator'' editor Garrison over the use of violence in the abolition cause and the concept of a strictly African American-run newspaper, Delany with Douglass conceived of the newspaper developed as the ''[[North Star]]'': to give voice to the stories of African Americans from their own accounts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-North-Star-American-newspaper |title=The North Star |date=October 3, 2013 |first=Melissa |last=Petruzzello |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-R-Delany |title=Martin Delany |date=January 12, 2000 |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> They started publication later that year in [[Rochester, New York]], where Douglass was based. Douglass handled the editing, printing, and publishing, while Delany traveled to lecture, report, and obtain subscriptions.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p69-70</ref>\n\nIn July 1848, Delany reported in the ''North Star'' that U.S. District Court Justice [[John McLean]] had instructed the jury in the ''Crosswait'' trial to consider it a punishable offense for a citizen to thwart those trying to \"repossess\" an alleged runaway slave. His coverage influenced the abolitionist [[Salmon P. Chase]] to lead a successful drive to remove McLean as a candidate of the [[Free Soil Party]] for the [[President of the United States|Presidency]] later that summer.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p109-110</ref>\n\n==Medicine and nationalism==\nWhile living in Pittsburgh, Delany studied medicine under doctors. He founded his own practice in cupping and leeching. In 1849, he began to study more seriously to prepare to apply to [[medical school]]. In 1850 he was accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]], after presenting letters of support from seventeen physicians, although other schools had rejected his applications. Delany was one of the first three black men to be admitted there. However, the month after his arrival, a group of white students wrote to the faculty, complaining that \"the admission of blacks to the medical lectures highly detrimental to the interests, and welfare of the Institution of which we are members\". They cited that they had \"no objection to the education and elevation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us.\"{{sfn|Sterling|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\nWithin three weeks, Delany and his two fellow black students, [[Daniel Laing, Jr.]] and [[Isaac H. Snowden]], were dismissed, despite many students and staff at the medical school supporting their being students.{{sfn|Sterling|1996|p=133}} Furious, Delany returned to Pittsburgh. He became convinced that the white ruling class would not allow deserving persons of color to become leaders in society, and his opinions became more extreme. His book, ''The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States, Politically Considered'' (1852), argued that blacks had no future in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Martin R.

More moderate abolitionists were alienated by his position. Some resented his criticizing men who failed to hire colored men in their own businesses. Delany also strongly criticized racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] among [[Freemasons]], a fraternal organization.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDelany worked for a brief period as principal of a [[colored]] school before going into practice as a physician. During a severe cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, since no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control an epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for many of the ill.\n\nDelany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African-American education.<ref>Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980).</ref> He is generally not included among African-American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adeleke|first1=Tunde|title=Martin R.

The 1854 convention approved a resolution stating, \"[A]s men and equals, we demand every political right, privilege and position to which the whites are eligible in the United States, and we will either attain to these, or accept nothing.\"<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p243</ref> A significant number of women attendees also voted for the resolution, considered the foundation of [[black nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 1856, Delany moved his family to [[Chatham, Ontario]], Canada, where they remained for nearly three years. In Chatham, he assisted in [[Underground Railroad]] activities, helping resettle American refugee slaves who had reached freedom in Canada.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn response to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1855), in 1859 and 1862, Delany published parts of ''[[Blake; or, The Huts of America]]'' in serialized form. His novel portrayed an insurrectionist's travels through slave communities. He believed that Stowe had portrayed slaves as too passive, although he praised her highlighting the cruelty of Southern slave owners. Modern scholars have praised Delany's novel as an accurate expression of black culture. The first half of Part One was serialized in ''The Anglo-African Magazine'', January to July 1859. The rest of Part One was included in serial form in the ''Weekly Anglo African Magazine'' from 1861 to 1862.<ref>[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/africam/blakehp.html \"Stand still and see the salvation\"], ''Uncle Tom's Cabin & American Culture'', University of Virginia, on line.

The colony had been founded by the [[American Colonization Society]] to relocate free blacks outside of the United States. He traveled for nine months and signed an agreement with eight indigenous chiefs in the [[Abeokuta]] region that would permit settlers to live on \"unused land\" in return for applying their skills for the community's good.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/> It is a question whether Delany and the chiefs shared the same concepts of land use.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The treaty was later dissolved due to warfare in the region, opposition by white missionaries, and the advent of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn April 1860, Delany left Liberia for England, where he was honored by the International Statistical Congress. One American delegate, however, walked out in protest.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/> As 1860 ended, Delany returned to the United States. The next year, he began planning settlement of Abeokuta, and gathered a group of potential settlers and funding. However, when Delany decided to remain in the United States to work for emancipation of slaves, the pioneer plans fell apart.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Union Army service==\n[[File:Major Martin Delany.jpg|thumb|220px|Martin R. Delany was the only black officer who received the rank of major during the Civil War.]]\nIn 1863, after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had called for a military draft, the 51-year-old Delany abandoned his dream of starting a new settlement on Africa's West Coast. Instead, he began recruiting black men for the [[Union Army]]. His efforts in [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], and later [[Ohio]] raised thousands of enlistees, many of whom joined the newly formed [[United States Colored Troops]]. His son [[Toussaint Louverture]] Delany (named after the major leader of the Haitian Revolution) served with the 54th Regiment.<ref>Douglas R. Egerton, ''The Wars of Reconstruction'' (Bloomsbury Press 2014), pp. 24-26</ref> The senior Delany wrote to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], requesting that he make efforts \"to command all of the effective black men as Agents of the United States\", but the request was ignored. During the recruitment, 179,000 black men enlisted in the U.S. Colored Troops, almost 10 percent of all who served in the Union army.<ref>{{cite book|last1=white|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom On My Mind|date=2013|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=334|edition=volume 1}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1865, Delany was granted an audience with Lincoln.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom On My Mind|date=2013|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=335|edition=Volume 1}}</ref> He proposed a corps of black men led by black officers, who he believed could serve to win over Southern blacks to the Union side. Although the government had already rejected a similar appeal by [[Frederick Douglass]], Lincoln was impressed by Delany and described him as \"a most extraordinary and intelligent man\".<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p388</ref> Delany was commissioned as a major in February 1865, becoming the first black line field officer in the U.S. Army and achieving the highest rank an African American would reach during the Civil War.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/><ref>Egerton p. 51</ref>\n\nDelany especially wanted to lead colored troops into [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the former secessionist hotbed. When Union forces captured the city, Major Delany was invited to the War Department ceremony in which Major General [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] would unfurl the very flag over [[Fort Sumter]] that he had been forced to lower four years earlier. Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Wilson]] and abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Henry Ward Beecher]] also participated in the ceremony. Major Delany had recruited black Charlestonians to restore the capacity of the 103rd and 104th regiments and start the 105th regiment of U.S. Colored Troops. He arrived at the ceremony with Robert Vesey, son of [[Denmark Vesey]], who had been executed for starting a slave rebellion. The man came in the ''Planter'', a ship piloted by the former slave [[Robert Smalls]] (who had taken it over during the war and driven the ship to Union lines, running the Confederate blockade outside Charleston Harbor).\n\nThe following day, the city learned that President Lincoln had been assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Delany continued with the planned political rally for Charleston's freedmen, with Garrison and Senator Warner as speakers.<ref>Egerton, pp. 2-6</ref> He soon published an open letter to African Americans asking them to contribute to a memorial for \"the Father of American Liberty\".<ref>Egerton p. 91</ref> Two weeks later, Delany was scheduled to speak at another rally, before the visiting [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]]. A journalist was surprised when Delany addressed the issue of ill-feelings between black freedmen and mulattos (or \"browns\", [[free people of color]] and mixed race) in Charleston. He said that two mulattos had informed authorities about Denmark Vesey's plans for a rebellion in 1822 conspiracy, rather than trying to promote racial healing and empowerment between the groups.<ref>Egerton pp. 7, 14-15</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Delany initially remained with the Army and served under General [[Rufus Saxton]] in the 52nd U.S. Colored Troops. He was later transferred to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], serving on [[Hilton Head, South Carolina|Hilton Head]]. He shocked white officers by taking a strong position in supporting redistribution of land to freedmen. Later in 1865, Delany was mustered out of the Freedmen's Bureau and shortly afterward resigned from the Army.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing the war, Delany continued to be politically active. He established a land and brokerage business in 1871 and worked to help black cotton farmers improve their business and negotiating skills to get a better price for their product.<ref>Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877'' p. 546</ref> He supported the [[Freedman's Bank]] (as did Douglass), and also traveled and spoke in support of the [[Colored Conventions Movement]].<ref>Egerton pp. 130, 192</ref> Delany also argued against carpetbaggers and black candidates for office when he saw fit. For instance, he opposed the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential candidacy]] of [[Jonathan Jasper Wright]] and [[John Mercer Langston]] on the grounds of inexperience,<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p409-410</ref> and he opposed the candidacy of another black man as Charleston's mayor.\n\nDelany unsuccessfully sought various positions, such as appointment as Consul General to [[Liberia]].<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p437</ref> In 1874, Delany ran as an [[Independent Republican Party of South Carolina|Independent Republican]] for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina (with [[John T. Green]] as the gubernatorial candidate). Despite the corruption scandals that enveloped former Republican governor [[Franklin Moses, Jr.]] (who chose not to run for re-election), their ticket lost to Republican Attorney General [[Daniel H. Chamberlain]] and his running mate [[Richard Howell Gleaves]].<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003), p442<br>- Foner p. 543</ref>\n\nDelany was appointed as a trial justice (judge) in Charleston.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p490</ref> In 1875, charges of \"defrauding a church\" were brought against him. After conviction, he was forced to resign, and served time in jail.

However, the election was marred by white intimidation and violence against black Republicans, in an effort to suppress the black vote. Armed men from \"rifle clubs\" and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] operated openly. The latter was a [[paramilitary]] group of mostly white men who worked to suppress black voting as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> By 1876, South Carolina rifle clubs had about 20,000 white men as members.<ref name=\"cisco\">Walter Brian Cisco, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uqKmExW5vE8C&pg=PA272&dq=Wade+Hampton+accusations&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UkV8UpWAJcbmyQG_n4CAAw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=REd%20Shirts&f=false ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior, Conservative Statesman''], Potomac Books, 2004, p. 260</ref> More than 150 blacks were killed in election-related violence.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p. 174</ref>\n\nIn early 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South after reaching a compromise over the national election. This marked the end to Reconstruction, and Governor Chamberlain left the state. The Democrats, calling themselves Redeemers, had taken control of South Carolina's legislature. Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts continued to suppress black voting in the Carolinas, especially in the upland counties.\n\nIn reaction to whites regaining power and the suppression of black voting, Charleston-based blacks started planning again for emigration to Africa. In 1877, they formed the Liberia Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company, with Delany as chairman of the finance committee. A year later, the company purchased a ship, the ''Azor'', for the voyage led by [[Harrison N. Bouey]]. He served as president of the board to organize the voyage.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\n==Last years and death==\nIn 1880, Delany withdrew from the project to serve his family. Two of his children were students at [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] in Ohio and required money for tuition fees. His wife had been working as a seamstress to make ends meet.

During the [[cholera]] epidemics of 1833 and 1854 in Pittsburgh, Delany treated patients, even though many doctors and residents fled the city out of fear of contamination. In this period, people did not know how the disease was transmitted.\n\nIn 1850, Delany was one of the first three black men admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]], but all were dismissed after a few weeks because of widespread protests by white students. Delany had traveled in the South in 1839 to observe slavery firsthand. Beginning in 1847, he worked alongside [[Frederick Douglass]] in Rochester, New York to publish the ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|North Star]]''.\n\nDelany dreamed of establishing a settlement in West Africa. He visited [[Liberia]], a United States colony founded by the [[American Colonization Society]], and lived in Canada for several years, but when the [[American Civil War]] began, he returned to the United States. Beginning in 1863, he recruited blacks for the [[United States Colored Troops]]. Commissioned as a major in February 1865, Delany became the first African-American field grade officer in the [[United States Army]].\n\nAfter the Civil War, Delany went to the South, settling in South Carolina. There he worked for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] and became politically active, including in the [[Colored Conventions Movement]]. Delany ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He was appointed as a trial judge, but he was removed following a scandal. Delany later switched his party affiliation. He worked for the campaign of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Wade Hampton III]], who won the 1876 election for governor in a season marked by violent suppression of black Republican voters by [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and fraud in balloting.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDelany was born free in [[Charles Town, Virginia]] (present-day [[Charles Town, West Virginia]], not [[Charleston, West Virginia]]) to Pati and Samuel Delany. Although his father was enslaved, his mother was a free woman. Under Virginia's slave laws, children were considered born into the social status of their mothers (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). All of Delany's grandparents had been born in Africa. His paternal grandparents were of [[Gola people|Gola]] ethnicity (from modern-day Liberia), taken captive during warfare and brought as slaves to the Virginia colony. Family oral history said that the grandfather was a [[chieftain]], who had escaped to Canada for a period, and died resisting slavery abuses.<ref name=\"Rollins\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=M4WP3QM7p30C&q=Martin+Delany&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6#v=onepage&q=Martin%20Delany%27s%20mother&f=false  Frank A.

Delany''], 1883, reprint 1969, Arno Press, pp. 14\u201317; accessed February 21, 2011.</ref>\n\nHis mother Pati's parents were born in the [[Niger River|Niger Valley]], West Africa, and were of [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] ethnicity. Her father was said to have been a [[prince]]<ref>Glasco (2004), p. 56</ref> named Shango, captured with his betrothed Graci and brought to America as slaves. After some time, their master gave them their freedom in Virginia, perhaps based on their noble birth. Shango returned to Africa. Graci stayed in the colony with their only daughter Pati.<ref name=\"Rollins\"/> When Delany was just a few years old, attempts were made to enslave him and a sibling. Their mother Pati carried her two youngest children 20 miles to the courthouse in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] to argue successfully for her family's freedom, based on her own free birth.<ref name=\"Rollins\"/>\n\nAs he was growing up, Delany and his siblings learned to read and write using ''The New York Primer and Spelling Book'', given to them by a peddler. Virginia prohibited education of black people. When the book was discovered in September 1822, Pati moved with her children to [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] in the free state of [[Pennsylvania]] to ensure their continued freedom. They had to leave their father Samuel, but a year later he was allowed to buy his freedom and he rejoined his family in Chambersburg.<ref name=\"DABV6\">Gates Jr, Henry Louis, Emmanuel Akyeampong, and Steven J. Niven. ''Dictionary of African Biography''. Vol. 6. Oxford University Press, USA, 2012. pp. 177-179</ref>\n\nIn Chambersburg, young Martin continued learning. Occasionally he left school to work when his family could not afford for him to study. In Pennsylvania, blacks were only educated through the elementary grades, so Delany educated himself by reading. In 1831, at the age of 19, he journeyed west to the growing city of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], where he became a barber and laborer, and attended the Cellar School of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He apprenticed with a white physician.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Delany made his mark as a doctor, writer, black nationalist, officer\n|first=Diana\n|last=Blowers\n|newspaper=[[Dayton Daily News]] ([[Dayton, Ohio]])\n|date=February 22, 1995\n|page=25\n|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34782234/article_on_martin_robison_delaney/\n|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nDelany and three other young black men were later accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]], but they were forced to leave after white students protested.

Church]] on Wylie Avenue, which had classes for adults. The church was part of the first independent black denomination in the United States, which was founded earlier in the 19th century in Philadelphia. Shortly after, he began attending [[Washington & Jefferson College|Jefferson College]], where he was taught [[classics]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] by Molliston M. Clark. During the national [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832, Delany became apprenticed to Dr. Andrew N. McDowell, where he learned contemporary techniques of [[fire cupping]] and [[Hirudotherapy|leeching]], then considered the primary techniques to treat most diseases. He continued to study medicine under the mentorship of Dr. McDowell and other abolitionist doctors, such as Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne and Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam of Pittsburgh.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p487</ref>\n\nDelany became more active in political matters. In 1835, he attended his first National Negro Convention, held annually in Philadelphia since 1831.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newpittsburghcourieronline.com/index.php/featured-news/national/13530-this-week-in-black-history-5-29-13?showall=&start=3|title=This Week In Black History 5-29-13|work=New Pittsburgh Courier|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130708061731/http://www.newpittsburghcourieronline.com/index.php/featured-news/national/13530-this-week-in-black-history-5-29-13?showall=&start=3|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/national-negro-convention-movement-1831-1864|title=National Negro Convention Movement (1831-1864) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|work=blackpast.org|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> He was inspired to conceive a plan to set up a 'Black Israel' on the east coast of Africa.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Delany began writing on public issues. In 1843, he began publishing ''The Mystery'', a black-controlled newspaper.  His articles and other writings were often reprinted in other venues, such as in abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p29</ref> A eulogy which Delany delivered for Rev. Fayette Davis in 1847 was widely redistributed. His activities brought controversy in 1846, when he was sued for libel by \"Fiddler\" Johnson, a black man he accused in ''The Mystery'' of being a [[slave catcher]]. Delany was convicted and fined $650 \u2014 a huge amount at the time. His white supporters in the newspaper business paid the fine for him.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p27</ref>\n\nWhile [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] were in Pittsburgh in 1847 on an anti-slavery tour, they met with Delany. In the same year, after a falling-out of sorts occurred between Douglass and ''The Liberator'' editor Garrison over the use of violence in the abolition cause and the concept of a strictly African American-run newspaper, Delany with Douglass conceived of the newspaper developed as the ''[[North Star]]'': to give voice to the stories of African Americans from their own accounts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-North-Star-American-newspaper |title=The North Star |date=October 3, 2013 |first=Melissa |last=Petruzzello |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-R-Delany |title=Martin Delany |date=January 12, 2000 |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> They started publication later that year in [[Rochester, New York]], where Douglass was based.

His coverage influenced the abolitionist [[Salmon P. Chase]] to lead a successful drive to remove McLean as a candidate of the [[Free Soil Party]] for the [[President of the United States|Presidency]] later that summer.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p109-110</ref>\n\n==Medicine and nationalism==\nWhile living in Pittsburgh, Delany studied medicine under doctors. He founded his own practice in cupping and leeching. In 1849, he began to study more seriously to prepare to apply to [[medical school]]. In 1850 he was accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]], after presenting letters of support from seventeen physicians, although other schools had rejected his applications. Delany was one of the first three black men to be admitted there. However, the month after his arrival, a group of white students wrote to the faculty, complaining that \"the admission of blacks to the medical lectures highly detrimental to the interests, and welfare of the Institution of which we are members\". They cited that they had \"no objection to the education and elevation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us.\"{{sfn|Sterling|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\nWithin three weeks, Delany and his two fellow black students, [[Daniel Laing, Jr.]] and [[Isaac H. Snowden]], were dismissed, despite many students and staff at the medical school supporting their being students.{{sfn|Sterling|1996|p=133}} Furious, Delany returned to Pittsburgh. He became convinced that the white ruling class would not allow deserving persons of color to become leaders in society, and his opinions became more extreme. His book, ''The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States, Politically Considered'' (1852), argued that blacks had no future in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Martin R.

More moderate abolitionists were alienated by his position. Some resented his criticizing men who failed to hire colored men in their own businesses. Delany also strongly criticized racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] among [[Freemasons]], a fraternal organization.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDelany worked for a brief period as principal of a [[colored]] school before going into practice as a physician. During a severe cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, since no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control an epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for many of the ill.\n\nDelany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African-American education.<ref>Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980).</ref> He is generally not included among African-American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adeleke|first1=Tunde|title=Martin R.

The 1854 convention approved a resolution stating, \"[A]s men and equals, we demand every political right, privilege and position to which the whites are eligible in the United States, and we will either attain to these, or accept nothing.\"<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p243</ref> A significant number of women attendees also voted for the resolution, considered the foundation of [[black nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 1856, Delany moved his family to [[Chatham, Ontario]], Canada, where they remained for nearly three years. In Chatham, he assisted in [[Underground Railroad]] activities, helping resettle American refugee slaves who had reached freedom in Canada.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn response to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1855), in 1859 and 1862, Delany published parts of ''[[Blake; or, The Huts of America]]'' in serialized form. His novel portrayed an insurrectionist's travels through slave communities. He believed that Stowe had portrayed slaves as too passive, although he praised her highlighting the cruelty of Southern slave owners. Modern scholars have praised Delany's novel as an accurate expression of black culture. The first half of Part One was serialized in ''The Anglo-African Magazine'', January to July 1859. The rest of Part One was included in serial form in the ''Weekly Anglo African Magazine'' from 1861 to 1862.<ref>[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/africam/blakehp.html \"Stand still and see the salvation\"], ''Uncle Tom's Cabin & American Culture'', University of Virginia, on line.

The colony had been founded by the [[American Colonization Society]] to relocate free blacks outside of the United States. He traveled for nine months and signed an agreement with eight indigenous chiefs in the [[Abeokuta]] region that would permit settlers to live on \"unused land\" in return for applying their skills for the community's good.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/> It is a question whether Delany and the chiefs shared the same concepts of land use.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The treaty was later dissolved due to warfare in the region, opposition by white missionaries, and the advent of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nIn April 1860, Delany left Liberia for England, where he was honored by the International Statistical Congress. One American delegate, however, walked out in protest.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/> As 1860 ended, Delany returned to the United States. The next year, he began planning settlement of Abeokuta, and gathered a group of potential settlers and funding. However, when Delany decided to remain in the United States to work for emancipation of slaves, the pioneer plans fell apart.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Union Army service==\n[[File:Major Martin Delany.jpg|thumb|220px|Martin R. Delany was the only black officer who received the rank of major during the Civil War.]]\nIn 1863, after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had called for a military draft, the 51-year-old Delany abandoned his dream of starting a new settlement on Africa's West Coast. Instead, he began recruiting black men for the [[Union Army]]. His efforts in [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], and later [[Ohio]] raised thousands of enlistees, many of whom joined the newly formed [[United States Colored Troops]]. His son [[Toussaint Louverture]] Delany (named after the major leader of the Haitian Revolution) served with the 54th Regiment.<ref>Douglas R. Egerton, ''The Wars of Reconstruction'' (Bloomsbury Press 2014), pp. 24-26</ref> The senior Delany wrote to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], requesting that he make efforts \"to command all of the effective black men as Agents of the United States\", but the request was ignored. During the recruitment, 179,000 black men enlisted in the U.S. Colored Troops, almost 10 percent of all who served in the Union army.<ref>{{cite book|last1=white|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom On My Mind|date=2013|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=334|edition=volume 1}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1865, Delany was granted an audience with Lincoln.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom On My Mind|date=2013|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=335|edition=Volume 1}}</ref> He proposed a corps of black men led by black officers, who he believed could serve to win over Southern blacks to the Union side. Although the government had already rejected a similar appeal by [[Frederick Douglass]], Lincoln was impressed by Delany and described him as \"a most extraordinary and intelligent man\".<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p388</ref> Delany was commissioned as a major in February 1865, becoming the first black line field officer in the U.S. Army and achieving the highest rank an African American would reach during the Civil War.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/><ref>Egerton p. 51</ref>\n\nDelany especially wanted to lead colored troops into [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the former secessionist hotbed. When Union forces captured the city, Major Delany was invited to the War Department ceremony in which Major General [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] would unfurl the very flag over [[Fort Sumter]] that he had been forced to lower four years earlier. Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Wilson]] and abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Henry Ward Beecher]] also participated in the ceremony. Major Delany had recruited black Charlestonians to restore the capacity of the 103rd and 104th regiments and start the 105th regiment of U.S. Colored Troops. He arrived at the ceremony with Robert Vesey, son of [[Denmark Vesey]], who had been executed for starting a slave rebellion. The man came in the ''Planter'', a ship piloted by the former slave [[Robert Smalls]] (who had taken it over during the war and driven the ship to Union lines, running the Confederate blockade outside Charleston Harbor).\n\nThe following day, the city learned that President Lincoln had been assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Delany continued with the planned political rally for Charleston's freedmen, with Garrison and Senator Warner as speakers.<ref>Egerton, pp. 2-6</ref> He soon published an open letter to African Americans asking them to contribute to a memorial for \"the Father of American Liberty\".<ref>Egerton p. 91</ref> Two weeks later, Delany was scheduled to speak at another rally, before the visiting [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]]. A journalist was surprised when Delany addressed the issue of ill-feelings between black freedmen and mulattos (or \"browns\", [[free people of color]] and mixed race) in Charleston. He said that two mulattos had informed authorities about Denmark Vesey's plans for a rebellion in 1822 conspiracy, rather than trying to promote racial healing and empowerment between the groups.<ref>Egerton pp. 7, 14-15</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Delany initially remained with the Army and served under General [[Rufus Saxton]] in the 52nd U.S. Colored Troops. He was later transferred to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], serving on [[Hilton Head, South Carolina|Hilton Head]]. He shocked white officers by taking a strong position in supporting redistribution of land to freedmen. Later in 1865, Delany was mustered out of the Freedmen's Bureau and shortly afterward resigned from the Army.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing the war, Delany continued to be politically active. He established a land and brokerage business in 1871 and worked to help black cotton farmers improve their business and negotiating skills to get a better price for their product.<ref>Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877'' p. 546</ref> He supported the [[Freedman's Bank]] (as did Douglass), and also traveled and spoke in support of the [[Colored Conventions Movement]].<ref>Egerton pp. 130, 192</ref> Delany also argued against carpetbaggers and black candidates for office when he saw fit. For instance, he opposed the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential candidacy]] of [[Jonathan Jasper Wright]] and [[John Mercer Langston]] on the grounds of inexperience,<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p409-410</ref> and he opposed the candidacy of another black man as Charleston's mayor.\n\nDelany unsuccessfully sought various positions, such as appointment as Consul General to [[Liberia]].<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p437</ref> In 1874, Delany ran as an [[Independent Republican Party of South Carolina|Independent Republican]] for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina (with [[John T. Green]] as the gubernatorial candidate). Despite the corruption scandals that enveloped former Republican governor [[Franklin Moses, Jr.]] (who chose not to run for re-election), their ticket lost to Republican Attorney General [[Daniel H. Chamberlain]] and his running mate [[Richard Howell Gleaves]].<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003), p442<br>- Foner p. 543</ref>\n\nDelany was appointed as a trial justice (judge) in Charleston.<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p490</ref> In 1875, charges of \"defrauding a church\" were brought against him. After conviction, he was forced to resign, and served time in jail. Although pardoned by Republican [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Governor Chamberlain]], with the intervention of [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]],<ref>Levine (editor) and Delany (2003) p452</ref> Delany was not allowed to return to his former position.\n\nDelany supported Democratic candidate [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|1876 gubernatorial election]], the only prominent black to do so.<ref>Foner p. 572</ref> Partly as a result of black swing votes encouraged by Delany, Hampton won the election by fewer than 1,100 votes. However, the election was marred by white intimidation and violence against black Republicans, in an effort to suppress the black vote. Armed men from \"rifle clubs\" and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] operated openly. The latter was a [[paramilitary]] group of mostly white men who worked to suppress black voting as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> By 1876, South Carolina rifle clubs had about 20,000 white men as members.<ref name=\"cisco\">Walter Brian Cisco, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uqKmExW5vE8C&pg=PA272&dq=Wade+Hampton+accusations&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UkV8UpWAJcbmyQG_n4CAAw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=REd%20Shirts&f=false ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior, Conservative Statesman''], Potomac Books, 2004, p. 260</ref> More than 150 blacks were killed in election-related violence.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p. 174</ref>\n\nIn early 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South after reaching a compromise over the national election. This marked the end to Reconstruction, and Governor Chamberlain left the state. The Democrats, calling themselves Redeemers, had taken control of South Carolina's legislature. Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts continued to suppress black voting in the Carolinas, especially in the upland counties.\n\nIn reaction to whites regaining power and the suppression of black voting, Charleston-based blacks started planning again for emigration to Africa. In 1877, they formed the Liberia Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company, with Delany as chairman of the finance committee. A year later, the company purchased a ship, the ''Azor'', for the voyage led by [[Harrison N. Bouey]]. He served as president of the board to organize the voyage.<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\n==Last years and death==\nIn 1880, Delany withdrew from the project to serve his family. Two of his children were students at [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] in Ohio and required money for tuition fees. His wife had been working as a seamstress to make ends meet. Delany began practicing medicine again in Charleston. On January 24, 1885, he died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]].<ref name=\"DABV6\"/>\n\nDelany is interred in a family plot at Massies Creek Cemetery in [[Cedarville, Ohio]], next to his wife Catherine, who died July 11, 1894.<ref>[http://www.lwfaam.net/event/memorial.htm MARTIN ROBISON DELANY MONUMENT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106061821/http://www.lwfaam.net/event/memorial.htm |date=2016-01-06}}, lwfaam.net.

The route runs from [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]] in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]] northwest to [[Easton, Maryland|Easton]] in [[Talbot County, Maryland|Talbot County]], intersecting [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] (US 50) at both ends. MD 331 is a two-lane undivided road most of its length that passes mostly through agricultural areas. The road also passes through the communities of [[Hurlock, Maryland|Hurlock]] and [[Preston, Maryland|Preston]] along the way. It encounters several routes during its journey, including [[Maryland Route 14|MD 14]] near [[Rhodesdale, Maryland|Rhodesdale]] and [[Maryland Route 16|MD 16]] in the Preston area, both of which the route forms [[concurrency (road)|concurrencies]] with. In addition, the route also intersects with [[Maryland Route 392|MD 392]] and [[Maryland Route 307|MD 307]] in Hurlock and with [[Maryland Route 318|MD 318]] near Preston.\n\nMost of present-day MD 331 was designated as part of [[U.S. Route 213|US 213]] in 1926 when the [[U.S. Highway System]] was established. By 1940, US 213 was moved to a new alignment that crossed the [[Choptank River]] at [[Cambridge, Maryland|Cambridge]] on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city.\n\n==Route description==\nMD 331 is a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] as a principal arterial within the town of Easton.<ref name=\"MarylandHLR\"/><ref name=\"National Highway System\">{{cite map|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|title=National Highway System: Maryland|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/maryland/md_maryland.pdf|date=October 1, 2012|section=|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dorchester County===\n[[File:MD 16-MD 331 Preston shields.jpg|thumb|left|Shields for MD 16 and MD 331 in Preston]]MD 331 begins at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]] (Ocean Gateway) in [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]], [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]], a short distance west of the [[Nanticoke River]].

In 1910, the only paved sections of the highway were the approaches to Dover Bridge in both Talbot County and Caroline County.<ref name=\"1910 map\"/>  The state road was paved from Hurlock to Shiloh Church in 1912, from Easton to Waddell's Corner in 1913 and 1914, from Waddell's Corner to Hurlock in 1915, and within Hurlock in 1916.<ref name=\"1915 src report\"/><ref name=\"1919 src report\"/>  When the U.S. Highway System was organized in 1926, the state road became part of US 213.<ref name=\"1927 map\"/><ref name=\"1926 US Highway Map\"/>\n\nThe first section of the Vienna&ndash;Rhodesdale highway was {{convert|2|mi|km}} of pavement south from Rhodesdale that was completed by 1923.<ref name=\"1923 map\"/>  The remainder of the highway was under construction by 1924, with another {{convert|2|mi|km}} section of the road completed north from Vienna by 1927.<ref name=\"1927 map\"/><ref name=\"1926 src report\"/>  The gap between Vienna and Rhodesdale was filled in 1928.<ref name=\"1928 map\"/>  When the Nanticoke River Bridge at Vienna was completed in 1931, US 213 was rerouted between Mardela Springs and Rhodesdale to pass through Vienna.<ref name=\"1934 src report\"/><ref name=\"1933 map\"/>  A new Dover Bridge, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932.<ref name=\"1934 src report\"/><ref name=\"NBI Dover Bridge\"/><ref name=\"Dover Bridges\"/>  In 1939, the original MD 331 and US 213 swapped routes; US 213 also assumed MD 344 between Vienna and MD 16 at Mount Holly.<ref name=\"1939 map\"/>\n\nMD 331 has seen little change since 1939.  MD 331 and MD 16 were realigned around Ellwood and Linchester around 1960.<ref name=\"NBI Hunting Creek\"/><ref name=\"1960 map\"/>  MD 331's southern terminus was truncated at its newly constructed interchange with US 50 in Vienna in 1991 shortly after US 50 bypassed Vienna.<ref name=\"1991 map\"/>  MD 331's northern terminus has been rolled back twice in Easton.

{{convert|28.74|mi|km|2|adj=on}} [[state highway]] on the [[Maryland Eastern Shore|Eastern Shore]] of [[Maryland]] in the [[United States]]. The route runs from [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]] in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]] northwest to [[Easton, Maryland|Easton]] in [[Talbot County, Maryland|Talbot County]], intersecting [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] (US 50) at both ends. MD 331 is a two-lane undivided road most of its length that passes mostly through agricultural areas. The road also passes through the communities of [[Hurlock, Maryland|Hurlock]] and [[Preston, Maryland|Preston]] along the way. It encounters several routes during its journey, including [[Maryland Route 14|MD 14]] near [[Rhodesdale, Maryland|Rhodesdale]] and [[Maryland Route 16|MD 16]] in the Preston area, both of which the route forms [[concurrency (road)|concurrencies]] with. In addition, the route also intersects with [[Maryland Route 392|MD 392]] and [[Maryland Route 307|MD 307]] in Hurlock and with [[Maryland Route 318|MD 318]] near Preston.\n\nMost of present-day MD 331 was designated as part of [[U.S. Route 213|US 213]] in 1926 when the [[U.S. Highway System]] was established. By 1940, US 213 was moved to a new alignment that crossed the [[Choptank River]] at [[Cambridge, Maryland|Cambridge]] on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city.\n\n==Route description==\nMD 331 is a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] as a principal arterial within the town of Easton.<ref name=\"MarylandHLR\"/><ref name=\"National Highway System\">{{cite map|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|title=National Highway System: Maryland|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/maryland/md_maryland.pdf|date=October 1, 2012|section=|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dorchester County===\n[[File:MD 16-MD 331 Preston shields.jpg|thumb|left|Shields for MD 16 and MD 331 in Preston]]MD 331 begins at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]] (Ocean Gateway) in [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]], [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]], a short distance west of the [[Nanticoke River]].

The state highway runs {{convert|11.51|mi|km}} from [[Maryland Route 16|MD 16]] near [[Secretary, Maryland|Secretary]] east to [[Maryland Route 313|MD 313]] in [[Eldorado, Maryland|Eldorado]].  MD 14 connects those two towns with the towns of [[East New Market, Maryland|East New Market]] and [[Brookview, Maryland|Brookview]] in northern [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]].  The state highway also shares a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Maryland Route 331|MD 331]] between the communities of [[Rhodesdale, Maryland|Rhodesdale]] and Shiloh Church.  The sections of MD 14 between East New Market and Eldorado were constructed between 1911 and 1914.  The highway through Secretary was constructed in the late 1920s.  The portion of MD 14 east of Shiloh Church was first marked as part of [[U.S. Route 213]] (US 213) in 1927.  In the early 1930s, US 213 was rerouted through [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]]; as a result, MD 14 was extended to its present eastern terminus in Eldorado.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2017-08-21 10 52 48 View west along Maryland State Route 14 (Railroad Avenue) at Jenkins Street in East New Market, Dorchester County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|View west along MD 14 in East New Market]]\nMD 14 begins at an intersection with MD 16 (Mt.

The state highway heads north as Secretary Road in a straight line before curving to the east and crossing the [[Warwick River (Maryland)|Warwick River]], where the highway's name changes to Main Street and the route enters the town of Secretary.  MD 14 intersects Poplar Street, which leads to the [[suicide bridge]] over Cabin Creek, before leaving the town.<ref name=\"Suicide Bridge\"/>  The state highway's name changes to Secretary East New Market Road as the road turns southeast toward the second town.  MD 14 passes through East New Market on Academy Road and Railroad Avenue, with the name change occurring at the center of town at the highway's second intersection with MD 16, known at this point as Main Street.  After intersecting [[Maryland Route 392|MD 392]] (East New Market Bypass) and crossing the Seaford Line of the [[Maryland and Delaware Railroad]], MD 14 leaves the town limits of East New Market.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 14\"/>\n\nMD 14 continues east as East New Market Rhodesdale Road.  The state highway passes [[North Dorchester High School]] before the western intersection with MD 331 (Shiloh Church Hurlock Road) in the hamlet of Shiloh Church.  MD 14 and MD 331 head east in a concurrency to the community of Rhodesdale, where MD 331 splits to the southeast toward Vienna as Rhodesdale Vienna Road.  MD 14 crosses an unused rail right-of-way owned by [[Delmarva Power|Delmarva Power and Light Company]] and continues east as Rhodesdale Eldorado Road.  The state highway curves northeast and briefly passes through the town of [[Brookview, Maryland|Brookview]] before crossing [[Marshyhope Creek]] on the Brookview Bridge.  Shortly after crossing the creek, MD 14 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 313 in the town of Eldorado.

The state highway runs {{convert|11.51|mi|km}} from [[Maryland Route 16|MD 16]] near [[Secretary, Maryland|Secretary]] east to [[Maryland Route 313|MD 313]] in [[Eldorado, Maryland|Eldorado]].  MD 14 connects those two towns with the towns of [[East New Market, Maryland|East New Market]] and [[Brookview, Maryland|Brookview]] in northern [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]].  The state highway also shares a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Maryland Route 331|MD 331]] between the communities of [[Rhodesdale, Maryland|Rhodesdale]] and [[Shiloh Church, Maryland|Shiloh Church]].  The sections of MD 14 between East New Market and Eldorado were constructed between 1911 and 1914.  The highway through Secretary was constructed in the late 1920s.  The portion of MD 14 east of Shiloh Church was first marked as part of [[U.S. Route 213]] (US 213) in 1927.  In the early 1930s, US 213 was rerouted through [[Vienna, Maryland|Vienna]]; as a result, MD 14 was extended to its present eastern terminus in Eldorado.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2017-08-21 10 52 48 View west along Maryland State Route 14 (Railroad Avenue) at Jenkins Street in East New Market, Dorchester County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|View west along MD 14 in East New Market]]\nMD 14 begins at an intersection with MD 16 (Mt. Holly Road) a short distance west of East New Market.  The state highway heads north as Secretary Road in a straight line before curving to the east and crossing the [[Warwick River (Maryland)|Warwick River]], where the highway's name changes to Main Street and the route enters the town of Secretary.  MD 14 intersects Poplar Street, which leads to the [[suicide bridge]] over Cabin Creek, before leaving the town.<ref name=\"Suicide Bridge\"/>  The state highway's name changes to Secretary East New Market Road as the road turns southeast toward the second town.  MD 14 passes through East New Market on Academy Road and Railroad Avenue, with the name change occurring at the center of town at the highway's second intersection with MD 16, known at this point as Main Street.  After intersecting [[Maryland Route 392|MD 392]] (East New Market Bypass) and crossing the Seaford Line of the [[Maryland and Delaware Railroad]], MD 14 leaves the town limits of East New Market.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 14\"/>\n\nMD 14 continues east as East New Market Rhodesdale Road.  The state highway passes [[North Dorchester High School]] before the western intersection with MD 331 (Shiloh Church Hurlock Road) in the hamlet of Shiloh Church.  MD 14 and MD 331 head east in a concurrency to the community of Rhodesdale, where MD 331 splits to the southeast toward Vienna as Rhodesdale Vienna Road.  MD 14 crosses an unused rail right-of-way owned by [[Delmarva Power|Delmarva Power and Light Company]] and continues east as Rhodesdale Eldorado Road.  The state highway curves northeast and briefly passes through the town of [[Brookview, Maryland|Brookview]] before crossing [[Marshyhope Creek]] on the Brookview Bridge.  Shortly after crossing the creek, MD 14 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 313 in the town of Eldorado.

It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a mid-1950s [[New York County Courthouse]], a visibly bored [[judge]] instructs a jury about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last = Semple | first = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''.

Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|''The Odd Couple'']], starring Jack Klugman (Juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in \"The Jury Story\". The comedy series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' paid homage to the movie in the episode \"Jury Duty\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1957]]\n* [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|''12 Angry Men'' (1997 film)]]\n* ''[[Twelve Angry Men]]''\n* [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes]], a film review aggregator website\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php |title=National Film Registry |date=September 12, 2011 |publisher=National Film Registry (National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress) |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419221742/http://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Sidney Lumet|Lumet, Sidney]] (1995).

It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a mid-1950s [[New York County Courthouse]], a visibly bored [[judge]] instructs a jury about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''. ''[[The Flintstones]]'' story \"Disorder in the Court\" and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' story \"[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (The Simpsons)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]\" similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. ''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|''The Odd Couple'']], starring Jack Klugman (Juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in \"The Jury Story\".

After the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|1895 defeat]] of the [[Republic of Formosa]], the [[Empire of Japan]] annexed Taiwan. The early Japanese administration appointed military governors. The colonial policies often limited the human rights of the [[Taiwanese people]].\nAfter the [[Tapani incident]] in 1915 and Japan's involvement in [[World War I]], the colonial governance was gradually liberalized. Taiwan became an extension of the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] and the [[Taiwanese people]] were educated under a policy of assimilation.\n\nThe last phase of Japanese rule began with the eruption of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. As the Japanese became active in international military affairs, its [[Japanese militarism|militarism]] rose. Its goal now was to fully Japanize Taiwan. In the meantime, laws were made to grant Taiwanese membership in the [[Japanese Diet]], which theoretically would qualify a Taiwanese to become the prime minister of Japan eventually.\n\n===Taiwan under the Republic of China===\nSome of the autocracy in early [[Republic of China|Nationalist China]] also reflects a continuation of the political attitudes of Taiwan in the early decades after its founding in 1912. Many Chinese leaders, following the thought of [[Sun Yat-sen]], held it necessary to maintain strong centralized control, including a militarized regime, during the early part of the regime's history, feeling that the populace was \"not ready\" for full democracy. Political repression was heavy during the early Kuomintang-Taiwan period in the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek, who would retreat to Taiwan following the [[Chinese Civil War]].\n\nAdditionally, the history of Taiwan after 1945, in terms of political situation and human rights, displays multiple similarities with that of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] (South Korea). Between the end of [[World War II]] and the 1980s, a similar degree of autocracy and centralization existed, followed by eventual democratization by two states. Both Taiwan and South Korea went on to become leading economic players in Asia, part of the [[Asian Tigers (economics)|Asian Tigers]], and both are now recognized as relatively free societies with successful human rights developments in most areas.\n\nThe [[Asian values]] debate, which holds that the political and cultural traditions of Asia justify a certain degree of autocratic rule to enable the rapid economic development of society puts Taiwanese human rights in interesting perspective. These ideas were prevalent among many important leaders in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and elsewhere with seemingly Western-style democratic Constitutions coupled with authoritarian one-party rule, in the 1990s. Moreover, some in mainland China, including [[Peking University]] scholar Pan Wei Bo, feel the most effective and appropriate political structure for the Chinese people is a relatively centralized state under rule of law, with some degree of popular consultation. There are also debates as to the government's right to police social behaviours. For instance, [[Lee Chiao-Ju|a municipal councillor]] suggested that Taiwan's low fertility rate could be alleviated by making employers penalise unmarried and childless workers; this suggestion was widely rebuked for its infringement of [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|the rights of the individual]].<ref name=taipeitimes>{{cite web | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/05/26/2003533747 | title=\u2018Married with kids\u2019 proposal draws ridicule | last1=Loa | first1=Iok-sin | website=Taipei Times | date=26 May 2012 | access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Capital punishment in Taiwan|Capital punishment]] exists in [[Taiwan]].

Instances of [[police brutality|police abuse]] of persons in [[police custody]], official [[police corruption|corruption]], [[violence]] and [[sexual discrimination|discrimination]] against women, [[child prostitution]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking of women and children]] occurred.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan's laws have focused on combating sexual discrimination, granting greater accommodation to conscientious objectors (Republic of China has obligatory national service), and upholding cultural and linguistic pluralism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/rights/preface.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312031213/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/rights/preface.htm |date=March 12, 2005 }}</ref> In 2001, the [[Ministry of Justice (Taiwan)|Ministry of Justice]] issued a draft version of the Basic Law On The Guarantees of Human Rights.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> For significant periods of Taiwan's history, both before and after 1949, when the Republic of China lost control of mainland China while only maintaining control of Taiwan, linguistic and cultural rights for minorities or non-power holding groups were often repressed. For example, local dialects such as [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] (or any other non-[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] spoken variants spoken by the Taiwanese) were restricted in the mass media to promote the use of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] as the common language.\n\n==Labor rights in Taiwan==\nThe [[labor movement in Taiwan]] began in the 1980s near the end of military rule.<ref name>{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Ming-sho|year=2006|title=CHALLENGING STATE CORPORATISM: THE POLITICS OF TAIWAN'S LABOR FEDERATION MOVEMENT|url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~msho/book.files/J9.pdf|journal=The China Journal|volume=56|pages=107\u2013127|via=|doi=10.2307/20066188|jstor=20066188}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign workers===\nThere are more than 700,000 [[guest workers]] in Taiwan. Most are from [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], and the [[Philippines]]. A murky system of recruitment and brokerage agencies leaves foreign workers vulnerable to [[debt bondage]].<ref name=\"Aspinwall 2019\" />\n\nIn March 2020 a fire at a factory killed three Vietnamese workers living in the onsite dormitory.

This responsibility for championing both the industry and protecting labor has been characterized as a conflict of interest by [[Greenpeace]]. In 2017 the Taiwanese Government introduced the Act for Distant Water Fisheries which was intended to increase government control and oversight over Taiwan\u2019s approximately 2,000 distant water fishing vessels.
