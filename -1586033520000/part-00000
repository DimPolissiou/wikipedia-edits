It consisted of 12 [[oil tanker]]s (average size 1300 tons), 15 [[bulk ore carrier]]s (average size 15000 tons), and 207 other crafts with average tonnage of 5000 to 10000.<ref>Pakistan Economist 1983 -Page 24 by S.

In the late medieval period, Somali [[navy|navies]] regularly engaged their Portuguese counterparts at sea, the latter of whom were naturally attracted by the commercial reputation of the Somali coast. These tensions significantly worsened during the 16th century.\n[[File:Medieval Mombasa.jpg|thumb|190px|right|In 1660, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in [[Mombasa]] surrendered to a joint [[Somali people|Somali]]-[[Oman]]i force.<ref>Tanzania notes and records: the journal of the Tanzania Society pg 76</ref>]]\nOver the next several decades Somali-[[Portugal|Portuguese]] tensions would remain high and the increased contact between Somali sailors and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Privateer|corsairs]] worried the Portuguese, prompting the latter to send a punitive expedition against Mogadishu under [[Portuguese Navy|Joao de Sepuvelda]]. The expedition was unsuccessful.<ref>The Portuguese period in East Africa - Page 112</ref> Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese in the [[Indian Ocean]] reached an apogee in the 1580s, when Ajuran clients of the Somali coastal cities began to sympathize with the Arabs and Swahilis under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] corsair [[Ottoman Navy|Mir Ali Bey]] for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. Bey agreed and was joined by a Somali [[Naval fleet|fleet]], which began attacking Portuguese colonies in [[Swahili Coast|Southeast Africa]].<ref>Portuguese rule and Spanish crown in South Africa, 1581-1640 - Page 25</ref> The Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as [[Pate Island|Pate]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]]. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to India requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese [[Naval fleet|armada]] managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders. However, they refrained from attacking Mogadishu.<ref>Four centuries of Swahili verse: a literary history and anthology - Page 11</ref>\n\nDuring the post-independence period, the [[Somali Navy]] mostly did [[maritime patrol]]s so as to prevent ships from illegally infringing on the nation's maritime borders. The Somali Navy and [[Somali Air Force]] also regularly collaborated as a deterrent against the [[Ethiopian Navy|Imperial Navy of Ethiopia]]. In addition, the Somali Navy carried out [[Search and Rescue]] (SAR) missions. The National Navy participated in many navy exercises with the [[United States Navy]], the [[Royal British Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.\n\n==Technology and equipment==\n[[File:Somali Mogadishan Figurehead.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Example of an historic Somali [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] from [[Mogadishu]].]]\n*'''[[Beden]]''' \u2013 The prime ancient [[Somalia|Somali]] maritime vessel that today remains the longest surviving sewn [[ship]] in [[East Africa]] and the world.{{clarify|date=October 2015}}{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The ship's construction style is unique to [[Somalia]] and significantly differs from extinct sewn ships of [[Arabia]], [[South India]] and adjacent islands.
