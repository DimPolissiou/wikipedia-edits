It was released as the album's second [[promotional single]] on May 5, 2016 on [[iTunes]] and other digital and streaming services. The song was written by duo [[Stargate (music producers)|Mikkel Eriksen]] and [[Stargate (music producers)|Tor Erik Hermansen]] of [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]], [[Kygo]], [[Priscilla Renea]], and [[Simon Wilcox]], with production handled by Eriksen, Hermansen, and Kygo. It is a [[mid-tempo]], [[tropical house]] number that uses [[synths]], [[tambourines]], an [[acoustic guitar]], and finger-snaps as its [[instrumentation]]. [[Music journalism|Critics]] noted that it had a slower melody from the group\u2019s previous songs.\n\nLyrically, the song uses the human body as a metaphor to tell a lover to expose their strengths, flaws, and truths. Inspired by the lack of ballads on their previous records, the group wanted to create more variety and a different atmosphere that their public have not heard before. \"Write on Me\" was the last promotional single before the group released their album. Upon availability, the song charted in Czech Republic and Scotland. As part of the track's promotion, the group performed the song for the first time at [[Wango Tango]], two weeks before the album's release. It was subsequently included in [[The 7/27 Tour]].\n\n==Background and production==\n\"Write on Me\" was written and co-produced by Norwegian duo [[Stargate (music producers)|Mikkel Eriksen]] and [[Stargate (music producers)|Tor Erik Hermansen]] of [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Kygo|Kyrre G\u00f8rvell-Dahll]] with additional writing from [[Priscilla Renea]] and [[Simon Wilcox]]. Other personnel involved in the production of the song include mixing engineer Phil Tan, mastering engineer Dave Kutch, assistant engineer Daniela Rivera and recording engineers Eriksen, Miles Walker and Mike Anderson. While recording music for their sophomore album, Fifth Harmony was keen in including a ballad number. Cabello told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that fans would see \"more of a vulnerable side\" to them. This was something that was not very present in their debut album, ''[[Reflection (Fifth Harmony album)|Reflection]]'' (2015). The song was released on [[Streaming media|streaming]] service [[Spotify]] and digital music platform [[iTunes]] on May 5, 2016.<ref name=\"spotifydownload\">{{cite web|title=Write On Me by Fifth Harmony|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/562vy350LSg1NuyjC8D59f|publisher=[[Spotify]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> The track was also made available on [[Google Play]] the following day.<ref name=\"Google Play\">{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Fifth_Harmony_Write_On_Me?id=Bapr5iqpc4hjry2qeyec62vu3d4|title=Fifth Harmony: Write On Me|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Google Play]]|accessdate= May 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{listen\n|filename= Fifth Harmony - Write On Me.flac\n|pos= right\n|title= Write On Me\n|description=Sample of the song's [[tropical house]] sound.

Kordei's silhouette appears as she writes in the air and her form comes to life after drawing a heart on her wrist. After her verse, the camera moves to Cabello dancing. A close up of [[Lauren Jauregui]] is then shown with a dark silhouette of Cabello abruptly switching between takes. The scene transitions as multiple thick grey and black rectangular lines move towards the chorus of the song where each member is singing in stools, snapping their fingers with a spotlight on them. Individual takes of the each member are shown.<ref name=\"TeenVog\"/>\n\nBrooke stares away from the camera, singing to a person who is not visible to the reader. She, similar to Cabello, acts in a sensual way. The guitar in the intro of the video is now in real-life form. In a [[Negative (photography)|negative special effects]], the verse changes to Cabello, who is presented in different takes, including a silhouette, a normal background and a dim [[mirror image]]. The scene changes back to where each member was previously in stools, snapping in-sync to the beat of the song. As the video progresses, the rhythm intensifies with several individual takes of the group as the grey rectangular boxes slow the beat with a moving background of a sunset and blurry blue lines depicting waves as Cabello's image disappears. Soon after, the group is clustered together dancing, depicting what appears to be a photo-booth as the screen flashes several times. The video ends with each member's silhouette making hand motions as the camera pans upwards to reveal the album's title and group's logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Write On Me - Fifth Harmony - Vevo|url=https://www.vevo.com/watch/fifth-harmony/write-on-me/USSM21600793|publisher=VEVO|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Credits and personnel==\n;Recording\n*Recorded at [[Westlake Recording Studios]] ([[Los Angeles]], [[California]]) and The Hide Out Studios ([[London]], [[England]])\n*Mixed at Callanwolde Fine Arts Center ([[Atlanta, California]])\n*Mastered at The Mastering Place (New York City)\n\n;Management\n*Published by Sony/ATV Ballad (BMI) EMI April Music Inc.
