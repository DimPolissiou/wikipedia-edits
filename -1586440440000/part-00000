In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) and L\u00e9on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/quim0.htm|title=Diocese of Quimper, France}}</ref>\n\nOriginally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 17 Mar. 2013]</ref> The earliest historical reference dates from 453. An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137. Duchesne, II, p. 247.</ref>\n\n====Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on====\n[[File:Kathedrale von Saint Pol de L\u00e8on.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Cathedral St.-Paul-Aurelian, Saint-Pol]]\nThere is evidence that Christianity was preached in L\u00e9on twenty years before the evangelization of [[Cornouaille]], but ancient Breton chronology is very uncertain. The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437). Besse, pp. 270-275.</ref>\n\n====Other churches====\nThe Cathedral of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, which is now in the Diocese of Quimper, was built between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Malo Th\u00e9ophile Peyron|title=La cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Pol et le minihy L\u00e9on|url=https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog|year=1901|publisher=A. de Kerangal|location=Quimper|language=French|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog/page/n36 28]\u201332}}  A list of the Bishops of Saint-Pol de L\u00e9on is given at pp. 6-11.</ref> The Church of Notre Dame de Creisker, in the same town, restored in the fourteenth century, has a [[Bell tower|belfry]] which the Bretons claim to be the handsomest in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Formerly Quimperl\u00e9 had an important Benedictine abbey, Sainte Croix, founded in 1029 and where the [[Benedictine]]s of St. Maur took up their residence in 1665. Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Monastic vows were abolished. [[Brest, France|Brest]], one of the great fortified harbours of France, is now in the diocese.\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: 17th and 18th centuries===\nIn 1608 Counter-Reformation preacher [[Michel Le Nobletz]] conducted his first mission on the island of Ouessant. \"Apostle of Brittany\" Father [[Julian Maunoir]] worked as a missionary to the Breton people for 43 years. Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} to be the founder of Breton philology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university.

The entire diocese contained some 180 parishes.<ref>Ritzler, VI, p. 184, note 1. Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes.</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\n\nDuring the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finist\u00e8re', which was made a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114534/http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/civilconstitution.html Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English)] Retrieved: 2016-09-02.</ref> The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement.  This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel|Jean-Baptiste Gobel]], a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

He faced great difficulties both from the flight of many of his clergy in the face of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], and from the seizure of large areas of the countryside by the [[Chouan]]s, who were loyal to the monarchy.  He had himself elected president of the departmental Directory, but his increasingly moderate stance brought him under suspicion from the [[Jacobin]]s.

A. de Kerangal|location=Quimper|language=French}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the [[Concordat of 1801]], Pope Pius VII restored the Diocese of Quimper in 1802. The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes' did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) and L\u00e9on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/quim0.htm|title=Diocese of Quimper, France}}</ref>\n\nOriginally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 17 Mar. 2013]</ref> The earliest historical reference dates from 453. An assembly of eight Bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new Bishop for Angers. Four of the Bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137. Duchesne, II, p. 247.</ref>\n\n====Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on====\n[[File:Kathedrale von Saint Pol de L\u00e8on.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Cathedral St.-Paul-Aurelian, Saint-Pol]]\nThere is evidence that Christianity was preached in L\u00e9on twenty years before the evangelization of [[Cornouaille]], but ancient Breton chronology is very uncertain. The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437).

Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Monastic vows were abolished.

Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} to be the founder of Breton philology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university.

The entire diocese contained some 180 parishes.<ref>Ritzler, VI, p. 184, note 1. Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes.</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\n\nDuring the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finist\u00e8re', which was made a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114534/http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/civilconstitution.html Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English)] Retrieved: 2016-09-02.</ref> The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement.  This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel|Jean-Baptiste Gobel]], a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

He faced great difficulties both from the flight of many of his clergy in the face of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], and from the seizure of large areas of the countryside by the [[Chouan]]s, who were loyal to the monarchy.  He had himself elected president of the departmental Directory, but his increasingly moderate stance brought him under suspicion from the [[Jacobin]]s.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes' did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

He later served as the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|30th]] [[governor of Kentucky]].\n\nAfter graduating from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, participating in many of the major battles of that conflict. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law's [[real estate]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed [[adjutant general]] by Governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce [[Kentucky]]'s neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state's neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the [[Union Army]]. In 1862, he accepted [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s demand for an \"unconditional surrender\" at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]]. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in [[Braxton Bragg]]'s failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] Department.\n\nIn the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887. It was his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud]] and the [[Rowan County War]]. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]] absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for [[veto]]ing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The following year, he joined the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or \"Gold Democrats\", who favored a [[gold standard]] policy over the [[Free Silver]] position of the mainline Democrats. He was the Gold Democrats' candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1896|1896 election]], but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]]. He never again sought public office and died January 8, 1914.\n\n==Early life==\nSimon B. Buckner (Sr.), was born at Glen Lily, his family's estate near [[Munfordville, Kentucky]].<ref name=kye136>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 136</ref> He was the third child and second son of Aylett Hartswell and Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner.<ref name=stickles4>Stickles, p. 4</ref> Named after the \"South American soldier and statesman, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], then at the height of his power\",<ref name=stickles5>Stickles, p. 5</ref> Buckner did not begin school until age nine, when he enrolled at a private school in Munfordville.<ref name=stickles6>Stickles, p. 6</ref> His closest friend in Munfordville was [[Thomas J. Wood]], who would become a [[Union Army]] general opposing Buckner at the [[Battle of Perryville]] and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] during the Civil War.<ref>Noe, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Buckner's father was an iron worker, but found that Hart County did not have sufficient timber to fire his iron furnace.<ref name=stickles7>Stickles, p. 7</ref> Consequently, in 1838, he moved the family to southern [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]] where he organized an iron-making corporation.<ref name=stickles7/> Buckner attended school in [[Greenville, Kentucky|Greenville]], and later at Christian County Seminary in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]].<ref name=kye136/><ref name=stickles9>Stickles, p. 9</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 1840, Buckner enrolled at the [[United States Military Academy]].<ref name=harrison119>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 119</ref> In 1844 he graduated eleventh in his class of 25 and was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment]].<ref name=harrison119/><ref name=Eicher>Eicher, pp. 151\u201352</ref> He was assigned to garrison duty at [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackett's Harbor]] on [[Lake Ontario]] until August 28, 1845, when he returned to the Academy to serve as an assistant professor of [[geography]], [[history]], and [[ethics]].<ref>Stickles, p. 15, 24; Hewitt, p. 139</ref>\n\n==Service in the Mexican\u2013American War==\nIn May 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], enlisting with the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Infantry Regiment]]. His early duties included recruiting soldiers and bringing them to the [[Texas]] border. In November 1846, he was ordered to join his [[company (military unit)|company]] in the field; he met them en route between [[Monclova]] and [[Parras (municipality)|Parras]]. The company joined [[John E. Wool]] at [[Saltillo]]. In January 1847, Buckner was ordered to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] with [[William J. Worth]]'s [[division (military)|division]]. While [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Winfield Scott]] [[Siege of Veracruz|besieged Vera Cruz]], Buckner's unit engaged a few thousand Mexican cavalry at a nearby town called Amazoque.<ref>Stickles, pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 1847, Buckner was appointed [[quartermaster]] of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, he participated in battles at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]], being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He was appointed a brevet [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] for gallantry at Churubusco and [[Battle of Contreras|Contreras]], but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error\u2014he had been fighting in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.<ref name=stickles17>Stickles, p. 17</ref>\n\nBuckner was again cited for gallant conduct at the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]], and was appointed a brevet [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]]. He participated in the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], the Battle of Belen Gate, and the [[Battle for Mexico City|storming of Mexico City]]. At the conclusion of the war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which left them time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the [[Aztec Club of 1847|Aztec Club]], and in April 1848 was a part of the successful expedition of <!--to the mountain in general? to its peak?-->[[Popocat\u00e9petl]], a volcano southeast of [[Mexico City]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 17\u201319</ref> Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.<ref name=Hewitt139>Hewitt, p. 139</ref>\n\n==Interbellum==\nAfter the war, Buckner accepted an invitation to return to West Point to teach infantry tactics.<ref name=stickles20>Stickles, p. 20</ref> Just over a year later, he resigned the post in protest over the academy's compulsory chapel attendance policy.<ref name=stickles22>Stickles, p. 22</ref> Following his resignation, he was assigned to a recruiting post at [[Fort Columbus]].<ref name=stickles23>Stickles, p. 23</ref>\n\nBuckner married Mary Jane Kingsbury on May 2, 1850, at her aunt's home in [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]]. Shortly after their wedding, he was assigned to [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] and later to Fort Atkinson on the [[Arkansas River]] in present-day [[Kansas]]. On December 31, 1851, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and on November 3, 1852, he was elevated to captain of the commissary department of the 6th U.S. Infantry in [[New York City]].<ref name=Hewitt139/> Previously, he had attained only a brevet to these ranks. Buckner gained such a reputation for fair dealings with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], that the [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe called him Young Chief, and their leader, [[Yellow Bear]], refused to [[treaty|treat]] with anyone but Buckner.<ref>Stickles, pp. 25\u201329</ref>\n\nBefore leaving the Army, Buckner helped an old friend from West Point and the Mexican\u2013American War, Captain [[Ulysses S. Grant]], by covering his expenses at a New York hotel until money arrived from Ohio to pay for his passage home. On March 26, 1855, Buckner resigned from the Army to work with his father-in-law, who had extensive real estate holdings in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. When his father-in-law died in 1856, Buckner inherited his property and moved to Chicago to manage it.<ref>Stickles, pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\nStill interested in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]]. On April 3, 1857, he was appointed [[adjutant general]] of [[Illinois]] by [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[William Henry Bissell]]. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the [[Mormonism|Mormons]]. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.<ref name=stickles8>Stickles, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn late 1857, Buckner and his family returned to his native state and settled in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Buckner's daughter, Lily, was born there on March 7, 1858. Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens' Guard was formed, and Buckner was made its captain. He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard's Second Regiment.<ref>Stickles, pp. 41\u201343</ref> He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.<ref name=Hewitt139/>\n\n==Civil War==\nIn 1861 Kentucky governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him to [[Militia General (CSA)|major general]], and charged him with revising the state's militia laws.<ref name=powell68>Powell, p. 68</ref><ref name=nga>\"Kentucky Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner\", National Governors Association</ref> The state was torn between [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], with the legislature supporting the former and the governor the latter. This led the state to declare itself officially [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]. Buckner assembled 61&nbsp;[[Company (military unit)|companies]] to defend Kentucky's neutrality.<ref name=powell68/>\n\nThe state board that controlled the militia considered it to be pro-[[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] and ordered it to store its arms.<ref name=stickles78>Stickles, p. 78</ref> On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that he could no longer perform his duties due to the board's actions.<ref name=stickles78/> That August he was twice offered a commission as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[Union Army]]\u2014the first from general in chief [[Winfield Scott]], and the second from [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]] following the personal order of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2014but he declined.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 44; Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 120; Hewitt, p. 140</ref> After Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Leonidas Polk]] occupied [[Columbus, Kentucky]], violating the state's neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] on September 14, 1861, and was followed by many of the men he formerly commanded in the state militia.<ref name=Eicher/><ref>Gott, p. 37</ref> When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action might be taken against his wife's property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.)<ref name=Hewitt140>Hewitt, p. 140</ref> He became a [[division (military)|division]] commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]] and was stationed in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>Gott, p. 38</ref>\n\n===Fort Donelson===\nAfter Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant [[Battle of Fort Henry|captured Fort Henry]] on the [[Tennessee River]] in February 1862, he turned his sights on nearby [[Fort Donelson]] on the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]]. [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] commander [[Full General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] sent Buckner to be one of four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice [[John B. Floyd]]; Buckner's peers were [[Gideon J. Pillow]] and [[Bushrod Johnson]].<ref>Gott, pp. 133\u201335</ref>\n\nBuckner's division defended the right flank of the Confederate line of entrenchments that surrounded the fort and the small town of [[Dover, Tennessee]]. On February 14, the Confederate generals decided they could not hold the fort and planned a breakout, hoping to join with Johnston's army, now in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant's army, pushing it back {{convert|1|to|2|mi|sigfig=1}}. Buckner, not confident of his army's chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his supporting attack for over two hours, which gave Grant's men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner's delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for an escape from the besieged fort. However, Floyd and Pillow combined to undo the day's work by ordering the troops back to their trench positions.<ref>Gott, pp. 191\u2013217; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\nLate that night the generals held a [[council of war]] in which Floyd and Pillow expressed satisfaction with the events of the day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for [[treason]] if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].<ref>Gott, pp. 238\u201349; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 123\u201324</ref>\n\nThat morning, Buckner sent a messenger to the Union Army requesting an armistice and a meeting of commissioners to work out surrender terms.<ref name=stickles164>Stickles, p. 164</ref> He may have been hoping Grant would offer generous terms, remembering the assistance he gave Grant when he was destitute, but Grant's reply was curt. Sending his aide [[William S. Hillyer|Colonel William Hillyer]] to deliver a dispatch in person, Grant's reply included his famous quotation, \"No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.\"<ref>Stickles, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> To this, Buckner responded:\n\n{{Quote|SIR:\u2014The distribution of the forces under my command, incident to an unexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming force under your command, compel me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the Confederate arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrous terms which you propose.<ref>Gott, p. 257</ref>}}\n\nThe asperity of these notes was only superficial; Buckner greeted his old friend warmly when Grant arrived to accept the surrender. They joked about their time in Mexico and the incompetence of General Pillow.<ref>[http://www.granthomepage.com/intbuckner.htm Hamlin Garland Papers, Doheny Library, University of Southern California]</ref> Grant offered to loan Buckner money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. As mentioned above, Buckner had paid for then-Captain Grant's lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. As evidence of their mutual respect, Buckner later acted as a pall bearer and paid for Grant's funeral in 1885, as well as provided Grant's widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000&nbsp;men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville.<ref>Gott, pp. 262\u201367</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Kentucky===\nWhile Buckner was a Union [[prisoner of war]] at [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in [[Boston]], Kentucky [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Garrett Davis]] unsuccessfully sought to have him tried for treason.<ref name=powell68/> On August 15, 1862, after five months of writing poetry in solitary confinement, Buckner was exchanged for Union Brig. Gen. [[George A. McCall]].<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Eicher, p. 152</ref> The following day he was promoted to [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Major general|major general]]<ref name=stickles192>Stickles, p. 192</ref> and ordered to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to join Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s [[Army of Mississippi]].<ref>Stickles, p. 194; Hewitt, p. 140</ref>\n\nDays after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] began an invasion of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner's home town of [[Battle of Munfordville|Munfordville]]. The small town was important for Union forces to hold if they wanted to maintain communication with Louisville while pressing  southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. [[John T. Wilder]] guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12&nbsp;and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to ask him what he should do. Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder's men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be \"no less than willful murder.\"<ref>Noe, p. 70; Stickles, pp. 194\u2013202; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 229\u201330; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nBragg's men continued northward to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]] where they rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]], the main Union force in the state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where he was able to attend the [[inauguration]] of Confederate Governor [[Richard Hawes]] on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.<ref>McDonough, p. 200; Noe, p. 129</ref>\n\n[[File:Perryville 1545.png|thumb|[[Battle of Perryville]]: Actions in Buckner's sector (~ 3:45&nbsp;p.m.)\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nBased on intelligence acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville in the town of [[Mackville, Kentucky|Mackville]]. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at [[Perryville, Kentucky|Perryville]], but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army\u2014not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's\u2014engaged Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Alexander McCook's]] corps of Buell's army and began the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.<ref>Stickles, pp. 204\u2013208; Noe, pp. 219\u201328, 339; McDonough, pp. 258\u201361; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 264\u201367</ref>\n\n===Later Civil War service===\nFollowing the Battle of Perryville, Buckner was reassigned to command the District of the Gulf, fortifying the defenses of [[Mobile, Alabama]].<ref name=Eicher/> He remained there until late April 1863, when he was ordered to take command of the Army of East Tennessee.<ref name=stickles213>Stickles, p. 213</ref> He arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on May 11, 1863, and assumed command the following day.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Stickles, p. 216</ref> Shortly thereafter, his department was converted into a district of the Department of Tennessee under Gen. Bragg and was designated the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 149; Stickles, p. 220</ref>\n\nIn late August, Union Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] approached Buckner's position at Knoxville. Buckner called for reinforcements from Bragg at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], but Bragg was being threatened by forces under Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] and could not spare any of his men. Bragg ordered Buckner to fall back to the [[Hiwassee River]]. From there, Buckner's unit traveled to Bragg's supply base at [[Ringgold, Georgia]], then on to [[Lafayette, Georgia|Lafayette]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]]. Bragg was also forced from Chattanooga and joined Buckner at Chickamauga. On September 19&nbsp;and 20, the Confederate forces attacked and emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Buckner's Corps fought on the Confederate left both days, the second under the \"wing\" command of Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], participating in the great breakthrough of the Union line.<ref>Stickles, pp. 226\u2013231; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 201\u201334; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 454\u201362; Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp. 89, 93\u201394</ref>\n\nAfter Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his [[Army of the Cumberland]] retreated to fortified Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, but refused to take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a [[Chattanooga Campaign#Opening the Cracker Line|tenuous supply line]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp. 129\u201368</ref> Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner was the author of the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 239</ref> Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Cozzens, ''Shipwreck of Their Hopes'', p. 24; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 252\u201353; Hewitt, pp. 140\u201341</ref>\n\nBuckner was given a medical leave of absence following Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the [[Knoxville Campaign]], while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]]. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]'s division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, pp. 241\u2013249</ref> The department was a shell of its former self\u2014less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and in no position to mount an offensive.<ref name=stickles250>Stickles, p. 250</ref> Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.<ref>Stickles, p. 252; Hewitt, p. 141</ref>\n\nBuckner had difficulty traveling to the West, and it was early summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], Smith began requesting a promotion for him.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, p. 256</ref> The promotion to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] came on September 20.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Smith placed Buckner in charge of the critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through enemy lines.<ref name=stickles262>Stickles, p. 262</ref>\n\nAs news of Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender, on April 9, 1865, reached the department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner his chief of staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the [[Rio Grande]], he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender.<ref>Stickles, p. 265\u2013270; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas.<ref name=winters425>Winters, p. 425</ref>\n\nAt Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Buckner had become the first Confederate general of the war to surrender an army; at New Orleans, he became the last.<ref name=foote>Foote, p. 1021</ref> The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2, (Only Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]] held out longer; he surrendered the last Confederate land forces on June 23, 1865).<ref name=foote/>\n\nConditions set forth in Buckner's surrender were the following:\n\n# \"All acts of hostility on the part of both armies are to cease from this date.\"\n# The officers and men are to be \"paroled until duly exchanged.\"\n# All Confederate property was to be turned over to the Union.\n# All officers and men could return home.\n# \"The surrender of property will not include the side arms or private horses or baggage of officers\" and enlisted men.\n# \"All 'self-disposed persons' who return to 'peaceful pursuits' are assured that may resume their usual avocations . . . \".\"<ref>Winters, p. 226</ref>\n\n==Postbellum life==\nThe terms of Buckner's parole in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], on June 9, 1865, prevented his return to Kentucky for three years. He remained in New Orleans, worked on the staff of the ''Daily Crescent'' newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served on the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867.<ref name=Eicher/><ref name=stickles282>Stickles, p. 282</ref> His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he sent them back to Kentucky in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=stickles281>Stickles, p. 281</ref>\n\nBuckner returned to Kentucky when he was eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville ''Courier''.<ref name=Eicher/> Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the [[United States Congress]] for the restoration of his [[civil rights]] as stipulated by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. He recovered most of his property through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.<ref name=kye136/>\n\nOn January 5, 1874, after five years of suffering with [[tuberculosis]], Buckner's wife died. Now a widower, Buckner continued to live in Louisville until 1877 when he and his daughter Lily returned to the family estate, Glen Lily, in Munfordville. His sister, a recent widow, also returned to the estate in 1877. For six years, these three inhabited and repaired the house and grounds which had been neglected during the war and its aftermath. On June 14, 1883, Lily Buckner married [[Morris B. Belknap]] of Louisville, and the couple made their residence in Louisville. On October 10 of the same year, Buckner's sister died, and he was left alone.<ref>Stickles, pp. 313\u2013322</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1885, Buckner married Delia Claiborne of [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=stickles324>Stickles, p. 324</ref> Buckner was 62; Claiborne was 28.<ref name=stickles323/> Their son, [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], was born on July 18, 1886.<ref name=stickles332>Stickles, p. 332</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nBuckner had a keen interest in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] for president.<ref name=stickles297>Stickles, p. 297</ref> Though Buckner had favored [[George H. Pendleton]], he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.<ref name=stickles298>Stickles, p. 298, 318</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Buckner was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.<ref name=tapp213>Tapp, p. 213</ref> Other prominent candidates included [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Thomas Laurens Jones]], former congressman [[J. Proctor Knott]], and [[List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville mayor]] [[Charles Donald Jacob]].<ref name=tapp213/> Buckner consistently ran third in the first six ballots, but withdrew his name from consideration before the seventh ballot.<ref name=tapp213/><ref name=stickles319>Stickles, p. 319</ref> The delegation from [[Owsley County, Kentucky|Owsley County]] switched their support to Knott, starting a wave of defections that resulted in Jones' withdrawal and Knott's unanimous nomination.<ref name=tapp213/> Knott went on to win the general election and appointed Buckner to the board of trustees for the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the [[University of Kentucky]]) in 1884.<ref>Stickles, pp. 322\u2013323</ref> At that year's state Democratic convention, he served on the committee on credentials.<ref name=stickles323>Stickles, p. 323</ref>\n\n===Governor of Kentucky===\n[[File:Governor Simon B Buckner.jpg|thumb|Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner|alt=A color portrait of an older gentleman with white hair and a white goatee]]\nDelegates to the 1887 state Democratic convention nominated Buckner unanimously for the office of governor. A week later, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] chose [[William O. Bradley]] as their candidate. The [[Prohibition Party]] and the Union Labor Party also nominated candidates for governor. The official results of the election gave Buckner a plurality of 16,797 over Bradley.<ref>Stickles, pp. 336\u2013344</ref>\n\nBuckner proposed a number of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] ideas, most of which were rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', pp. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nMuch of Buckner's time was spent trying to curb violence in the eastern part of the state. Shortly after his inauguration, the [[Rowan County War]] escalated to vigilantism, when residents of the county organized a posse and killed several of the leaders of the feud. Though this essentially ended the feud, the violence had been so bad that Buckner's adjutant general recommended that the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] dissolve Rowan County, though this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1888, a posse from Kentucky entered [[West Virginia]] and killed a leader of the Hatfield clan in the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. This caused a political conflict between Buckner and [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Emanuel Willis Wilson]] of [[West Virginia]], who complained that the raid was illegal. The matter was adjudicated in federal court, and Buckner was cleared of any connection to the raid. Later in Buckner's term, feuds broke out in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher]], [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry]], [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott]], and [[Breathitt County, Kentucky|Breathitt]] counties.<ref>Stickles, pp. 348\u2013355, 367</ref>\n\nA major financial scandal erupted in 1888 when Buckner ordered a routine audit of the state's finances which had been neglected for years.<ref name=kye136/> The audit showed that the state's longtime treasurer, [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]], had been mismanaging and [[embezzlement|embezzling]] the state's money since 1872.<ref name=kye136/> Faced with the prospect that his malfeasance would be discovered, Tate absconded with nearly $250,000 of state funds.<ref name=kye136/> He was never found.<ref name=stickles358>Stickles, p. 358</ref> The General Assembly immediately began [[impeachment]] hearings against Tate, convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and removed him from office.<ref name=stickles358/> State auditor Fayette Hewitt was [[censure]]d for neglecting the duty of his office, but was not implicated in Tate's theft or disappearance.<ref name=stickles355>Stickles, p. 355</ref>\n\nDuring the 1888&nbsp;session, the General Assembly passed 1,571&nbsp;bills, exceeding the total passed by any other session in the state's history. Only about 150&nbsp;of these bills were of a general nature; the rest were special interest bills passed for the private gain of legislators and those in their constituencies. Buckner [[veto]]ed 60&nbsp;of these special interest bills, more than had been vetoed by the previous ten governors combined. Only one of these vetoes was overridden by the legislature. Ignoring Buckner's clear intent to veto special interest bills, the 1890&nbsp;legislature passed 300&nbsp;more special interest bills than had its predecessor. Buckner vetoed 50&nbsp;of these. His reputation for rejecting special interest bills led the Kelley Axe Factory, the largest axe factory in the country at the time, to present him with a ceremonial \"Veto Hatchet\".<ref>Stickles, pp. 360\u2013361, 374\u2013375</ref>\n\nWhen a tax cut passed over Buckner's veto in 1890&nbsp;drained the state treasury, the governor loaned the state enough money to remain solvent until tax revenue came in.<ref name=kye136/> Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention.<ref name=kye136/> In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor's appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.<ref name=harrison121>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 121</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter his term as governor, Buckner returned to Glen Lily.<ref name=kye136/> In 1895, he was one of four candidates nominated for a seat in the U.S. Senate&nbsp;\u2014 the others being the incumbent, [[Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn|J. C. S. Blackburn]]; outgoing governor [[John Y. Brown (1835\u20131904)|John Y. Brown]]; and congressman [[James B. McCreary]].<ref name=stickles402>Stickles, p. 402</ref> The Democratic party split over the issue of [[bimetalism]].<ref name=harrison122>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 122</ref> Buckner advocated for a gold standard, but the majority of Kentuckians advocated \"[[Free Silver]]\".<ref name=stickles403>Stickles, p. 403</ref> Seeing that he would not be able to win the seat in light of this opposition, he withdrew from the race in July 1895.<ref name=stickles403/> In spite of his withdrawal, he still received 9&nbsp;of the 134&nbsp;votes cast in the General Assembly.<ref name=tapp357>Tapp, p. 357</ref>\n\nAt the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, the Democrats nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] [[William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1896|for president]] and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver. [[Gold standard]] Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party\u2014the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or Gold Democrats\u2014which Buckner joined. At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed as a candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party's national convention in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. Former Union general [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]] was chosen as the party's nominee for [[President of the United States|president]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 408\u2013409</ref>\n\nPalmer and Buckner both had developed reputations as independent executives while serving as governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the ''[[Chicago Chronicle]]'', ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', ''[[Richmond Times]]'', and ''[[New Orleans Picayune]]''. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79&nbsp;and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over one percent of the vote in the election.<ref name=beito566>Beito, pp. 563\u2013566</ref>\n\n[[File:Glen-Lily.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A house of wooden construction with a wrap-around front porch and trees in the front yard|Glen Lily, the house where Buckner was born and died]]\nFollowing this defeat, Buckner retired to Glen Lily but remained active in politics. Though he always claimed membership in the Democratic party, he opposed the [[political machine|machine politics]] of [[William Goebel]], his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[J. C. W. Beckham]]. When the Democrats again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]], Buckner openly supported Bryan's opponent, Republican [[William Howard Taft]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 416\u2013421</ref>\n\nAt 80&nbsp;years of age, Buckner memorized five of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays because [[cataract]]s threatened to blind him, but an operation saved his sight.<ref name=harrison121/> On a visit to the [[White House]] in 1904, Buckner asked President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to appoint [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|his only son]] as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed.<ref>Stickles, pp. 420\u2013421</ref> His son Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by enemy fire during [[World War II]].<ref>Hughes, p. 137</ref>\n\nFollowing the deaths of [[Stephen D.

He later served as the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|30th]] [[governor of Kentucky]].\n\nAfter graduating from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, participating in many of the major battles of that conflict. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law's [[real estate]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed [[adjutant general]] by Governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce [[Kentucky]]'s neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state's neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the [[Union Army]]. In 1862, he accepted [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s demand for an \"unconditional surrender\" at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]]. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in [[Braxton Bragg]]'s failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] Department.\n\nIn the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887. It was his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud]] and the [[Rowan County War]]. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]] absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for [[veto]]ing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The following year, he joined the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or \"Gold Democrats\", who favored a [[gold standard]] policy over the [[Free Silver]] position of the mainline Democrats. He was the Gold Democrats' candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1896|1896 election]], but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]]. He never again sought public office and died January 8, 1914.\n\n==Early life==\nSimon B. Buckner (Sr.), was born at Glen Lily, his family's estate near [[Munfordville, Kentucky]].<ref name=kye136>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 136</ref> He was the third child and second son of Aylett Hartswell and Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner.<ref name=stickles4>Stickles, p. 4</ref> Named after the \"South American soldier and statesman, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], then at the height of his power\",<ref name=stickles5>Stickles, p. 5</ref> Buckner did not begin school until age nine, when he enrolled at a private school in Munfordville.<ref name=stickles6>Stickles, p. 6</ref> His closest friend in Munfordville was [[Thomas J. Wood]], who would become a [[Union Army]] general opposing Buckner at the [[Battle of Perryville]] and the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] during the Civil War.<ref>Noe, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Buckner's father was an iron worker, but found that Hart County did not have sufficient timber to fire his iron furnace.<ref name=stickles7>Stickles, p. 7</ref> Consequently, in 1838, he moved the family to southern [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]] where he organized an iron-making corporation.<ref name=stickles7/> Buckner attended school in [[Greenville, Kentucky|Greenville]], and later at Christian County Seminary in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]].<ref name=kye136/><ref name=stickles9>Stickles, p. 9</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 1840, Buckner enrolled at the [[United States Military Academy]].<ref name=harrison119>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 119</ref> In 1844 he graduated eleventh in his class of 25 and was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment]].<ref name=harrison119/><ref name=Eicher>Eicher, pp. 151\u201352</ref> He was assigned to garrison duty at [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackett's Harbor]] on [[Lake Ontario]] until August 28, 1845, when he returned to the Academy to serve as an assistant professor of [[geography]], [[history]], and [[ethics]].<ref>Stickles, p. 15, 24; Hewitt, p. 139</ref>\n\n==Service in the Mexican\u2013American War==\nIn May 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], enlisting with the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Infantry Regiment]]. His early duties included recruiting soldiers and bringing them to the [[Texas]] border. In November 1846, he was ordered to join his [[company (military unit)|company]] in the field; he met them en route between [[Monclova]] and [[Parras (municipality)|Parras]]. The company joined [[John E. Wool]] at [[Saltillo]]. In January 1847, Buckner was ordered to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] with [[William J. Worth]]'s [[division (military)|division]]. While [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Winfield Scott]] [[Siege of Veracruz|besieged Vera Cruz]], Buckner's unit engaged a few thousand Mexican cavalry at a nearby town called Amazoque.<ref>Stickles, pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 1847, Buckner was appointed [[quartermaster]] of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, he participated in battles at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]], being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He was appointed a brevet [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] for gallantry at Churubusco and [[Battle of Contreras|Contreras]], but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error\u2014he had been fighting in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.<ref name=stickles17>Stickles, p. 17</ref>\n\nBuckner was again cited for gallant conduct at the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]], and was appointed a brevet [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]]. He participated in the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], the Battle of Belen Gate, and the [[Battle for Mexico City|storming of Mexico City]]. At the conclusion of the war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which left them time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the [[Aztec Club of 1847|Aztec Club]], and in April 1848 was a part of the successful expedition of <!--to the mountain in general? to its peak?-->[[Popocat\u00e9petl]], a volcano southeast of [[Mexico City]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 17\u201319</ref> Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.<ref name=Hewitt139>Hewitt, p. 139</ref>\n\n==Interbellum==\nAfter the war, Buckner accepted an invitation to return to West Point to teach infantry tactics.<ref name=stickles20>Stickles, p. 20</ref> Just over a year later, he resigned the post in protest over the academy's compulsory chapel attendance policy.<ref name=stickles22>Stickles, p. 22</ref> Following his resignation, he was assigned to a recruiting post at [[Fort Columbus]].<ref name=stickles23>Stickles, p. 23</ref>\n\nBuckner married Mary Jane Kingsbury on May 2, 1850, at her aunt's home in [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]]. Shortly after their wedding, he was assigned to [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] and later to Fort Atkinson on the [[Arkansas River]] in present-day [[Kansas]]. On December 31, 1851, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and on November 3, 1852, he was elevated to captain of the commissary department of the 6th U.S. Infantry in [[New York City]].<ref name=Hewitt139/> Previously, he had attained only a brevet to these ranks. Buckner gained such a reputation for fair dealings with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], that the [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe called him Young Chief, and their leader, [[Yellow Bear]], refused to [[treaty|treat]] with anyone but Buckner.<ref>Stickles, pp. 25\u201329</ref>\n\nBefore leaving the Army, Buckner helped an old friend from West Point and the Mexican\u2013American War, Captain [[Ulysses S. Grant]], by covering his expenses at a New York hotel until money arrived from Ohio to pay for his passage home. On March 26, 1855, Buckner resigned from the Army to work with his father-in-law, who had extensive real estate holdings in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. When his father-in-law died in 1856, Buckner inherited his property and moved to Chicago to manage it.<ref>Stickles, pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\nStill interested in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]]. On April 3, 1857, he was appointed [[adjutant general]] of [[Illinois]] by [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[William Henry Bissell]]. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the [[Mormonism|Mormons]]. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.<ref name=stickles8>Stickles, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn late 1857, Buckner and his family returned to his native state and settled in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Buckner's daughter, Lily, was born there on March 7, 1858. Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens' Guard was formed, and Buckner was made its captain. He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard's Second Regiment.<ref>Stickles, pp. 41\u201343</ref> He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.<ref name=Hewitt139/>\n\n==Civil War==\nIn 1861 Kentucky governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him to [[Militia General (CSA)|major general]], and charged him with revising the state's militia laws.<ref name=powell68>Powell, p. 68</ref><ref name=nga>\"Kentucky Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner\", National Governors Association</ref> The state was torn between [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], with the legislature supporting the former and the governor the latter. This led the state to declare itself officially [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]. Buckner assembled 61&nbsp;[[Company (military unit)|companies]] to defend Kentucky's neutrality.<ref name=powell68/>\n\nThe state board that controlled the militia considered it to be pro-[[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] and ordered it to store its arms.<ref name=stickles78>Stickles, p. 78</ref> On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that he could no longer perform his duties due to the board's actions.<ref name=stickles78/> That August he was twice offered a commission as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[Union Army]]\u2014the first from general in chief [[Winfield Scott]], and the second from [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]] following the personal order of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2014but he declined.<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 44; Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 120; Hewitt, p. 140</ref> After Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Leonidas Polk]] occupied [[Columbus, Kentucky]], violating the state's neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] on September 14, 1861, and was followed by many of the men he formerly commanded in the state militia.<ref name=Eicher/><ref>Gott, p. 37</ref> When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action might be taken against his wife's property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.)<ref name=Hewitt140>Hewitt, p. 140</ref> He became a [[division (military)|division]] commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]] and was stationed in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>Gott, p. 38</ref>\n\n===Fort Donelson===\nAfter Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant [[Battle of Fort Henry|captured Fort Henry]] on the [[Tennessee River]] in February 1862, he turned his sights on nearby [[Fort Donelson]] on the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]]. [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] commander [[Full General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] sent Buckner to be one of four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice [[John B. Floyd]]; Buckner's peers were [[Gideon J. Pillow]] and [[Bushrod Johnson]].<ref>Gott, pp. 133\u201335</ref>\n\nBuckner's division defended the right flank of the Confederate line of entrenchments that surrounded the fort and the small town of [[Dover, Tennessee]]. On February 14, the Confederate generals decided they could not hold the fort and planned a breakout, hoping to join with Johnston's army, now in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant's army, pushing it back {{convert|1|to|2|mi|sigfig=1}}. Buckner, not confident of his army's chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his supporting attack for over two hours, which gave Grant's men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner's delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for an escape from the besieged fort. However, Floyd and Pillow combined to undo the day's work by ordering the troops back to their trench positions.<ref>Gott, pp. 191\u2013217; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\nLate that night the generals held a [[council of war]] in which Floyd and Pillow expressed satisfaction with the events of the day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for [[treason]] if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]] regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].<ref>Gott, pp. 238\u201349; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 123\u201324</ref>\n\nThat morning, Buckner sent a messenger to the Union Army requesting an armistice and a meeting of commissioners to work out surrender terms.<ref name=stickles164>Stickles, p. 164</ref> He may have been hoping Grant would offer generous terms, remembering the assistance he gave Grant when he was destitute, but Grant's reply was curt. Sending his aide [[William S. Hillyer|Colonel William Hillyer]] to deliver a dispatch in person, Grant's reply included his famous quotation, \"No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.\"<ref>Stickles, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> To this, Buckner responded:\n\n{{Quote|SIR:\u2014The distribution of the forces under my command, incident to an unexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming force under your command, compel me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the Confederate arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrous terms which you propose.<ref>Gott, p. 257</ref>}}\n\nThe asperity of these notes was only superficial; Buckner greeted his old friend warmly when Grant arrived to accept the surrender. They joked about their time in Mexico and the incompetence of General Pillow.<ref>[http://www.granthomepage.com/intbuckner.htm Hamlin Garland Papers, Doheny Library, University of Southern California]</ref> Grant offered to loan Buckner money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. As mentioned above, Buckner had paid for then-Captain Grant's lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. As evidence of their mutual respect, Buckner later acted as a pall bearer and paid for Grant's funeral in 1885, as well as provided Grant's widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000&nbsp;men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville.<ref>Gott, pp. 262\u201367</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Kentucky===\nWhile Buckner was a Union [[prisoner of war]] at [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in [[Boston]], Kentucky [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Garrett Davis]] unsuccessfully sought to have him tried for treason.<ref name=powell68/> On August 15, 1862, after five months of writing poetry in solitary confinement, Buckner was exchanged for Union Brig. Gen. [[George A. McCall]].<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Eicher, p. 152</ref> The following day he was promoted to [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Major general|major general]]<ref name=stickles192>Stickles, p. 192</ref> and ordered to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to join Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s [[Army of Mississippi]].<ref>Stickles, p. 194; Hewitt, p. 140</ref>\n\nDays after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] began an invasion of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner's home town of [[Battle of Munfordville|Munfordville]]. The small town was important for Union forces to hold if they wanted to maintain communication with Louisville while pressing  southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. [[John T. Wilder]] guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12&nbsp;and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to ask him what he should do. Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder's men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be \"no less than willful murder.\"<ref>Noe, p. 70; Stickles, pp. 194\u2013202; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 229\u201330; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nBragg's men continued northward to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]] where they rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]], the main Union force in the state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where he was able to attend the [[inauguration]] of Confederate Governor [[Richard Hawes]] on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.<ref>McDonough, p. 200; Noe, p. 129</ref>\n\n[[File:Perryville 1545.png|thumb|[[Battle of Perryville]]: Actions in Buckner's sector (~ 3:45&nbsp;p.m.)\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nBased on intelligence acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville in the town of [[Mackville, Kentucky|Mackville]]. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at [[Perryville, Kentucky|Perryville]], but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army\u2014not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's\u2014engaged Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Alexander McCook's]] corps of Buell's army and began the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.<ref>Stickles, pp. 204\u2013208; Noe, pp. 219\u201328, 339; McDonough, pp. 258\u201361; Connelly, ''Army of the Heartland'', pp. 264\u201367</ref>\n\n===Later Civil War service===\nFollowing the Battle of Perryville, Buckner was reassigned to command the District of the Gulf, fortifying the defenses of [[Mobile, Alabama]].<ref name=Eicher/> He remained there until late April 1863, when he was ordered to take command of the Army of East Tennessee.<ref name=stickles213>Stickles, p. 213</ref> He arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on May 11, 1863, and assumed command the following day.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Stickles, p. 216</ref> Shortly thereafter, his department was converted into a district of the Department of Tennessee under Gen. Bragg and was designated the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 140; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 149; Stickles, p. 220</ref>\n\nIn late August, Union Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] approached Buckner's position at Knoxville. Buckner called for reinforcements from Bragg at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], but Bragg was being threatened by forces under Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] and could not spare any of his men. Bragg ordered Buckner to fall back to the [[Hiwassee River]]. From there, Buckner's unit traveled to Bragg's supply base at [[Ringgold, Georgia]], then on to [[Lafayette, Georgia|Lafayette]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]]. Bragg was also forced from Chattanooga and joined Buckner at Chickamauga. On September 19&nbsp;and 20, the Confederate forces attacked and emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Buckner's Corps fought on the Confederate left both days, the second under the \"wing\" command of Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], participating in the great breakthrough of the Union line.<ref>Stickles, pp. 226\u2013231; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 201\u201334; Cozzens, ''This Terrible Sound'', pp. 454\u201362; Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp. 89, 93\u201394</ref>\n\nAfter Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his [[Army of the Cumberland]] retreated to fortified Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, but refused to take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a [[Chattanooga Campaign#Opening the Cracker Line|tenuous supply line]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Six Armies in Tennessee'', pp. 129\u201368</ref> Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner was the author of the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', p. 239</ref> Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Cozzens, ''Shipwreck of Their Hopes'', p. 24; Connelly, ''Autumn of Glory'', pp. 252\u201353; Hewitt, pp. 140\u201341</ref>\n\nBuckner was given a medical leave of absence following Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the [[Knoxville Campaign]], while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]]. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]'s division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, pp. 241\u2013249</ref> The department was a shell of its former self\u2014less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and in no position to mount an offensive.<ref name=stickles250>Stickles, p. 250</ref> Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.<ref>Stickles, p. 252; Hewitt, p. 141</ref>\n\nBuckner had difficulty traveling to the West, and it was early summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], Smith began requesting a promotion for him.<ref>Hewitt, p. 141; Stickles, p. 256</ref> The promotion to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] came on September 20.<ref>Eicher, p. 152; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Smith placed Buckner in charge of the critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through enemy lines.<ref name=stickles262>Stickles, p. 262</ref>\n\nAs news of Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender, on April 9, 1865, reached the department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner his chief of staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the [[Rio Grande]], he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender.<ref>Stickles, p. 265\u2013270; Hewitt, p. 141</ref> Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas.<ref name=winters425>Winters, p. 425</ref>\n\nAt Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Buckner had become the first Confederate general of the war to surrender an army; at New Orleans, he became the last.<ref name=foote>Foote, p. 1021</ref> The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2, (Only Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]] held out longer; he surrendered the last Confederate land forces on June 23, 1865).<ref name=foote/>\n\nConditions set forth in Buckner's surrender were the following:\n\n# \"All acts of hostility on the part of both armies are to cease from this date.\"\n# The officers and men are to be \"paroled until duly exchanged.\"\n# All Confederate property was to be turned over to the Union.\n# All officers and men could return home.\n# \"The surrender of property will not include the side arms or private horses or baggage of officers\" and enlisted men.\n# \"All 'self-disposed persons' who return to 'peaceful pursuits' are assured that may resume their usual avocations . . . \".\"<ref>Winters, p. 226</ref>\n\n==Postbellum life==\nThe terms of Buckner's parole in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], on June 9, 1865, prevented his return to Kentucky for three years. He remained in New Orleans, worked on the staff of the ''Daily Crescent'' newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served on the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867.<ref name=Eicher/><ref name=stickles282>Stickles, p. 282</ref> His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he sent them back to Kentucky in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=stickles281>Stickles, p. 281</ref>\n\nBuckner returned to Kentucky when he was eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville ''Courier''.<ref name=Eicher/> Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the [[United States Congress]] for the restoration of his [[civil rights]] as stipulated by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. He recovered most of his property through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.<ref name=kye136/>\n\nOn January 5, 1874, after five years of suffering with [[tuberculosis]], Buckner's wife died. Now a widower, Buckner continued to live in Louisville until 1877 when he and his daughter Lily returned to the family estate, Glen Lily, in Munfordville. His sister, a recent widow, also returned to the estate in 1877. For six years, these three inhabited and repaired the house and grounds which had been neglected during the war and its aftermath. On June 14, 1883, Lily Buckner married [[Morris B. Belknap]] of Louisville, and the couple made their residence in Louisville. On October 10 of the same year, Buckner's sister died, and he was left alone.<ref>Stickles, pp. 313\u2013322</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1885, Buckner married Delia Claiborne of [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=stickles324>Stickles, p. 324</ref> Buckner was 62; Claiborne was 28.<ref name=stickles323/> Their son, [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], was born on July 18, 1886.<ref name=stickles332>Stickles, p. 332</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nBuckner had a keen interest in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] for president.<ref name=stickles297>Stickles, p. 297</ref> Though Buckner had favored [[George H. Pendleton]], he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.<ref name=stickles298>Stickles, p. 298, 318</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Buckner was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.<ref name=tapp213>Tapp, p. 213</ref> Other prominent candidates included [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Thomas Laurens Jones]], former congressman [[J. Proctor Knott]], and [[List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville mayor]] [[Charles Donald Jacob]].<ref name=tapp213/> Buckner consistently ran third in the first six ballots, but withdrew his name from consideration before the seventh ballot.<ref name=tapp213/><ref name=stickles319>Stickles, p. 319</ref> The delegation from [[Owsley County, Kentucky|Owsley County]] switched their support to Knott, starting a wave of defections that resulted in Jones' withdrawal and Knott's unanimous nomination.<ref name=tapp213/> Knott went on to win the general election and appointed Buckner to the board of trustees for the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the [[University of Kentucky]]) in 1884.<ref>Stickles, pp. 322\u2013323</ref> At that year's state Democratic convention, he served on the committee on credentials.<ref name=stickles323>Stickles, p. 323</ref>\n\n===Governor of Kentucky===\n[[File:Governor Simon B Buckner.jpg|thumb|Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner|alt=A color portrait of an older gentleman with white hair and a white goatee]]\nDelegates to the 1887 state Democratic convention nominated Buckner unanimously for the office of governor. A week later, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] chose [[William O. Bradley]] as their candidate. The [[Prohibition Party]] and the Union Labor Party also nominated candidates for governor. The official results of the election gave Buckner a plurality of 16,797 over Bradley.<ref>Stickles, pp. 336\u2013344</ref>\n\nBuckner proposed a number of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] ideas, most of which were rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', pp. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nMuch of Buckner's time was spent trying to curb violence in the eastern part of the state. Shortly after his inauguration, the [[Rowan County War]] escalated to vigilantism, when residents of the county organized a posse and killed several of the leaders of the feud. Though this essentially ended the feud, the violence had been so bad that Buckner's adjutant general recommended that the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] dissolve Rowan County, though this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1888, a posse from Kentucky entered [[West Virginia]] and killed a leader of the Hatfield clan in the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. This caused a political conflict between Buckner and [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Emanuel Willis Wilson]] of [[West Virginia]], who complained that the raid was illegal. The matter was adjudicated in federal court, and Buckner was cleared of any connection to the raid. Later in Buckner's term, feuds broke out in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher]], [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry]], [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott]], and [[Breathitt County, Kentucky|Breathitt]] counties.<ref>Stickles, pp. 348\u2013355, 367</ref>\n\nA major financial scandal erupted in 1888 when Buckner ordered a routine audit of the state's finances which had been neglected for years.<ref name=kye136/> The audit showed that the state's longtime treasurer, [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]], had been mismanaging and [[embezzlement|embezzling]] the state's money since 1872.<ref name=kye136/> Faced with the prospect that his malfeasance would be discovered, Tate absconded with nearly $250,000 of state funds.<ref name=kye136/> He was never found.<ref name=stickles358>Stickles, p. 358</ref> The General Assembly immediately began [[impeachment]] hearings against Tate, convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and removed him from office.<ref name=stickles358/> State auditor Fayette Hewitt was [[censure]]d for neglecting the duty of his office, but was not implicated in Tate's theft or disappearance.<ref name=stickles355>Stickles, p. 355</ref>\n\nDuring the 1888&nbsp;session, the General Assembly passed 1,571&nbsp;bills, exceeding the total passed by any other session in the state's history. Only about 150&nbsp;of these bills were of a general nature; the rest were special interest bills passed for the private gain of legislators and those in their constituencies. Buckner [[veto]]ed 60&nbsp;of these special interest bills, more than had been vetoed by the previous ten governors combined. Only one of these vetoes was overridden by the legislature. Ignoring Buckner's clear intent to veto special interest bills, the 1890&nbsp;legislature passed 300&nbsp;more special interest bills than had its predecessor. Buckner vetoed 50&nbsp;of these. His reputation for rejecting special interest bills led the Kelley Axe Factory, the largest axe factory in the country at the time, to present him with a ceremonial \"Veto Hatchet\".<ref>Stickles, pp. 360\u2013361, 374\u2013375</ref>\n\nWhen a tax cut passed over Buckner's veto in 1890&nbsp;drained the state treasury, the governor loaned the state enough money to remain solvent until tax revenue came in.<ref name=kye136/> Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention.<ref name=kye136/> In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor's appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.<ref name=harrison121>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 121</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter his term as governor, Buckner returned to Glen Lily.<ref name=kye136/> In 1895, he was one of four candidates nominated for a seat in the U.S. Senate&nbsp;\u2014 the others being the incumbent, [[Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn|J.

[[Gold standard]] Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party\u2014the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or Gold Democrats\u2014which Buckner joined. At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed as a candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party's national convention in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. Former Union general [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]] was chosen as the party's nominee for [[President of the United States|president]].<ref>Stickles, pp. 408\u2013409</ref>\n\nPalmer and Buckner both had developed reputations as independent executives while serving as governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the ''[[Chicago Chronicle]]'', ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', ''[[Richmond Times]]'', and ''[[New Orleans Picayune]]''. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79&nbsp;and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over one percent of the vote in the election.<ref name=beito566>Beito, pp. 563\u2013566</ref>\n\n[[File:Glen-Lily.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A house of wooden construction with a wrap-around front porch and trees in the front yard|Glen Lily, the house where Buckner was born and died]]\nFollowing this defeat, Buckner retired to Glen Lily but remained active in politics. Though he always claimed membership in the Democratic party, he opposed the [[political machine|machine politics]] of [[William Goebel]], his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[J. C. W. Beckham]].

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

They also possess seven supralabial scales (Right).]]\nAdult Western skinks have a broad brown stripe down their backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a conspicuous whitish to beige [[dorsolateral]] stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail.   A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating on the side of head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown.  Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood.  In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail.  They usually have seven [[labial scale|supralabial]] scales and four enlarged nuchals.  Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Geographic range==\nWestern skinks can be found from southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, to the tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and throughout most of Great Basin to extreme Northern [[Arizona]]; central [[Utah]] to the Pacific Coast.  The species is apparently absent from the floor of [[San Joaquin Valley]] (they have been observed in rural areas of southeast Lodi, CA), central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] (except a few scattered locations in the foothills where they are very common), and lowland deserts of [[California]].  In Northern Baja, California the species occurs in the northwestern part at least as far south as Colonia Guerro and in the south in the cape and Comondu regions, Santa Agueda, and San Francisco de la Sierra.  On [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina]], Los Coronados, and [[Todos Santos Island]] off the coast of California.<ref name=Steb2003/>\n\n==Defensive behavior==\nYoung western skinks have a bright blue tail with color that fades with age.  Skinks can perform [[autotomy]]; if seized by a predator its tail is deliberately cast and wriggles violently attracting attention while the lizard may escape.<ref name=Steb2003/>  The tail will grow back with time but is often darker in color and misshapen.  It will play dead, but this behavior is rarely seen. [[File:Juvenile Western Skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus).JPG|thumb|Juvenile western skink|288x288px]]\n\n==Life history==\nThis skink is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] during the period of warm-season activity. During summer most activity is concentrated in the morning and late afternoon.  Where summer temperatures are not extreme, activity extends throughout the day. Adult skinks usually become inactive by early fall but juveniles extend their period of activity several weeks.\n\nThe reproductive season for this species varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions.  Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2\u20136 eggs during June and July.  Western skink females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters deep in loose moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops.<ref name=WTan1957/>\n\nYoung western skinks probably hatch in late summer, and sexual maturity may occur at 2 years of age, but most individuals probably do not reproduce until they are 3 years old. Western skinks can reach an age of up to 10 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Spencer Fullerton Baird|Baird SF]], [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard|Girard CF]] (1852). \"Characteristics of some New Reptiles in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution\".

They also possess seven supralabial scales (Right).]]\nAdult Western skinks have a broad brown stripe down their backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a conspicuous whitish to beige [[dorsolateral]] stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail.   A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating on the side of head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown.
