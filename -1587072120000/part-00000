In justifying Kiss' choice, Simmons commented: \"Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible.

When we did ''Sonic Boom'', it was a big task for us because we were saying, 'How do we define who we are today without losing who we've been?' So, that was a tall order for us, but once we got that under our belts, we wanted to go back in and ''Monster'' is far, far beyond anything we've done in terms of ''Sonic Boom'' and yet it's right up there with some of the best stuff we've done.

You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible.

Shortly thereafter, her mother died. Damon had loved his wife deeply, and in the aftermath of her death his mental health sharply deteriorated. Eventually the king's counsellors pressed him to remarry. Damon agreed, but only on the condition that his bride would be as beautiful as his deceased wife. After searching fruitlessly, Damon began to desire his daughter because of her strong resemblance to her mother.\n[[File:Martyrdom of St Dymphna and St Gerebernus by Jacques de l'Ange (Attr.) or Gerard Seghers (Attr.).jpg|thumb|285|''Martyrdom of St Dymphna and St Gerebernus'' by [[Jacques de l'Ange]]]]\n\nWhen Dymphna learned of her father's intentions she swore to uphold her vows, and fled his court along with her confessor Father Gerebernus, two trusted servants and the king's fool.

It is led by a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] who serves as [[pastor]] of the cathedral, the [[Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Boise, Idaho)|Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].  The diocese is a [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland|Archdiocese of Portland]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Eighteenth and nineteenth century===\nThe first Catholics to arrive in the territory that would eventually become the Diocese of Boise were [[French-Canadian]] [[fur trappers]] in the mid-eighteenth century. That remained the sole Catholic contact in the area until 1815, when 19 [[Iroquois]] migrated into [[Idaho]] from eastern [[Canada]]. These [[Iroquois]] had the rudiments of Catholic belief, and apparently spoke of the need for \"black robes\" to show the way to [[heaven]]. Thereafter, for the next twenty-five years, members of the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] and [[Choctaw|Flathead]] tribes made four journeys to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], attempting to recruit a [[priest]] for their communities. Their efforts bore fruit when, in 1840, Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] missionary, was appointed to minister to them. The first Mass in Idaho was thus celebrated by Fr. De Smet on 22 July 1840 at [[Henry's Lake]].<ref name=\"Fraser\">{{cite web | title=History of the Diocese of Boise | author=Rev Donald Fraser | work=Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise| url=http://www.catholicidaho.org/history.cfm | accessdate=2006-05-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060417121251/http://www.catholicidaho.org/history.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-04-17}}</ref>\n\nFr. De Smet's [[Jesuit]] order constructed the first Catholic church in Idaho, built in 1843 along the [[St. Joe River]] (near the present-day town of [[St. Maries, Idaho|St. Maries]]) under the leadership of Father Nicholas Point, S.J.. The mission was later moved to banks of the [[Coeur d'Alene River]]. The church, named after the [[Sacred Heart]], is most commonly known as the [[Cataldo Mission]]. It is the oldest building in Idaho.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nUntil 1862, Catholicism in Idaho remained limited to the tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in north. However, a [[gold rush]] began in 1862 that brought tens of thousands of people to the [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] basin, including a large number of [[Ireland|Irish]] Catholics. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] created the [[Territory of Idaho]] in 1863, and Pope [[Pius IX]] followed up five years later in 1868 by declaring Idaho an [[apostolic vicariate]]. At that time, both the territory and the vicariate apostolic included the current state of Idaho and the western portions of [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nLouis Aloysius Lootens, a native of [[Belgium]] a priest of the [[Archdiocese of San Francisco]], was named the first [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Idaho, being consecrated as such in the old St. Mary's Cathedral on August 9, 1868 by Archbishop [[Joseph S. Alemany]]. At the time, the population of Idaho consisted of approximately 20,000 people, of whom only 1,500 were Catholic. Shortly after his appointment, Bishop Lootens was called to [[Vatican City|Rome]] to participate in the [[First Vatican Council]]. When he returned to Idaho, he found that the gold rush had ended, leaving only scattered ghost towns in its wake. Lootens submitted his resignation, and moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia]], where he died on January 12, 1898.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nEight years after Lootens' resignation, on 7 October 1887, a new vicar apostolic [[Alphonse Joseph Glorieux]] was appointed by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. Glorieux, a native of [[Belgium]] and an alumnus of the [[American College of the Immaculate Conception]] there, was consecrated bishop by Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] while attending the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|Third Council of Baltimore]] on 19 April 1885 in the Cathedral of the Assumption ([[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]). The bishop made [[Boise]] his see, and established [[St. John the Evangelist]] parish as the [[cathedral]]. On the 25 August 1893, Pope Leo XIII established [[Boise]] as a [[diocese]] and appointed Glorieux as its first [[bishop]].\n\n===Twentieth century===\nThe opening of large tracts of land to settlement and the arrival of the [[railroad]] greatly increased the population of Idaho. When the diocese was officially established in 1893, there were approximately 7,000 Catholics in the state. It grew dramatically over the following century. One group of significance are the [[Basque people]], who began immigrating to Idaho early in the twentieth century and primarily worked within the [[sheep]] industry. (Approximately 15,000 of their descendants remain in the diocese today.)<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nSucceeding Glorieux as bishop in 1918 was Monsignor Daniel Mary Gorman selected by [[Pope Benedict XV]]. Gorman was a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archdiocese of Dubuque]], Iowa. He oversaw large growth within the diocese during his nine years as bishop, adding 32 diocesan priests, completing construction on the cathedral, and doubling enrollment in parish schools.\n\nThe third bishop of Boise was Edward Joseph Kelly, a native of [[The Dalles, Oregon]] and priest of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baker|Diocese of Baker City]]. Kelly was selected by Pope [[Pius XI]]. Consecrated as bishop in 1928, Bishop Kelly served for 28 years until his death in 1956; the state's only Catholic high school bears his name ([[Bishop Kelly High School]]).\n\nOn the death of Kelly, Pope [[Pius XII]] gave the See of Boise to [[James Byrne (Archbishop)|James J. Byrne]], who was transferred to the Archdiocese of Dubuque in 1962.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nThe fifth bishop of Boise, [[Sylvester William Treinen|Sylvester W. Treinen]], a priest of the [[Diocese of Bismarck]], chosen by Pope [[John XXIII]]. Treinen was consecrated on July 25, 1962. He promptly departed for [[Vatican City|Rome]], where he attended three sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. As bishop, he is remembered for implementing the decrees of that council. Treinen retired in 1988 and died in 1996, having served the diocese as a bishop (and bishop emeritus) for 34 years.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>\n\nPope [[John Paul II]] had [[Tod David Brown|Tod Brown]] installed as the sixth bishop of Boise on April 3, 1989. He became the Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange|Orange]] in 1998.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, [[Michael Patrick Driscoll|Michael P. Driscoll]] was appointed bishop by Pope John Paul II.\n\nBeginning in the middle of the twentieth century, large numbers of migrant workers from [[Mexico]] arrived in the diocese. Some settled permanently in the region, while many others remained migratory and would return to [[Mexico]] after the harvest. Toward the latter part of the century, the number of immigrants from [[Mexico]] and other parts of [[Latin America]] increased dramatically, with the vast majority of them settling permanently in the southern part of the diocese. So many immigrants have now made Idaho their home that people of Latin American heritage now constitute well over half of the Catholics within the diocese.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==The diocese today==\nApproximately 150,000 Catholics live within the Diocese of Boise, making them approximately 11% of the population of the state of [[Idaho]]. The diocese is divided up into [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise Regions|six regions]], called [[Deanery|deaneries]]. In the whole of the diocese, there are 51 parishes, 31 stations, and 25 chapels.<ref name=\"Diocese Parish List\">{{cite web | title=Parishes | work=Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise| url=http://www.catholicidaho.org/parishes.cfm | accessdate=2007-04-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412034854/http://www.catholicidaho.org/parishes.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-12}}</ref> There are also five Catholic hospitals\u2014namely Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, [[Mercy Medical Center in Nampa, Idaho|Mercy Medical Center]] in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], St. Mary Hospital in [[Cottonwood, Idaho|Cottonwood]], and St. Benedict Medical Center in [[Jerome, Idaho|Jerome]] \u2014 13 elementary schools, and one high school--[[Bishop Kelly High School|Bishop Kelly]] in [[Boise]].\n\nAs of November 2014, the diocese has two [[Vicar general|vicars general]], Very Reverend Dennis Wassmuth (Vicar General for Finance), and Very Reverend Joseph daSilva (Vicar General for the Clergy and Parishes). The chancellor is Mark Raper, who also serves as the Director of the Diocesan Canonical Office.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Pope Francis appointed [[Peter F. Christensen]] as the eighth bishop of Boise. He was installed on December 17, 2014 at St. John Cathedral in Boise, Idaho.\n\n===Sex abuse===\nIn 1985, Diocese priest Mel Baltazar was sentenced to 7 years in prison after being convicted of molesting children as early as 1966.<ref name=baltazar>http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news3/1985_01_24_Green_JudgeSays_Carmelo_Baltazar_2.htm</ref> The presiding judge also stated that the Catholic Church protected Baltazar while he served in various positions throughout the world as well.<ref name=baltazar />\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Diocese priest Rev.

Some settled permanently in the region, while many others remained migratory and would return to [[Mexico]] after the harvest. Toward the latter part of the century, the number of immigrants from [[Mexico]] and other parts of [[Latin America]] increased dramatically, with the vast majority of them settling permanently in the southern part of the diocese. So many immigrants have now made Idaho their home that people of Latin American heritage now constitute well over half of the Catholics within the diocese.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==The diocese today==\nApproximately 150,000 Catholics live within the Diocese of Boise, making them approximately 11% of the population of the state of [[Idaho]].
