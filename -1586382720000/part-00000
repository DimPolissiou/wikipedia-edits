It offers one degree for all students, the Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. There are no lecture halls. Every class has a maximum of 20 students. The faculty hold terminal degrees in their field, but are known as Tutors rather than Professors. There is no tenure system at Quest.\n\nOther distinguishing features include the Foundation and Concentration Programs, Block Plan scheduling, a Question instead of a conventional major, and a final Keystone project. Dr. Doug Munroe, Social Sciences Faculty, is currently the university's interim Chief Academic Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/about/leadership/office-of-the-president/doug-munroe/|title=Doug Munroe|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation program===\nIn their first two years of study, students enroll in 16 Foundation courses. After completing the mandatory Cornerstone and Rhetoric classes, they go on to take 14 courses chosen from five major divisions: Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Arts & Humanities. They must also fulfil a language requirement.\n\nToward the end of the Foundation Program, students take a course called Question. Working with an instructor and a faculty mentor, they develop a statement of Question: a proposal for how they will study a topic of particular interest to them. The Question is in lieu of a conventional major, serves as the basis for the remaining two years of study, and inspires the student's Keystone project.\n\n===Concentration program===\nThe remaining two years are known as the Concentration Program. With the help of a faculty advisor, students design a personalized program, which consists of four principal elements:\n# a statement of the Question\n# a course plan\n# a list of related readings\n# a Keystone project\n\nAlong with their Concentration (or Focus) Courses, students take between one and four Experiential Learning Blocks, hands-on work that can take place in the private sector, not-for-profit, government or many other settings. Quest states that the purpose of Experiential Learning is to show students how their interests manifest in the world and help them gain direct experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/experiential-learning/|title=Experiential Learning|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Students also take three or more Electives.\n\n===Block plan===\nQuest operates on the Block Plan, where students take one course at a time, meeting every weekday for 3.5 weeks. The academic year is divided into two terms. Fall Term usually runs from September to mid-December, and Spring Term typically runs from January to the end of April. There are four Blocks per term, and full-time students take eight Blocks per year.\n\nQuest claims that the Block Plan allows scheduling flexibility: students can decide which Blocks are spent on courses and which are spent traveling, working, or exploring other pursuits. The school also notes that Block scheduling permits faculty to run Field Studies, off-campus learning experiences that can run for several weeks. Many Field Studies involve fees, which range from nominal to significant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/field-studies/|title=Field Studies|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Quest also offers Study Abroad. Students can spend one or two academic terms at a selection of partner universities around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/study-abroad/|title=Study Abroad|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Keystone===\nTo graduate, students must complete a Keystone project, the culmination of their studies. A Keystone can take various forms: a scientific paper, video documentary, art installation, photography exhibit, work of fiction, or research paper. Students present their Keystones to their peers, faculty and community. A few outstanding Keystones are granted Distinction, and some are chosen as Showcases that the students present to a wide audience in a formal setting. The university provides ample services to prepare students to justify, to Graduate school admissions officers, their Keystone as the equivalent to a major.\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\nQuest University Canada has historically posted at or near the top of Canada's foremost poll of student opinion, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/national-survey-of-student-engagement-a-truer-measure-of-quality/|title=National Survey of Student Engagement: A truer measure of quality \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squamishchief.com/news/local-news/quest-dominates-university-rankings-1.1106812|title=Quest dominates university rankings|first=Meagan|last=Robertson|website=Squamish Chief|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/story-of-a-shattered-life-a-single-childhood-incident-pushed-dawn-crey-into-a-downward-spiral|title=Story of a shattered life: A single childhood incident pushed Dawn Crey into a downward spiral|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|author=Lori Culbert |date=24 November 2001|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nQuest is not included in Macleans University Rankings because its enrollment is below 1000 students, the magazine's cut-off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/university-rankings-2018-methodology/|title=University Rankings 2018: Methodology \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> However, Macleans conducted an interview with then-President David Helfand in 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/qa-with-david-helfand-president-of-quest-university/|title=Q&A with David Helfand, president of Quest University \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> and has published several articles about the school over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/tag/quest-university/|title=Quest University news, opinion and analysis \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Quest has also been noted in The Globe and Mail's University Report.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/university-profiles-to-help-you-choose/article21187051/|title=University profiles to help you choose|accessdate=12 February 2019|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[insolvency]] lawsuit of February 2020, court documents filed by the university in support of the application for creditor protection say that Quest has experienced operating deficits and negative cash flows for several years.<ref name=\"KFraser\">{{cite news\n | last = Fraser\n | first = Keith\n | title = Quest University granted creditor protection in court\n | newspaper = [[The Vancouver Sun]]\n | location = [[Vancouver, BC]]\n | publisher = [[Postmedia]]\n | date = 17 January 2020\n | url = https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/quest-university-granted-creditor-protection-in-court\n | access-date = 8 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Despite financial protection, Quest\u2019s biggest lender sues school |url=https://www.squamishchief.com/news/local-news/despite-financial-protection-quest-s-biggest-lender-sues-school-1.24088623 |website=The Squamish Chief |publisher=The Squamish Chief |accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Quest University granted financial protection |url=https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/updated-quest-university-granted-financial-protection/Content?oid=14925554 |accessdate=6 March 2020 |date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The university is currently up for sale. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Quest University lands up for sale |url=https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/quest-university-lands-up-for-sale/Content?oid=15245813 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nDr. George Iwama is the current president of Quest University Canada.

According to the Traditional Territory Acknowledgment on its website, Quest sits on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the Squamish peoples; the university has successfully maintained a strong relationship with the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh (\"[[Squamish_people|Squamish]]\") Nation.<ref name=\"questu.ca\"/>\n\nQuest's campus includes an academic building, a library building, a \"RecPlex\" which contains a full gymnasium facility, and a services building that includes a cafeteria. There are currently five main student residences, each are priced the same as an average Canadian university and with nearly twice the floor space. All students have access to a kitchen, and nearly 60% of students have access to a private kitchen.\n\n==Cost and financial aid==\nBecause Quest is private, it receives no government funding at any level. Its operations are funded by tuition and private donations. According to its website, full-time tuition for the 2019\u20132020 academic year is [[Canadian dollar|C$]]35,000. Room and board can add another C$15,000, depending on the student's selections.\n\nEligible students can receive financial aid, including scholarships that range from C$2000 to full tuition; bursaries; and a Work-Study program on campus. Quest also offers substantial scholarships through its LEAP program (see below). Quest is an approved post-secondary institution to administer government student loans from all provinces in Canada plus the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon. Quest is also an approved post-secondary institution to administer certain programs out of the U.S.\n\n== Leaders in Elite Athletics and Performance Program (LEAP)==\nQuest's Leaders in Elite Athletics & Performance program (LEAP) is structured to accommodate the needs of elite athletes and performers who wish to pursue a postsecondary education. LEAP students are afforded extra flexibility in housing, billing, and course scheduling. They may take more years to graduate, and are eligible for LEAP scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squamishchief.com/sports/local-sports/squamish-based-athletes-take-a-leap-of-faith-1.23436344|title=Squamish-based athletes take a LEAP of faith|first=Lauren|last=Boothby|website=Squamish Chief|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nNotable LEAP students and alumni include:\n* [[Jack Burke (cyclist)|Jack Burke]] (professional road cyclist for Team H&R Block)\n* [[Samuel Edney]] (luger; Olympian)  \n* [[Darren Gardner]] (snowboarder; Olympian)\n* [[Rosalind Groenewoud|Rosalind Groenwoud]] (freestyle skier; Olympian, Winter X Games Champion)\n* [[Keltie Hansen]] (freestyle skier; Olympian)\n* [[Leah Kirchmann]] (racing cyclist; Olympian)\n* [[Simon Nessman]] (international model)\n* Carmen Durrer (international model)\n\n== Other notable people==\n=== Staff and faculty===\n* [[David Strangway]] (geophysicist; founding president of Quest University Canada; President Emeritus at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[University of British Columbia]])\n* [[David Helfand]] (astrophysicist; former Chair of the Department of Astronomy at [[Columbia University]] and co-director of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory; President Emeritus of Quest University Canada)\n* [[Glen Van Brummelen]] (mathematics scholar; past President of the [[Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics]])\n* Richard Hoshino (mathematics professor; winner of the 2017 Adrien Pouliot Award for Significant and Sustained Contributions to Mathematics Education in Canada; former coach for Canadians competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cms.math.ca/MediaReleases/2017/ap-award2017|title=Richard Hoshino Receives the 2017 Adrien Pouliot Award|website=cms.math.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of universities in British Columbia]]\n*[[Higher education in British Columbia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n* {{Official website|https://questu.ca}}\n\n{{BC Uni|state=expanded|private=yes|college=no}}\n{{Coord|49|44|24.64|N|123|6|29.75|W|display=title|type:edu}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Sea-to-Sky Corridor]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Private universities and colleges in Canada]]\n[[Category:Higher education in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Quest University Canada Aerial View.jpg|thumb|Quest University Canada Academic Building Aerial View]]\n{{COI|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox university\n|name            = Quest University Canada\n|native_name     =\n|image           = Questu logo.png\n|motto           = curiosity required\n|established     = 2007\n|type            = Private, secular, not-for-profit liberal arts university\n|endowment       =\n|staff           =\n|faculty         =\n|chancellor      = Peter Webster\n|president       = George Iwama\n|city            = [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]]\n|state           = [[British Columbia]]\n|country         = Canada\n|campus          = Small town \n|colours         = Green, silver, white\n|nickname        = Quest\n|affiliations    = [[Canadian Bureau for International Education|CBIE]], [[Canadian University Press|CUP]]\n|footnotes       =\n|website         = {{URL|https://questu.ca/}}\n}}\n\n'''Quest University''' (officially '''Quest University Canada''') is a private, not-for-profit,<ref>{{cite |title=About Quest University|url=https://questu.ca/about/|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> secular [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts and sciences university]].

It offers one degree for all students, the Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. There are no lecture halls. Every class has a maximum of 20 students. The faculty hold terminal degrees in their field, but are known as Tutors rather than Professors. There is no tenure system at Quest.\n\nOther distinguishing features include the Foundation and Concentration Programs, Block Plan scheduling, a Question instead of a conventional major, and a final Keystone project. Dr. Doug Munroe, Social Sciences Faculty, is currently the university's interim Chief Academic Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/about/leadership/office-of-the-president/doug-munroe/|title=Doug Munroe|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation program===\nIn their first two years of study, students enroll in 16 Foundation courses. After completing the mandatory Cornerstone and Rhetoric classes, they go on to take 14 courses chosen from five major divisions: Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Arts & Humanities. They must also fulfil a language requirement.\n\nToward the end of the Foundation Program, students take a course called Question. Working with an instructor and a faculty mentor, they develop a statement of Question: a proposal for how they will study a topic of particular interest to them. The Question is in lieu of a conventional major, serves as the basis for the remaining two years of study, and inspires the student's Keystone project.\n\n===Concentration program===\nThe remaining two years are known as the Concentration Program. With the help of a faculty advisor, students design a personalized program, which consists of four principal elements:\n# a statement of the Question\n# a course plan\n# a list of related readings\n# a Keystone project\n\nAlong with their Concentration (or Focus) Courses, students take between one and four Experiential Learning Blocks, hands-on work that can take place in the private sector, not-for-profit, government or many other settings. Quest states that the purpose of Experiential Learning is to show students how their interests manifest in the world and help them gain direct experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/experiential-learning/|title=Experiential Learning|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Students also take three or more Electives.\n\n===Block plan===\nQuest operates on the Block Plan, where students take one course at a time, meeting every weekday for 3.5 weeks. The academic year is divided into two terms. Fall Term usually runs from September to mid-December, and Spring Term typically runs from January to the end of April. There are four Blocks per term, and full-time students take eight Blocks per year.\n\nQuest claims that the Block Plan allows scheduling flexibility: students can decide which Blocks are spent on courses and which are spent traveling, working, or exploring other pursuits. The school also notes that Block scheduling permits faculty to run Field Studies, off-campus learning experiences that can run for several weeks. Many Field Studies involve fees, which range from nominal to significant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/field-studies/|title=Field Studies|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Quest also offers Study Abroad. Students can spend one or two academic terms at a selection of partner universities around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questu.ca/academics/learning-beyond-the-classroom/study-abroad/|title=Study Abroad|website=Questu.ca|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Keystone===\nTo graduate, students must complete a Keystone project, the culmination of their studies. A Keystone can take various forms: a scientific paper, video documentary, art installation, photography exhibit, work of fiction, or research paper. Students present their Keystones to their peers, faculty and community. A few outstanding Keystones are granted Distinction, and some are chosen as Showcases that the students present to a wide audience in a formal setting. The university provides ample services to prepare students to justify, to Graduate school admissions officers, their Keystone as the equivalent to a major.\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\nQuest University Canada has historically posted at or near the top of Canada's foremost poll of student opinion, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/national-survey-of-student-engagement-a-truer-measure-of-quality/|title=National Survey of Student Engagement: A truer measure of quality \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.squamishchief.com/news/local-news/quest-dominates-university-rankings-1.1106812|title=Quest dominates university rankings|first=Meagan|last=Robertson|website=Squamish Chief|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/story-of-a-shattered-life-a-single-childhood-incident-pushed-dawn-crey-into-a-downward-spiral|title=Story of a shattered life: A single childhood incident pushed Dawn Crey into a downward spiral|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|author=Lori Culbert |date=24 November 2001|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nQuest is not included in Macleans University Rankings because its enrollment is below 1000 students, the magazine's cut-off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/university-rankings-2018-methodology/|title=University Rankings 2018: Methodology \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> However, Macleans conducted an interview with then-President David Helfand in 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/qa-with-david-helfand-president-of-quest-university/|title=Q&A with David Helfand, president of Quest University \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> and has published several articles about the school over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/tag/quest-university/|title=Quest University news, opinion and analysis \u2013 Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> Quest has also been noted in The Globe and Mail's University Report.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/university-profiles-to-help-you-choose/article21187051/|title=University profiles to help you choose|accessdate=12 February 2019|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[insolvency]] lawsuit of February 2020, court documents filed by the university in support of the application for creditor protection say that Quest has experienced operating deficits and negative cash flows for several years.<ref name=\"KFraser\">{{cite news\n | last = Fraser\n | first = Keith\n | title = Quest University granted creditor protection in court\n | newspaper = [[The Vancouver Sun]]\n | location = [[Vancouver, BC]]\n | publisher = [[Postmedia]]\n | date = 17 January 2020\n | url = https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/quest-university-granted-creditor-protection-in-court\n | access-date = 8 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Despite financial protection, Quest\u2019s biggest lender sues school |url=https://www.squamishchief.com/news/local-news/despite-financial-protection-quest-s-biggest-lender-sues-school-1.24088623 |website=The Squamish Chief |publisher=The Squamish Chief |accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Quest University granted financial protection |url=https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/updated-quest-university-granted-financial-protection/Content?oid=14925554 |accessdate=6 March 2020 |date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The university is currently up for sale. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Steven |title=Quest University lands up for sale |url=https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/quest-university-lands-up-for-sale/Content?oid=15245813 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=April 04, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nDr. George Iwama is the current president of Quest University Canada.

Its head is partially bare, showing red skin, and it has a dense crest of white plumes on the [[nape]]. This species is the [[monotypic|only member]] of the [[genus]] ''Nipponia''.\n\nThey make their nests at the tops of trees on hills usually overlooking their habitat. Crested ibises usually eat frogs, small fish, and small animals.\n\nAt one time, the crested ibis was widespread in Japan, China, Korea, and Russia. It has now disappeared from most of its former range. The last wild crested ibis in Japan died in October 2003, with the remaining wild population found only in [[Shaanxi]] province of China until reintroduction of captive bred birds back into Japan in 2008. They were previously thought to be extinct in China too, until 1981 when only seven ibises were seen in Shaanxi, China.\n\nExtensive [[captivity (animal)|captive]] breeding programs have been developed by China and Japan to conserve the species. They were put on the State Protection List in China. Also, for the past 23 years, China has bred and protected the species. In 2002, there were a total of 130 colonies in China. Northwest Shaanxi province's research center has a history of 26 crested ibis fledglings including artificial, and natural incubation. On July 31, 2002, five out of seven crested ibis chicks hatched at an incubation center in northwest Shaanxi province. This was one of the latest records and highest record ever recorded of chicks that hatched.<ref name=china/> The parents of the chicks were chosen from 60 ibis pairs raised at that research center.<ref name=Mie2012/>\n[[File:Nipponia nippon 20091230131054.png|thumb|left|Crested ibis near Crested Ibis Conservation Center on Sado Island]]\nDue to ongoing [[habitat loss]], small population size, limited [[range (biology)|range]], winter [[starvation]] and persecution{{clarify|date=April 2018}} in last century brought this [[endangered]] species to the brink of [[extinction]]. The crested ibis has been listed in Appendix I of the conservation treaty [[CITES]].\n\nThe [[London Zoo]] had crested ibises from 1872 until 1873. Outside [[China]] only [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] keep this species.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOn September 25, 2008, the [[Sado, Niigata|Sado]] Japanese Crested Ibis Preservation Center released 10 of the birds as part of its crested ibis restoration program, which aims to introduce 60 ibises into the wild by 2015. This marks the first time the rare bird has returned to the Japanese wild since 1981.<ref name=iht/>\n\nOn April 23, 2012, it was confirmed that three crested ibis chicks had hatched on Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture, the first time chicks had hatched in the wild in Japan in 36 years.<ref name=japantimes/> One of the baby chicks briefly left its nest on 25 May.<ref name=Kyodo/>\n\nOn the Korean peninsula, the bird has not been visible since it was last seen in 1979 near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

Its head is partially bare, showing red skin, and it has a dense crest of white plumes on the [[nape]]. This species is the [[monotypic|only member]] of the [[genus]] ''Nipponia''.\n\nThey make their nests at the tops of trees on hills usually overlooking their habitat. Crested ibises usually eat frogs, small fish, and small animals.\n\nAt one time, the crested ibis was widespread in Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Russia. It has now disappeared from most of its former range. The last wild crested ibis in Japan died in October 2003, with the remaining wild population found only in [[Shaanxi]] province of China until reintroduction of captive bred birds back into Japan in 2008. They were previously thought to be extinct in China too, until 1981 when only seven ibises were seen in Shaanxi, China.\n\nExtensive [[captivity (animal)|captive]] breeding programs have been developed by Japan and China to conserve the species. They were put on the State Protection List in China. Also, for the past 23 years, China has bred and protected the species. In 2002, there were a total of 130 colonies in China. Northwest Shaanxi province's research center has a history of 26 crested ibis fledglings including artificial, and natural incubation. On July 31, 2002, five out of seven crested ibis chicks hatched at an incubation center in northwest Shaanxi province. This was one of the latest records and highest record ever recorded of chicks that hatched.<ref name=china/> The parents of the chicks were chosen from 60 ibis pairs raised at that research center.<ref name=Mie2012/>\n[[File:Nipponia nippon 20091230131054.png|thumb|left|Crested ibis near Crested Ibis Conservation Center on Sado Island]]\nDue to ongoing [[habitat loss]], small population size, limited [[range (biology)|range]], winter [[starvation]] and persecution{{clarify|date=April 2018}} in last century brought this [[endangered]] species to the brink of [[extinction]]. The crested ibis has been listed in Appendix I of the conservation treaty [[CITES]].\n\nThe [[London Zoo]] had crested ibises from 1872 until 1873. Outside [[China]] only [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] keep this species.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOn September 25, 2008, the [[Sado, Niigata|Sado]] Japanese Crested Ibis Preservation Center released 10 of the birds as part of its crested ibis restoration program, which aims to introduce 60 ibises into the wild by 2015. This marks the first time the rare bird has returned to the Japanese wild since 1981.<ref name=iht/>\n\nOn April 23, 2012, it was confirmed that three crested ibis chicks had hatched on Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture, the first time chicks had hatched in the wild in Japan in 36 years.<ref name=japantimes/> One of the baby chicks briefly left its nest on 25 May.<ref name=Kyodo/>\n\nOn the Korean peninsula, the bird has not been visible since it was last seen in 1979 near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korea made efforts to restore the species after former Chinese President Hu Jintao delivered a pair of the birds as a present during a South Korea-China summit in 2008; and president Xi Jinping presented one pair more in 2013.

Fort DeSoto became a small community center, trading post, and way station on the route to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. When settlement by the fort began around 1845, it was alternatively known as Pierceville.\n\nThen encompassing a significantly larger area of west central Florida than it does today, Hernando County was officially established on February 27, 1843, two years prior to Florida's admission into the Union. It was created from portions of Alachua, Hillsborough and Orange Counties and included all of present-day Citrus and Pasco Counties.

However, Benton fell out of favor with the county's residents later in the decade due to his decision to support the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the overall reversal of his stance on slavery, and the county's name reverted in 1850.\n\nIn December 1854, the legislature designated the small port town of [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]] the county seat. Residents living in the eastern section of the county instead desired a more central place for the county government, and by 1855, voters had selected an inland site within five miles (8&nbsp;km) of the center of the county at the town of Melendez. In 1856, the citizens of Hernando County chose to rename the town, their new County Seat, [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]] in honor of [[Preston Brooks|South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks]], who in the same year beat fierce abolitionist [[Charles Sumner|Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner]] with a cane in the Senate chambers, winning the Congressman great renown in the South.\n\nIn 1855, town founder Joseph Hale donated land for a county courthouse in the center of present-day Brooksville. Soon thereafter, the structure was completed.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Hernando County primarily contributed foodstuffs, cotton, and lumber to the Confederacy. Although Union ships imposed a blockade on the port of [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]], runners enjoyed a great deal of success\u2014enough to lead the Union in June 1864 to order some 150\u2013250 troops to destroy Confederate stockpiles in the county. In early July, the expedition marched northward from Anclote River to [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], meeting some resistance from assembled Confederate troops hastily organized to protect the city.

Though the Good Neighbor Trail only exists within Brooksville itself, the ultimate goal is to extend it to the Withlacoohee State Trail.\n\n===Major highways===\n{{See also|List of county roads in Hernando County, Florida}}\n* [[Image:US 19.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|US 19]] (''Commercial Way'') is a major commercial highway running parallel to the Gulf of Mexico on the western edge of the county, and used as a primary connecting route to cities on the west coast of Florida, including [[Hudson, Florida|Hudson]], [[New Port Richey, Florida|New Port Richey]], [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], and [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], as well as [[Homosassa, Florida|Homosassa]] and [[Crystal River, Florida|Crystal River]] to the north.\n* [[Image:US 41.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] (''Broad Street'') runs parallel to US 19 through points in the center of the county, including downtown [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], where it intersects with SR 50 and US 98. It is still a primary connecting route with Tampa. Between Brooksville and [[Garden Grove, Florida|Garden Grove]], US 41 is a six-lane highway, and between Garden Grove and [[Masaryktown, Florida|Masaryktown]] it is a four-lane highway. To the northeast, US 41 runs through part of the [[Withlacoochee State Forest]]. Plans are currently under way to widen US 41 throughout Hernando County.\n* [[Image:US 98.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]] (''Ponce de Leon Boulevard'') runs diagonally across the county from the northwest to the southeast, where it exits into Pasco County, and runs concurrent with SR 50 in the eastern part of the county, intersects I-75 in Ridge Manor West and meets the Suncoast Parkway at the parkway's current end near World Woods Golf Course north of Brooksville.\n* [[Image:US 301.svg|23px]] [[U.S. Route 301 in Florida|US 301]] (''Treiman Boulevard'') is a north-south highway that crosses into the county briefly at its tapered eastern end, running parallel to I-75, and intersecting with SR 50 at [[Ridge Manor, Florida|Ridge Manor]].\n* [[Image:I-75.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] runs north and south across the eastern part of the county, with one exit (Exit 301) at its intersection with US 98/SR 50. Once a major connecting point with Tampa, I-75 has been made obsolete for western residents of the county by the Suncoast Parkway.\n* [[File:Toll Florida 589.svg|20px]] [[Suncoast Parkway]] (''[[State Road 589 (Florida)|SR 589]]'') enters the county in the south slightly to the west of US 41, and ends in the far northern part of the county at US 98. (N.B. the Suncoast Parkway is considered incomplete; there are plans for it to extend through northern Hernando County and through adjacent Citrus County and head into Crystal River.) The Suncoast Parkway is a toll road that connects Hernando County with [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], where it becomes the [[Veterans Expressway]] and heads directly into [[Tampa International Airport]] before reaching [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|Interstate 275]]. SR 589 has four Hernando County exits: [[State Road 578 (Florida)|County Line Road]] (Exit 37), [[Hernando County, Florida Road 574|Spring Hill Drive]] (Exit 41), [[State Road 50 (Florida)|SR 50]] (Exit 46), and [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]] (Future Exit 54).\n* [[Image:Florida 50.svg|20px]] [[State Road 50 (Florida)|SR 50]] (''Cortez Boulevard'') begins at US 19 in [[Weeki Wachee, Florida|Weeki Wachee]], runs through [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], and exits into [[Sumter County, Florida|Sumter County]] at the eastern tip of the county. Along the way, it interchanges with the Suncoast Parkway, intersects with US 41 in Brooksville, runs concurrently with US 98, and intersects with I-75 in Ridge Manor West(Hernando County's only interchange with I-75) and US 301 in [[Ridge Manor, Florida|Ridge Manor]]. A significant, well-developed highway in the county, SR 50 originally extended from US 19 to the Gulf Coast at [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]]. This section was given back to the county and is currently [[Hernando County, Florida Road 550|CR 550]]. Currently, S.R. 50 is used as a beeline route from the county to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in the east.\n* [[Image:Alt plate.svg|20px]]<br />[[Image:Florida 50.svg|20px]] [[State Road 50A (Florida)|SR 50 Alternate]] (''Jefferson Street'') is a spur of SR 50 that runs through downtown Brooksville, running concurrently with both US 41 and US 98 at points.\n* [[Image:Hernando County Road 574 FL.svg|23px]] [[Hernando County, Florida Road 574|Spring Hill Drive]] (''CR 574'') is a major county road running roughly parallel to both SR 50 and the border with Pasco County beginning by US 19, intersects the Suncoast Parkway, and ends at US 41.\n* [[Image:Hernando County Road 578 FL.svg|23px]] [[Florida State Road 578|County Line Road]] (''CR 578'') is a major county road running entirely along the border with Pasco County beginning at US 19, intersects the Suncoast Parkway, and ends at US 41.

Fort DeSoto became a small community center, trading post, and way station on the route to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. When settlement by the fort began around 1845, it was alternatively known as Pierceville.\n\nThen encompassing a significantly larger area of west central Florida than it does today, Hernando County was officially established on February 27, 1843, two years prior to Florida's admission into the Union. It was created from portions of Alachua, Hillsborough and Orange Counties and included all of present-day Citrus and Pasco Counties. Named for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] [[Hernando de Soto]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

However, Benton fell out of favor with the county's residents later in the decade due to his decision to support the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the overall reversal of his stance on slavery, and the county's name reverted in 1850.\n\nIn December 1854, the legislature designated the small port town of [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]] the county seat. Residents living in the eastern section of the county instead desired a more central place for the county government, and by 1855, voters had selected an inland site within five miles (8&nbsp;km) of the center of the county at the town of Melendez. In 1856, the citizens of Hernando County chose to rename the town, their new County Seat, [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]] in honor of [[Preston Brooks|South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks]], who in the same year beat fierce abolitionist [[Charles Sumner|Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner]] with a cane in the Senate chambers, winning the Congressman great renown in the South.\n\nIn 1855, town founder Joseph Hale donated land for a county courthouse in the center of present-day Brooksville. Soon thereafter, the structure was completed.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Hernando County primarily contributed foodstuffs, cotton, and lumber to the Confederacy. Although Union ships imposed a blockade on the port of [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]], runners enjoyed a great deal of success\u2014enough to lead the Union in June 1864 to order some 150\u2013250 troops to destroy Confederate stockpiles in the county. In early July, the expedition marched northward from Anclote River to [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], meeting some resistance from assembled Confederate troops hastily organized to protect the city. The Federal troops won this engagement (known locally as the Brooksville Raid<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pascocemeteries.org/brooksville_bayport_raid.html|first=Jeff|last=Cannon|date=December 11, 2009|title=The Brooksville-Bayport Raid and The Civil War in Hernando County|work=|accessdate=February 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313153213/http://pascocemeteries.org/brooksville_bayport_raid.html|archive-date=March 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and marched to Bayport, where they and an auxiliary force landing from gunboats sacked Rebel operations.
