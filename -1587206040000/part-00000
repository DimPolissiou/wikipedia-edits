The Hafsids were Ifriqiya governors of the [[Almohads]] until 1229, when they declared independence. After the split of the Hafsids from the [[Almohads]] under [[Abu Zakariya]] (1228\u20131249), Abu Zakariya organised the administration in [[Ifriqiya]] (the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa]] in modern [[Maghreb]]; today's [[Tunisia]], eastern [[Algeria]] and western [[Libya]]) and built [[Tunis]] up as the economic and cultural centre of the empire. At the same time, many Muslims from [[Al-Andalus]] fleeing the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spanish]] ''[[Reconquista]]'' of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] were absorbed. He also conquered the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] in 1242 and made the [[Abdalwadid]]s his vassals. His successor [[Muhammad I al-Mustansir]] (1249\u20131277) took the title of ''[[Caliph]]''.\n\nHe extended the boundaries of his State by subjugating the central Maghreb, going so far as to impose his overlordship over the Kingdom of [[Tlemcen]], northern Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Granada]] Spain.

The successor of Ab\u00fb Zakariya' Yahya, Abu ' Abd Allah Muhammad al-Mustansir, proclaimed himself Caliph in 1256 and continued the policies of his father.

The Ottomans again conquered Tunis in 1569 and held it for four years. [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]] recaptured it in 1573. The Ottomans reconquered Tunis in 1574, and [[Muhammad VI of Tunis|Muhammad VI]], the last Caliph of the Hafsids, was brought to [[Constantinople]] and was subsequently executed due to his collaboration with Spain and the desire of the Ottoman Sultan to take the title of [[Caliph]] as he now controlled Mecca and Medina. The Hafsid lineage survived the Ottoman massacre by a branch of the family being taken to the Canary Island of [[Tenerife]] by the Spanish.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n{{see also|Conquest of Tunis (1534)|conquest of Tunis (1535)|Conquest of Tunis (1574)}}\n\n==Hafsid rulers==\n*[[Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid ibn Abi Hafs]] (1207\u20131221)\n*[[Abu Muhammad Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Wahid]] (1226\u20131228)\n*[[Abu Zakariya Yahya]] (1228\u20131249)\n*[[Muhammad I al-Mustansir]] (1249\u20131277)\n*[[Yahya II al-Wathiq]] (1277\u20131279)\n*[[Ibrahim I (Hafsid dynasty)|Ibrahim I]] (1279\u20131283)\n*[[Abd al-Aziz I]] (1283)\n*[[Ibn Abi Umara]] (1283\u20131284)\n*[[Abu Hafs Umar I]] (1284\u20131295)\n*[[Abu Asida Muhammad al-Muntasir|Muhammad I]] (1295\u20131309)\n*[[Abu Yahya Abu Bakr ash-Shahid|Abu Bakr I]] (1309)\n*[[Aba al-Baqa Khalid an-Nasir]] (1309\u20131311)\n*[[Aba Yahya Zakariya al-Lihyani]] (1311\u20131317)\n*[[Abu Darba Muhammad al-Mustansir al-Lihyani|Muhammad II]] (1317\u20131318)\n*[[Abu Bakr II (Banu Haf)|Abu Bakr II]] (1318\u20131346)\n*[[Abu Hafs Umar ben Abi Bakr|Abu Hafs Umar II]] (1346\u20131349)\n*[[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad al-Fadi al-Mutawakkil|Ahmad I]] (1349)\n*[[Ibrahim II (Hafsid)|Ibrahim II]] (1350\u20131369)\n*[[Abu al-Baqa Khalid]] (1369\u20131371)\n*[[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad II|Ahmad II]] (1371\u20131394)\n*[[Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II|Abd al-Aziz II]] (1394\u20131434)\n*[[Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad al-Mutansir|Muhammad III]] (1434\u20131436)\n*[[Abu 'Amr 'Uthman]] (1436\u20131488)\n*[[Abu Zakariya Yahya II]] (1488\u20131489)\n*[[Abd al-Mu'min (Hafsid)]] (1489\u20131490)\n*[[Abu Yahya Zakariya]] (1490\u20131494)\n*[[Muhammad IV (Hafsid)|Muhammad IV]] (1494\u20131526)\n*[[Muhammad V (Hafsid)|Muhammad V]] (1526\u20131543)\n*[[Ahmad III (Hafsid)|Ahmad III]] (1543\u20131569)\n*Ottoman conquest (1569\u20131573)\n*[[Muhammad VI (Hafsid)|Muhammad VI]] (1573\u20131574)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Almohad Caliphate]]\n*[[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n\n{{History of Libya}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{History of Algeria}}\n{{Muslim dynasties in Maghreb region}}\n{{Timeline of the Maghreb dynasties}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hafsid Dynasty}}\n[[Category:1574 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:Hafsid dynasty|*]]\n[[Category:Medieval Algeria]]\n[[Category:Ifriqiya]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1229]]\n[[Category:Tunisian people of Moroccan descent]]\n[[Category:Hintata]]\n", "name_user": "Mdsabeel", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafsid_dynasty"}
