In 2002-2003 the school was ranked top 10 in the PIAA AAA rankings. They were also ranked top 50 nationally. 2 wrestlers in 2010 medaled in states.\n\n'''Pleasant Valley Football''' The Pleasant Valley Football program was a major contender in the [[Mountain Valley Conference (PA)]] (MVC) for quite some time, winning the [[PIAA District 11|District 11]] Championship in 1999 and numerous Conference Championships. Since then they were MVC champions a few more times and continued to be a top competitor in the MVC. The New Football Coach Jim Terwilliger was hired in March 2009. Terwilliger, the former Harlon Hill Trophy winner (Division 2's Heisman Trophy) tried to put the Bears back in the MVC race. The Proudest part of Pleasant Valley Football's history is \"The Old Oaken Bucket\". It is an annual rivalry game between the Pocono Mountain East Cardinals and the PV Bears, which has been played since the 60's.  For 8 years, up until the 07-08 season, the bears have kept the bucket. This is an individual record for the most times in a row either of the teams have had the bucket. Also Pleasant Valley has had the bucket, the trophy given to the team who wins the game each year that really is a bucket with a football trophy topper on it, the most times out of all 40+ years they have been playing this game. Pleasant Valley currently holds \"The Bucket\" after an emotional game that came down to the last play. Pleasant Valley won 24-19. Pleasant Valley leads the series with Pocono Mountain.\n\n===Arts===\n'''Pleasant Valley Marching Band''' The 2010 Pleasant Valley High School Marching Band was crowned the [[USSBA]] Group 4A Pennsylvania State Champions with their show \"Western Portraits.\" The show included songs such as The Magnificent Seven, Silverado, and Hoedown.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.pvbears.org/Domain/57 Pleasant Valley High School Official Website]\n\n{{Eastern Pennsylvania Conference}}\n{{Monroe County, Pennsylvania School Districts}}\n\n[[Category:Public high schools in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1960]]\n[[Category:Schools in Monroe County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1960 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "MathGeek07", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasant_Valley_High_School_(Pennsylvania)"}
