E. Hinton]]. The film was released on March 25, 1983. Jo Ellen Misakian, a librarian at [[Lone Star Elementary School]] in [[Fresno, California]], and her students were responsible for inspiring Coppola to make the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=films&action=show_one&film_id=25 |title=American Zoetrope: Films |publisher=Zoetrope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nThe film is noted for its cast of up-and-coming stars, including [[C. Thomas Howell]] (who garnered a [[Young Artist Award]]), [[Rob Lowe]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Ralph Macchio]], and [[Diane Lane]]. The film helped spark the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] genre of the 1980s. Both Lane and Dillon went on to appear in Coppola's related film ''[[Rumble Fish]]''; Dillon and Estevez also starred in ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'' (1982). Estevez went on to write and star in ''[[That Was Then... This Is Now]]'' (1985), the only Hinton film adaptation not to star Dillon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies - S.E. Hinton|url=http://www.sehinton.com/movies/|ref=2}}</ref>\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, most notably the performances, particularly Macchio being singled out for praise, and performed well at the box office, grossing $33.7 million on a $10.0 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1960s in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] are a gang of tough, low-income working-class teens. They include Ponyboy Curtis and his two older brothers, Sodapop and Darrel, as well as Johnny Cade, Dallas Winston, Keith \"Two-Bit\" Matthews, and Steve Randle. Their rivalry is with the Socs (pronounced \"so-shis\" /\u02c8so\u028a\u0283\u026az/, short for Socials), a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon, and Randy Anderson, confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry and Marcia, at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going home with the Socs. Later that night, when Ponyboy comes home very late, Darrel loses his temper and hits him, causing him to run away. Ponyboy and Johnny take a walk through the park to calm down and are then attacked by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs, all drunk. They begin dunking Ponyboy in a fountain attempting to drown him, but Johnny pulls out his switchblade and fatally stabs Bob. Randy and the Socs run away in fear.\n\nOn the advice of Dallas, and knowing that murder in Oklahoma is punishable by [[capital punishment|death]], Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church in Windrixville. To change their appearances, both boys cut their hair while Ponyboy bleaches his with peroxide. To pass time, the boys play poker and Ponyboy reads [[Gone with the Wind (novel)|''Gone with the Wind'']] and quotes the [[Robert Frost]] poem \"[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (poem)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]\". After a few days, Dallas arrives with news that Cherry has offered to support the boys in court, that he told the police that Johnny and Pony were in Texas, and gives Pony a note from Sodapop, saying that Darrel is sorry and asking them to come home. They go out to get something to eat, then return to find the church on fire with children trapped inside. The Greasers rescue the kids from the burning church, but Johnny and Dallas are injured in the process. Dallas heals quickly, but Johnny ends up with a broken back and severe burns. The boys are praised for their heroism, but Johnny is charged with manslaughter for killing Bob, while Ponyboy may be sent to a boys' home.\n\nBob's death sparked calls from the Socs for \"a rumble\". The greasers meet up with Tim Shepard's gang and arrive at the rumble. The Greasers and Socs exchange a few words, and then Dally runs in and punches one. This triggers the beginning of the fight, which the greasers eventually win. After the rumble, Dallas drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to visit Johnny. The pair gets pulled over by an officer. He asks them about Ponyboy, in which Dally replies, \"the kid fell off his motorcycle.\" The officer then gives them an escort to the hospital. They run into Johnny's hospital room to tell him about the victory, but Johnny is unimpressed and dies after telling Ponyboy to \"stay gold\", referring to the Frost poem. Unable to bear Johnny's death, Dallas wanders through the hospital, pretending to shoot a doctor with his empty gun. He then robs a grocery store, but he is shot and wounded by the owner as he flees. Pursued by the police, Dallas is eventually surrounded in a park and then commits [[suicide by cop]] by pointing his empty gun at the officers, causing them to shoot him dead.\n\nPonyboy is eventually cleared of wrongdoing in Bob's death and allowed to stay with his brothers. Turning the pages of Johnny's copy of ''Gone with the Wind'', Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life. The story ends with Ponyboy writing a school report about his experiences.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[C.

E. Hinton]]. The film was released on March 25, 1983. Jo Ellen Misakian, a librarian at [[Lone Star Elementary School]] in [[Fresno, California]], and her students were responsible for inspiring Coppola to make the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=films&action=show_one&film_id=25 |title=American Zoetrope: Films |publisher=Zoetrope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nThe film is noted for its cast of up-and-coming stars, including [[C. Thomas Howell]] (who garnered a [[Young Artist Award]]), [[Rob Lowe]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Ralph Macchio]], and [[Diane Lane]]. The film helped spark the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] genre of the 1980s. Both Lane and Dillon went on to appear in Coppola's related film ''[[Rumble Fish]]''; Dillon and Estevez also starred in ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'' (1982). Estevez went on to write and star in ''[[That Was Then... This Is Now]]'' (1985), the only Hinton film adaptation not to star Dillon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies - S.E. Hinton|url=http://www.sehinton.com/movies/|ref=2}}</ref>\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, most notably the performances, particularly Macchio being singled out for praise, and performed well at the box office, grossing $33.7 million on a $10.0 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1960s in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] are a gang of tough, low-income working-class teens. They include Ponyboy Curtis and his two older brothers, Sodapop and Darrel, as well as Johnny Cade, Dallas Winston, Keith \"Two-Bit\" Matthews, and Steve Randle. Their rivalry is with the Socs (pronounced \"so-shis\" /\u02c8so\u028a\u0283\u026az/, short for Socials), a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon, and Randy Anderson, confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry and Marcia, at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going home with the Socs. Later that night, when Ponyboy comes home very late, Darrel loses his temper and hits him, causing him to run away. Ponyboy and Johnny take a walk through the park to calm down and are then attacked by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs, all drunk. They begin dunking Ponyboy in a fountain attempting to drown him, but Johnny pulls out his switchblade and fatally stabs Bob. Randy and the Socs run away in fear.\n\nOn the advice of Dallas, and knowing that murder in Oklahoma is punishable by [[capital punishment|death]], Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church in Windrixville. To change their appearances, both boys cut their hair while Ponyboy bleaches his with peroxide. To pass time, the boys play poker and Ponyboy reads [[Gone with the Wind (novel)|''Gone with the Wind'']] and quotes the [[Robert Frost]] poem \"[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (poem)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]\". After a few days, Dallas arrives with news that Cherry has offered to support the boys in court, that he told the police that Johnny and Pony were in Texas, and gives Pony a note from Sodapop, saying that Darrel is sorry and asking them to come home. They go out to get something to eat, then return to find the church on fire with children trapped inside. The Greasers rescue the kids from the burning church, but Johnny and Dallas are injured in the process. Dallas heals quickly, but Johnny ends up with a broken back and severe burns. The boys are praised for their heroism, but Johnny is charged with manslaughter for killing Bob, while Ponyboy may be sent to a boys' home.\n\nBob's death sparked calls from the Socs for \"a rumble\u201d. The greasers meet up with Tim Shepard\u2019s gang and arrive at the rumble. The Greasers and Socs exchange a few words, and then Dally runs in and punches one. This triggers the beginning of the fight, which the greasers eventually win. After the rumble, Dallas drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to visit Johnny. The pair gets pulled over by an officer. He asks them about Ponyboy, in which Dally replies, \u201cThe kid fell off his motorcycle.\u201d The officer then gives them an escort to the hospital. They run into Johnny\u2019s hospital room to tell him about the victory, but Johnny is unimpressed and dies after telling Ponyboy to \"stay gold,\" referring to the Frost poem. Unable to bear Johnny's death, Dallas wanders through the hospital, pretending to shoot a doctor with his empty gun. He then robs a grocery store, but he is shot and wounded by the owner as he flees. Pursued by the police, Dallas is eventually surrounded in a park and then commits [[suicide by cop]] by pointing his empty gun at the officers, causing them to shoot him dead.\n\nPonyboy is eventually cleared of wrongdoing in Bob's death and allowed to stay with his brothers. Turning the pages of Johnny's copy of ''Gone with the Wind'', Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life. The story ends with Ponyboy writing a school report about his experiences.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[C.

Despite setbacks, he is determined to own and manage a bar. With his business partner Merv Ferguson, Kristal convinces his mother to lend them the money needed to establish the [[dive bar]] [[CBGB]], which Kristal intends to make into a [[country music]] venue.\n\nThe business gets off to a rocky start as there are few customers and Kristal has difficulty finding country acts. However, a rock band called [[Television (band)|Television]] arrives at the bar and auditions. Seeing potential, Kristal books them. CBGB soon becomes a rock venue that caters to the burgeoning [[Punk Rock|punk movement]]. New acts such as [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Talking Heads]] and [[The Ramones]] begin to get noticed by playing at the club. The fledgling fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' also gets its start by reporting on the bands and debating the movement's ideology (or lack thereof). Despite CBGB's newfound success, Kristal poorly manages the club's funds (he keeps the money in his apartment freezer) and fails to regularly pay bills or rent. Kristal's daughter, Lisa, attempts to take over the chaotic finances in an attempt to save the business.\n\nAfter The Ramones are signed to Sire Records, Kristal decides to manage CBGB regulars [[The Dead Boys]]. Lisa warns Kristal that he can't financially afford to take on a band. Kristal ignores her, as well as others who caution him about The Dead Boys' destructive and anti-social behavior. While on tour, the band crashes and totals their truck and equipment, leaving Kristal and CBGB broke. This leads to Ferguson threatening to leave the business for good, which Kristal doesn't believe. Soon afterwards, The Dead Boys gets into a fight with a group of thugs and their drummer, Johnny Blitz, is stabbed seventeen times and barely survives.\n\nDespondent and penniless, Kristal announces to his employees that CBGB will be closing. Ferguson and Lisa reveal that they have made many calls to grateful friends whom Kristal helped in the past. They've scraped together enough money to stay open long enough to stabilize the situation. The film ends with [[The Police]] auditioning for Kristal.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that CBGB remained open until 2006. Kristal remains an important figure in the history of punk and [[rock and roll]]. Lisa went on to become a lawyer. Ferguson always wore a yellow construction helmet and no one ever knew why. Kristal continued to manage The Dead Boys until they broke up in 1979. The epilogue closes by stating Kristal's dog, Jonathan, had legendary bowels since he was known for defecating wherever he pleased inside the club.  Over the final credits, the real-life [[Talking Heads]]' acceptance speech during the 2002 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony]] is played, during which they invite Kristal to the stage and thank him for his support.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Hilly Kristal]]\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Lisa Kristal\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as [[Debbie Harry]]\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as Idaho\n* [[Ryan Hurst]] as Mad Mountain\n* [[Stana Katic]] as [[Genya Ravan]]\n* [[Richard de Klerk]] as Taxi\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Cheetah Chrome]]\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as [[Stiv Bators]]\n* Bronson C.

Despite setbacks, he is determined to own and manage a bar. With his business partner Merv Ferguson, Kristal convinces his mother to lend them the money needed to establish the [[dive bar]] [[CBGB]], which Kristal intends to make into a [[country music]] venue.\n\nThe business gets off to a rocky start as there are few customers and Kristal has difficulty finding country acts. However, a rock band called [[Television (band)|Television]] arrives at the bar and auditions. Seeing potential, Kristal books them. CBGB soon becomes a rock venue that caters to the burgeoning [[Punk Rock|punk movement]].

Kristal's daughter, Lisa, attempts to take over the chaotic finances in an attempt to save the business.\n\nAfter The Ramones are signed to Sire Records, Kristal decides to manage CBGB regulars [[The Dead Boys]]. Lisa warns Kristal that he can't financially afford to take on a band. Kristal ignores her, as well as others who caution him about The Dead Boys' destructive and anti-social behavior. While on tour, the band crashes and totals their truck and equipment, leaving Kristal and CBGB broke. This leads to Ferguson threatening to leave the business for good, which Kristal doesn't believe. Soon afterwards, The Dead Boys gets into a fight with a group of thugs and their drummer, Johnny Blitz, is stabbed seventeen times and barely survives.\n\nDespondent and penniless, Kristal announces to his employees that CBGB will be closing. Ferguson and Lisa, however, reveal that they have made many calls to grateful friends whom Kristal helped in the past. They've scraped together enough money to stay open long enough to stabilize the situation. The film ends with [[The Police]] auditioning for Kristal.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that CBGB remained opened until 2006. Kristal remains an important figure in the history of punk and [[rock and roll]]. Lisa went on to become a lawyer. Ferguson always wore a yellow construction helmet and no one ever knew why. Kristal continued to manage The Dead Boys until they broke up in 1979. The epilogue closes by stating Kristal's dog, Jonathan, had legendary bowels since he was known for defecating wherever he pleased inside the club.  Over the final credits, the real-life [[Talking Heads]]' acceptance speech during the 2002 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony]] is played, during which they invite Kristal to the stage and thank him for his support.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Hilly Kristal]]\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Lisa Kristal\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as [[Debbie Harry]]\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as Idaho\n* [[Ryan Hurst]] as Mad Mountain\n* [[Stana Katic]] as [[Genya Ravan]]\n* [[Richard de Klerk]] as Taxi\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Cheetah Chrome]]\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as [[Stiv Bators]]\n* Bronson C.

He made his journey in 18 days. His relation at his return was, that it was about one hundred miles from [[Saco, Maine|Saco]], that after 40 miles travel, he did, for the most part, ascend; and within 12 miles of the top was neither tree nor grass, but low savins [shrubs], which they went upon the top of sometimes, but a continual ascent upon rocks, on a ridge between two valleys filled with snow, out of which came two branches of [[Saco river]], which met at the foot of the hill where was an [[Conway, New Hampshire|Indian town]] of some 200 people. Some of them accompanied him within 8 miles of the top, but durst go no further, telling him that no Indian ever dared to go higher, and that he would die if he went. So they staid there till his return, and his two Indians took courage by his example and went with him. They went divers times through the thick clouds for a good space, and within 4 miles of the top, they had no clouds but very cold. By the way among the rocks, there were two ponds, one a blackish water, and the other reddish [the [[Lakes of the Clouds]]]. The top of all was plain about 60 feet square. On the north side was such a precipice [the [[Great Gulf]]], as they could scarcely discern to the bottom.  They had neither cloud nor wind on the top, and moderate heat. All the country about him seemed a level, except here and there a hill rising above the rest, and far beneath them. He saw to the north, a great water which he judged to be 100 miles broad, but could see no land beyond it.\"  <ref>Dunn et al, pp. 393-394</ref>\n\n\nDarby Field was remarkably accurate in the estimated distances, though the distant bodies of water were likely cloud-banks, and his description of the top of Mount Washington was likewise accurate. Field's feat would be repeated only a handful of times over the next 150 years. \n\n\nThe account of a party of hikers in 1816 shows that they followed Darby Field's notes as a guide and simply saw him as overenthusiastic at the summit; \"The relation of Darby field, may be considered as in the main correct, after making reasonable deductions for the distance, the length of the [[Muscovy glass]], and the quantity of water in view, which it may be suspected has not been seen by any visitor since his time.\"<ref name=\"Darby Field\">{{cite web|url = http://files.usgwarchives.net/nh/coos/history/gazetteers/coosphy1817.txt|title = Gazetteer of the State of New Hampshire 1817|accessdate = 2015-09-06|author = [http://www.usgwarchives.org/ USGW Archives C.
