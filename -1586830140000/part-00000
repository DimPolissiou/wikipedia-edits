As well as this he played in both France and Norway for [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Chamois Niortais]] and [[Str\u00f8msgodset IF]], and was capped by both the [[England under-21 national football team|England U21]] and [[England B national football team|England B]] teams. He also won the [[Football League Cup]] with Nottingham Forest and the league title with Leeds United. He scored a total of more than 250 goals in all competitions during a club career which lasted for nearly 20 years.\n\n==Club career==\nChapman was born in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and began his career at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He made his league debut whilst on loan at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in [[1978\u201379 Stoke City F.C. season|1978\u201379]].<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He made his debut for Stoke in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] with Chapman scoring Stoke's goal in a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He soon became a vital player for Stoke top-scoring in both [[1980\u201381 Stoke City F.C. season|1980\u201381]] and [[1981\u201382 Stoke City F.C. season|1981\u201382]] which prompted [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to pay Stoke \u00a3500,000 for his services.<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/>\n\nHowever, the move was not a success \u2013 he made only 23 appearances for the club and scored four goals.

[[Howard Wilkinson]], then manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], signed Chapman in August 1984, and at Wednesday he regained his goal scoring form; between 1984 and 1988 Chapman scored 63 goals in 149 appearances. However, Wilkinson moved on to manage [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1988, and on his departure Chapman moved on briefly to French side [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Chamois Niortais]].\n\nIn October 1988, [[Brian Clough]] signed Chapman for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref name=sh>{{cite web|title=Lee Chapman|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=36559|website=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> Chapman was an integral part of the Forest team that won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Full Members Cup]] in 1989, scoring two goals in the latter's final.<ref name=sh/> Chapman had a positive season in the league as Forest finished third, though they never looked likely to catch the leading pair of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (champions on goals scored) and runners-up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

As well as this he played in both France and Norway for [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Chamois Niortais]] and [[Str\u00f8msgodset IF]], and was capped by both the [[England under-21 national football team|England U21]] and [[England B national football team|England B]] teams. He also won the [[Football League Cup]] with Nottingham Forest and the league title with Leeds United. He scored a total of more than 250 goals in all competitions during a club career which lasted for nearly 20 years.\n\n==Club career==\nChapman was born in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and began his career at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He made his league debut whilst on loan at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in [[1978\u201379 Stoke City F.C. season|1978\u201379]].<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He made his debut for Stoke in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] with Chapman scoring Stoke's goal in a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> He soon became a vital player for Stoke top-scoring in both [[1980\u201381 Stoke City F.C. season|1980\u201381]] and [[1981\u201382 Stoke City F.C. season|1981\u201382]] which prompted [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to pay Stoke \u00a3500,000 for his services.<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/>\n\nHowever, the move was not a success \u2013 he made only 23 appearances for the club and scored four goals. Chapman moved to [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] in December 1983, but again failed to establish himself in the team, scoring just 3 goals in 15 appearances. [[Howard Wilkinson]], then manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], signed Chapman in August 1984, and at Wednesday he regained his goal scoring form; between 1984 and 1988 Chapman scored 63 goals in 149 appearances. However, Wilkinson moved on to manage [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1988, and on his departure Chapman moved on briefly to French side [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Chamois Niortais]].\n\nIn October 1988, [[Brian Clough]] signed Chapman for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref name=sh>{{cite web|title=Lee Chapman|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=36559|website=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> Chapman was an integral part of the Forest team that won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Full Members Cup]] in 1989, scoring two goals in the latter's final.<ref name=sh/> Chapman had a positive season in the league as Forest finished third, though they never looked likely to catch the leading pair of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (champions on goals scored) and runners-up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

Chapman was part of the Leeds team that won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title and promotion to the First Division in 1990. Leeds finished 4th in 1991, and 21-goal Chapman was one of the highest scorers in the league.

Favorable conditions allowed Irma to [[Rapid intensification|rapidly intensify]] into a [[Category&nbsp;3 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale]] by late on August&nbsp;31. However, the storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories&nbsp;2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of [[eyewall replacement cycle]]s. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by early on the next day. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|914|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}}. Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category&nbsp;5 status before making landfall in [[Cuba]]. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category&nbsp;4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the [[Straits of Florida]], before making landfall on [[Cudjoe Key, Florida|Cudjoe Key]] on September&nbsp;10. Irma then weakened to Category&nbsp;3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on [[Marco Island, Florida|Marco Island]] later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over [[Alabama]] and ultimately dissipated on September&nbsp;13 over [[Missouri]].\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in [[Barbuda]], [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Anguilla]], and the [[Virgin Islands]] as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane. The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in [[Anguilla]]; one in [[Barbados]]; three in [[Barbuda]]; four in the [[British Virgin Islands]]; 10 in [[Cuba]]; 11 in the [[French West Indies]]; one in [[Haiti]]; three in [[Puerto Rico]]; four on the Dutch side of [[Sint Maarten]]; 92 in the [[contiguous United States]], and four in the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on the following day, with winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) near 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of [[Barbuda]] at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at {{convert|914|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} \u2013 this was the lowest in the Atlantic since [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15&nbsp;UTC on [[Sint Maarten]], and at 16:30&nbsp;UTC on [[Virgin Gorda]], in the [[British Virgin Islands]], though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma, Jose and Katia 2017-09-07.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Three simultaneously active hurricanes on September&nbsp;7.

Late on September&nbsp;6, the cyclone passed about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] throughout the day on September&nbsp;7. After beginning an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Irma weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it passed south of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] early on September&nbsp;8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above {{convert|156|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 behind only the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]]. At 05:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, Irma made landfall on the island of [[Little Inagua]] in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a [[ridge (meteorology)|subtropical ridge]] to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of [[Cuba]] as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in [[Cayo Romano|Cayo Romano, Cuba]], at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma & Andrew comparison.jpg|thumb|Combined satellite image of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms]]\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards [[Florida]] around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental [[United States]].

Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall.

As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on the following day, with winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) near 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of [[Barbuda]] at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at {{convert|914|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} \u2013 this was the lowest in the Atlantic since [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15&nbsp;UTC on [[Sint Maarten]], and at 16:30&nbsp;UTC on [[Virgin Gorda]], in the [[British Virgin Islands]], though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma, Jose and Katia 2017-09-07.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Three simultaneously active hurricanes on September&nbsp;7. From left to right: [[Hurricane Katia (2017)|Katia]], Irma, and [[Hurricane Jose (2017)|Jose]], the first occurrence since [[2010 Atlantic hurricane season|2010]].]]\nAs the hurricane moved away from the [[Virgin Islands]] late on September&nbsp;6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls. Late on September&nbsp;6, the cyclone passed about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] throughout the day on September&nbsp;7. After beginning an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Irma weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it passed south of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] early on September&nbsp;8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above {{convert|156|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 behind only the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]]. At 05:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, Irma made landfall on the island of [[Little Inagua]] in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a [[ridge (meteorology)|subtropical ridge]] to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of [[Cuba]] as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in [[Cayo Romano|Cayo Romano, Cuba]], at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\n[[File:Irma & Andrew comparison.jpg|thumb|Combined satellite image of Hurricanes [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms]]\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards [[Florida]] around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental [[United States]]. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye becoming better defined.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} and gale-force winds spanning {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack L.

Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category&nbsp;3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30&nbsp;UTC, in [[Marco Island, Florida]], with sustained winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] as a weakening Category&nbsp;1 hurricane around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation \u2013 though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020,but that has been cancelled because of corona virus!!! It is gettin' real!!!!!!!!!!! as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30.

He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson -=beautiful man and name) described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]],<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> and will be the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In early March 2020, after the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] had caused the closure of theaters in many Asian countries, the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' to be postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed at that time with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was \"the logical choice at this juncture\", feeling the film was \"already in its ideal release date\" and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S.<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise. A Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline, and they speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" /> In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, giving ''The Eternals''{{'}} November 2020 release date to ''Black Widow'' and shifting all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Widow''''' is an upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]],<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> and will be the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In early March 2020, after the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] had caused the closure of theaters in many Asian countries, the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' to be postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed at that time with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was \"the logical choice at this juncture\", feeling the film was \"already in its ideal release date\" and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S.<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise. A Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline, and they speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" /> In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, giving ''The Eternals''{{'}} November 2020 release date to ''Black Widow'' and shifting all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite
