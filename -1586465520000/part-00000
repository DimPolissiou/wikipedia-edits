While the holotype individual was mature, the second skull indicates a less mature individual as indicated by open suture lines that separate skull bones of the braincase (the bones enclosing the brain).<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\n''Sarahsaurus'' was first described by Timothy B. Rowe, [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and [[Robert R. Reisz]] in [[2011 in paleontology|2011]]; the [[type species]] is ''Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis''. The [[Genus#Generic_name|generic name]] honours Sarah Butler and is derived from the greek ''sauros'' meaning \"lizard\". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from ''aurum'' (Latin), \"gold\", and ''fontanalis'' (Latin), \"of the spring\" in reference to Gold Spring, Arizona, where the holotype was found. ''Sarahsaurus'' is the fourth basal sauropodomorph dinosaur to have been identified in [[North America]]; the other three are ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''[[Ammosaurus]]'' from the Early Jurassic of the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and ''[[Seitaad]]'' of the later [[Navajo Sandstone]] of Early Jurassic Utah. It is thought to have appeared through a dispersal event that originated in South America and was separate from those of the other two sauropodomorphs.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/> The animal is notable for possessing very large, powerful hands, possibly suggesting that it was an omnivore.<ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101006-new-dinosaur-north-america-science/</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Skull===\nThe {{Dinogloss|external naris}} (skull opening for the nostril) was less than half the size of the orbit (eye socket). It was bordered by the nasal, premaxilla, and, to a small extent, the maxilla, the latter two forming the upper jaw. Between the premaxilla and maxilla there was a large opening, the subnarial foramen. The antorbital fossa, an additional skull opening seen in most dinosaurs that was situated between the external naris and orbit, was less then half the length of the orbit. Much of the upper margin of the orbit was formed by the {{Dinogloss|frontal bone}} of the {{Dinogloss|skull roof}}; this bone, however, did not contribute to the front margin of the {{Dinogloss|upper temporal fenestra}} at the rear end of the skull roof. Instead, this front margin was formed by the {{Dinogloss|postorbital}} and {{Dinogloss|parietal bones}}, with the front part of the parietal being forked to connect with the latter. Between the parietal and the supraoccipital, which follows behind the parietal at the back of the skull, was another opening, the postparietal fenestra, which was large in ''Sarahsaurus''. A unique feature of the genus can be found on the underside of the braincase, where a shallow ridge spanned between the {{Dinogloss|basipterygoid processes}}, bony downwards projections of the braincase that brace the latter against the {{Dinogloss|palate}}. The lower jaw curved downwards towards its tip, and the jaw joint was located well below the level of the tooth row. There is no evidence for a beak.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\nEach side of the upper jaw was lined with 20 teeth \u2013 four in the premaxilla, the front bone of the upper jaw, and 16 in the maxilla which followed behind. The dentary bone of the lower jaw likewise had 20 teeth. The teeth were moderately [[heterodont]], i.e., tooth shape varied within the jaw, and sat slightly obliquely in the jaw, slightly overlapping each other. Their cutting edges were {{Dinogloss|serrated}} with up to 20 {{Dinogloss|denticles}} per tooth.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\n===Postcranium===\nThe spine comprised 10 cervical (neck) vertebrae; 14 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; three sacral (hip) vertebrae; and ca. 50 caudal (tail) vertebrae. In contrast to the later [[sauropods]], the sides of the dorsal vertebrae did not show deep cavities caused by [[air sacs]] invading the bone ({{Dinogloss|postcranial skeletal pneumaticity}}). The scapula (shoulder blade) was hourglass-shaped. In the holotype specimen, the scapula and [[coracoid]] were unfused, probably connected only via cartilage; this might indicate that the individual was not yet fully mature. The [[clavicle]] was probably connected to the [[sternum]] via a [[synovial joint]]. The left and right clavicles were attached to each other, probably by a [[ligament]], but not fused. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was more than half the length of the [[femur]] (upper thigh bone), and had a large crest on its front side for muscle attachment, the {{Dinogloss|deltopectoral crest}}, which extended for half the length of the bone and had a S-shaped edge. In the hand, the {{Dinogloss|ungual}} (claw bone) of the first finger was the largest.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\nIn the hip, the [[ilium]] had two downwards-facing bony projections, the ischial and pubic peduncle, which connected to the two lower hip bones, the ischium and the pubis, respectively, as in other dinosaurs. In ''Sarahsaurus'',  the ischial peduncle was only half the length of the pubic peduncle. The {{Dinogloss|acetabulum}} (hip joint) was formed by all three hip bones, as in other dinosaurs, though in ''Sarahsaurus'' the ischium contributed less than half as much as the pubis. The pubis was unique in having two separate openings, the {{Dinogloss|obturator foramen}} and the pubic foramen; the latter was lacking in most other [[Archosauria|archosaurs]]. The femur was straight and elliptical in cross-section. The [[tibia]] (shin bone) reached 84% of the length of the femur.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Sarahsaurus braincase.jpg|thumb|Holotype braincase in multiple views]]\nIn a [[cladistic]] analysis, presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, ''Sarahsaurus'' was found to be most closely related to ''[[Ignavusaurus]]'' within [[Massopoda]]. Their group was found to be intermediate between [[plateosauridae|plateosaurids]] and [[massospondylidae|massospondylids]], being more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] than the former and more primitive than the latter.<ref name=Leyesaurus>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=A New Basal Sauropodomorph (Dinosauria: Saurischia) from Quebrada del Barro Formation (Marayes-El Carrizal Basin), Northwestern Argentina |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e26964 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026964 |author=Cecilia Apaldetti, Ricardo N.

While the holotype individual was mature, the second skull indicates a less mature individual as indicated by open suture lines that separate skull bones of the braincase (the bones enclosing the brain).<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\n''Sarahsaurus'' was first described by Timothy B. Rowe, [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and [[Robert R. Reisz]] in [[2011 in paleontology|2011]]; the [[type species]] is ''Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis''. The [[Genus#Generic_name|generic name]] honours Sarah Butler and is derived from the greek ''sauros'' meaning \"lizard\". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from ''aurum'' (Latin), \"gold\", and ''fontanalis'' (Latin), \"of the spring\" in reference to Gold Spring, Arizona, where the holotype was found. ''Sarahsaurus'' is the fourth basal sauropodomorph dinosaur to have been identified in [[North America]]; the other three are ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''[[Ammosaurus]]'' from the Early Jurassic of the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and ''[[Seitaad]]'' of the later [[Navajo Sandstone]] of Early Jurassic Utah. It is thought to have appeared through a dispersal event that originated in South America and was separate from those of the other two sauropodomorphs.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/> The animal is notable for possessing very large, powerful hands, possibly suggesting that it was an omnivore.<ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101006-new-dinosaur-north-america-science/</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Skull===\nThe {{Dinogloss|external naris}} (skull opening for the nostril) was less than half the size of the orbit (eye socket). It was bordered by the nasal, premaxilla, and, to a small extent, the maxilla, the latter two forming the upper jaw. Between the premaxilla and maxilla there was a large opening, the subnarial foramen. The antorbital fossa, an additional skull opening seen in most dinosaurs that was situated between the external naris and orbit, was less then half the length of the orbit. Much of the upper margin of the orbit was formed by the {{Dinogloss|frontal bone}} of the {{Dinogloss|skull roof}}; this bone, however, did not contribute to the front margin of the {{Dinogloss|upper temporal fenestra}} at the rear end of the skull roof. Instead, this front margin was formed by the {{Dinogloss|postorbital}} and {{Dinogloss|parietal bones}}, with the front part of the parietal being forked to connect with the latter. Between the parietal and the supraoccipital, which follows behind the parietal at the back of the skull, was another opening, the postparietal fenestra, which was large in ''Sarahsaurus''. A unique feature of the genus can be found on the underside of the braincase, where a shallow ridge spanned between the {{Dinogloss|basipterygoid processes}}, bony downwards projections of the braincase that brace the latter against the {{Dinogloss|palate}}. The lower jaw curved downwards towards its tip, and the jaw joint was located well below the level of the tooth row. There is no evidence for a beak.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\nEach side of the upper jaw was lined with 20 teeth \u2013 four in the premaxilla, the front bone of the upper jaw, and 16 in the maxilla which followed behind. The dentary bone of the lower jaw likewise had 20 teeth. The teeth were moderately [[heterodont]], i.e., tooth shape varied within the jaw, and sat slightly obliquely in the jaw, slightly overlapping each other. Their cutting edges were {{Dinogloss|serrated}} with up to 20 {{Dinogloss|denticles}} per tooth.\n\n===Postcranium===\nThe spine comprised 10 cervical (neck) vertebrae; 14 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; three sacral (hip) vertebrae; and ca. 50 caudal (tail) vertebrae. In contrast to the later [[sauropods]], the sides of the dorsal vertebrae did not show deep cavities caused by [[air sacs]] invading the bone ({{Dinogloss|postcranial skeletal pneumaticity}}). The scapula (shoulder blade) was hourglass-shaped. In the holotype specimen, the scapula and [[coracoid]] were unfused, probably connected only via cartilage; this might indicate that the individual was not yet fully mature. The [[clavicle]] was probably connected to the [[sternum]] via a [[synovial joint]]. The left and right clavicles were attached to each other, probably by a [[ligament]], but not fused. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was more than half the length of the [[femur]] (upper thigh bone), and had a large crest on its front side for muscle attachment, the {{Dinogloss|deltopectoral crest}}, which extended for half the length of the bone and had a S-shaped edge. In the hand, the {{Dinogloss|ungual}} (claw bone) of the first finger was the largest.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\nIn the hip, the [[ilium]] had two downwards-facing bony projections, the ischial and pubic peduncle, which connected to the two lower hip bones, the ischium and the pubis, respectively, as in other dinosaurs. In ''Sarahsaurus'',  the ischial peduncle was only half the length of the pubic peduncle. The {{Dinogloss|acetabulum}} (hip joint) was formed by all three hip bones, as in other dinosaurs, though in ''Sarahsaurus'' the ischium contributed less than half as much as the pubis. The pubis was unique in having two separate openings, the {{Dinogloss|obturator foramen}} and the pubic foramen; the latter was lacking in most other [[Archosauria|archosaurs]]. The femur was straight and elliptical in cross-section. The [[tibia]] (shin bone) reached 84% of the length of the femur.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Sarahsaurus braincase.jpg|thumb|Holotype braincase in multiple views]]\nIn a [[cladistic]] analysis, presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, ''Sarahsaurus'' was found to be most closely related to ''[[Ignavusaurus]]'' within [[Massopoda]]. Their group was found to be intermediate between [[plateosauridae|plateosaurids]] and [[massospondylidae|massospondylids]], being more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] than the former and more primitive than the latter.<ref name=Leyesaurus>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=A New Basal Sauropodomorph (Dinosauria: Saurischia) from Quebrada del Barro Formation (Marayes-El Carrizal Basin), Northwestern Argentina |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e26964 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026964 |author=Cecilia Apaldetti, Ricardo N.
