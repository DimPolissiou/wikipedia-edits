Before the 12th century, the intellectual life of Western Europe had been largely relegated to [[monastery|monasteries]], which were mostly concerned with performing the [[liturgy]] and prayer; relatively few monasteries could boast true intellectuals. Following the [[Gregorian Reform]]'s emphasis on canon law and the study of the [[sacrament]]s, bishops formed [[cathedral school]]s to train the clergy in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], but also in the more secular aspects of religious administration, including logic and disputation for use in preaching and theological discussion, and accounting to  control finances more effectively. [[Pope Gregory VII]] was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools  that transformed themselves into the first European universities.<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Oestreich |year=1913 |chapter=Pope St. Gregory VII |editor-last=Herbermann |editor-first=Charles |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton }}</ref> \n\nLearning became essential to advancing in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and teachers also gained prestige. Demand quickly outstripped the capacity of cathedral schools, each of which was essentially run by one teacher. In addition, tensions rose between the students of cathedral schools and [[Burgher (title)|burghers]] in smaller towns. As a result, cathedral schools migrated to large cities, like [[Bologna]], [[Rome]] and [[Paris]].\n\nSome scholars such as Syed Farid Alatas have noted some parallels between [[Madrasah]]s and early European [[college]]s and have thus inferred that the first universities in Europe were influenced by the Madrasahs in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=From Jami'ah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian\u2013Muslim Dialogue |first=S.

Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] in ''[[Authentica habita|Authentica Habita]]'' (1158) gave the first privileges to students in Bologna.

In addition, some of the greatest theologians of the [[High Middle Ages]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Robert Grosseteste]], were products of the medieval university.\n\nThe development of the medieval university coincided with the widespread reintroduction of [[Aristotle]] from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab]] scholars. In fact, the European university put Aristotelian and other natural science texts at the center of its curriculum,<ref>Toby Huff, ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. p. 180-181</ref> with the result that the \"medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.\"<ref>Edward Grant, \"Science in the Medieval University\", in James M.

As he puts it \"[[Copernicus]], [[Galileo]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] were all extraordinary products of the apparently Procrustean and allegedly Scholastic universities of Europe...

Classes were taught wherever space was available, such as churches and homes. A university was not a physical space but a collection of individuals banded together as a ''universitas''. Soon, however, universities began to rent, buy or construct buildings specifically for the purposes of teaching.<ref>A. Giesysztor, Part II, Chapter 4, page 136: University Buildings, in A History of the University In Europe, Volume I: Universities in the Middle Ages, W. Ruegg (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1992.</ref>\n\nUniversities were generally structured along three types, depending on who paid the teachers. The first type was in [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], where students hired and paid for the teachers. The second type was in [[University of Paris|Paris]], where teachers were paid by the church. Oxford and Cambridge were predominantly supported by the crown and the state, which helped them survive the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1538 and the subsequent removal of all principal [[Catholic]] institutions in [[England]]. These structural differences created other characteristics. At the Bologna university the students ran everything\u2014a fact that often put teachers under great pressure and disadvantage. In Paris, teachers ran the school; thus Paris became the premiere spot for teachers from all over Europe. Also, in Paris the main subject matter was theology, so control of the qualifications awarded was in the hands of an external authority - the Chancellor of the diocese. In Bologna, where students chose more secular studies, the main subject was law.\n\nIt was also characteristic of teachers and scholars to move around. Universities often competed to secure the best and most popular teachers, leading to the marketisation of teaching. Universities published their list of scholars to entice students to study at their institution. Students of [[Peter Abelard]] followed him to Melun, Corbeil, and Paris,<ref>James M. Kittleson, ''Rebirth, reform and resilience: Universities in transition 1300\u20131700'' (Columbus, Ohio State University Press, 1984), p. 164.</ref> showing that popular teachers brought students with them.\n\n== Students ==\nStudents attended the medieval university at different ages\u2014from 14 if they were attending Oxford or Paris to study the arts, to their 30s if they were studying law in Bologna. During this period of study, students often lived far from home and unsupervised, and as such developed a reputation, both among contemporary commentators and modern historians, for drunken debauchery. Students are frequently criticized in the Middle Ages for neglecting their studies for drinking, gambling and sleeping with prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5022p3bhfmEC&lpg=PA150&dq=medieval+universities+nations&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=false&f=false|title=Medieval Violence: Physical Brutality in Northern France, 1270-1330|first=Hannah|last=Skoda|date=21 February 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515114214/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5022p3bhfmEC&lpg=PA150&dq=medieval+universities+nations&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=false&f=false|archivedate=15 May 2018|isbn=9780199670833}}</ref> In Bologna, some of their laws permitted students to be citizens of the city if they were enrolled at a University.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life in the medieval university|last=Rait|first=Robert S.

In this way no one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an [[ecclesiastical court]], and were thus immune from any [[corporal punishment]]. This gave students free rein in urban environments to break secular laws with impunity, which led to many abuses: theft, rape and murder. Students did not face serious consequences<ref>H.

Sometimes citizens were forbidden to interact with students because they made accusations against the University.\n\nThis led to uneasy tensions with secular authorities\u2014the demarcation between [[town and gown]]. Masters and students would sometimes \"strike\" by leaving a city and not returning for years. This happened at the [[University of Paris strike of 1229]] after a riot left a number of students dead. The University went on strike and they did not return for two years. As students had the legal status of clerics, [[Canon Law]] prohibited women from being admitted into universities.\n\nMost universities in Europe were recognized by the [[Holy See]] as a [[Studium generale|Studium Generale]], testified by a [[papal bull]]. Members of these institutions were encouraged to disseminate their knowledge across Europe, often lecturing at a different [[Studium generale|Studia Generalia]]. Indeed, one of the privileges the papal bull confirmed was the right to confer the ''Ius ubique docendi'', the right to teach everywhere.<ref>Rashdall, o.c.,  Chapter I, page 8.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient higher-learning institutions]]\n* [[Ancient universities of Scotland]]\n* [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation]]\n* [[Nation (university)]]\n* [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]\n* [[Studium Generale]]\n* [[Town and gown]]\n* [[University]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Cobban, Alan B.

Eventually, however, probably in the late 14th century, the term began to appear by itself to exclusively mean a self-regulating community of teachers and scholars recognized and sanctioned by civil or ecclesiastical authority.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: History of Education.

Before the 12th century, the intellectual life of Western Europe had been largely relegated to [[monastery|monasteries]], which were mostly concerned with performing the [[liturgy]] and prayer; relatively few monasteries could boast true intellectuals. Following the [[Gregorian Reform]]'s emphasis on canon law and the study of the [[sacrament]]s, bishops formed [[cathedral school]]s to train the clergy in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], but also in the more secular aspects of religious administration, including logic and disputation for use in preaching and theological discussion, and accounting to  control finances more effectively. [[Pope Gregory VII]] was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools  that transformed themselves into the first European universities.<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Oestreich |year=1913 |chapter=Pope St. Gregory VII |editor-last=Herbermann |editor-first=Charles |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton }}</ref> \n\nLearning became essential to advancing in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and teachers also gained prestige. Demand quickly outstripped the capacity of cathedral schools, each of which was essentially run by one teacher. In addition, tensions rose between the students of cathedral schools and [[Burgher (title)|burghers]] in smaller towns. As a result, cathedral schools migrated to large cities, like [[Bologna]], [[Rome]] and [[Paris]].\n\nSome scholars such as Syed Farid Alatas have noted some parallels between [[Madrasah]]s and early European [[college]]s and have thus inferred that the first universities in Europe were influenced by the Madrasahs in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=From Jami'ah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian\u2013Muslim Dialogue |first=S.

Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] in ''[[Authentica habita|Authentica Habita]]'' (1158) gave the first privileges to students in Bologna.

In addition, some of the greatest theologians of the [[High Middle Ages]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Robert Grosseteste]], were products of the medieval university.\n\nThe development of the medieval university coincided with the widespread reintroduction of [[Aristotle]] from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab]] scholars. In fact, the European university put Aristotelian and other natural science texts at the center of its curriculum,<ref>Toby Huff, ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. p. 180-181</ref> with the result that the \"medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.\"<ref>Edward Grant, \"Science in the Medieval University\", in James M.

As he puts it \"[[Copernicus]], [[Galileo]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] were all extraordinary products of the apparently Procrustean and allegedly Scholastic universities of Europe...

Classes were taught wherever space was available, such as churches and homes. A university was not a physical space but a collection of individuals banded together as a ''universitas''. Soon, however, universities began to rent, buy or construct buildings specifically for the purposes of teaching.<ref>A. Giesysztor, Part II, Chapter 4, page 136: University Buildings, in A History of the University In Europe, Volume I: Universities in the Middle Ages, W. Ruegg (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1992.</ref>\n\nUniversities were generally structured along three types, depending on who paid the teachers. The first type was in [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], where students hired and paid for the teachers. The second type was in [[University of Paris|Paris]], where teachers were paid by the church. Oxford and Cambridge were predominantly supported by the crown and the state, which helped them survive the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1538 and the subsequent removal of all principal [[Catholic]] institutions in [[England]]. These structural differences created other characteristics. At the Bologna university the students ran everything\u2014a fact that often put teachers under great pressure and disadvantage. In Paris, teachers ran the school; thus Paris became the premiere spot for teachers from all over Europe. Also, in Paris the main subject matter was theology, so control of the qualifications awarded was in the hands of an external authority - the Chancellor of the diocese. In Bologna, where students chose more secular studies, the main subject was law.\n\nIt was also characteristic of teachers and scholars to move around. Universities often competed to secure the best and most popular teachers, leading to the marketisation of teaching. Universities published their list of scholars to entice students to study at their institution. Students of [[Peter Abelard]] followed him to Melun, Corbeil, and Paris,<ref>James M. Kittleson, ''Rebirth, reform and resilience: Universities in transition 1300\u20131700'' (Columbus, Ohio State University Press, 1984), p. 164.</ref> showing that popular teachers brought students with them.\n\n== Students ==\nStudents attended the medieval university at different ages\u2014from 14 if they were attending Oxford or Paris to study the arts, to their 30s if they were studying law in Bologna. During this period of study, students often lived far from home and unsupervised, and as such developed a reputation, both among contemporary commentators and modern historians, for drunken debauchery. Students are frequently criticized in the Middle Ages for neglecting their studies for drinking, gambling and sleeping with prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5022p3bhfmEC&lpg=PA150&dq=medieval+universities+nations&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=false&f=false|title=Medieval Violence: Physical Brutality in Northern France, 1270-1330|first=Hannah|last=Skoda|date=21 February 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515114214/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5022p3bhfmEC&lpg=PA150&dq=medieval+universities+nations&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=false&f=false|archivedate=15 May 2018|isbn=9780199670833}}</ref> In Bologna, some of their laws permitted students to be citizens of the city if they were enrolled at a University.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life in the medieval university|last=Rait|first=Robert S.

Originally, only few universities had a faculty of theology, because the popes wanted to control the theological studies. Until the mid-14th century, theology could be studied only at universities in Paris, Oxford, Cambridge and Rome. First the establishment of the [[Charles University|University of Prague]] (1347) ended their monopoly and afterwards also other universities got the right to establish theological faculties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=R\u00fcegg |first1=Walter |last2=Briggs |first2=Asa |title=Geschichte der Universit\u00e4t in Europa 1: Mittelalter |date=1993 |publisher=Beck |location=M\u00fcnchen |isbn=3-406-36952-9 |page=63 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nA popular textbook for theological study was called the ''[[Sentences]]'' (''Quattuor libri sententiarum'') of [[Peter Lombard]]; theology students as well as masters were required to lecture or to write extensive commentaries on this text as part of their curriculum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tkachenko|first=Rostislav|date=2017-06-16|title=Peter Lombard on God's Knowledge: Sententiae, Book I, Distinctions 35-38, as the Basis for Later Theological Discussions.|journal=Sententiae|volume=36|issue=1|pages=17\u201331|doi=10.22240/sent36.01.017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uhzV368KRDMC&lpg=PA52&dq=discussion%20(or%20'disputation')%20of%20the%20Sentences%20was%20an%20integral%20part%20of%20the%20medieval%20theological%20University%20curriculum&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=discussion%20(or%20'disputation')%20of%20the%20Sentences%20was%20an%20integral%20part%20of%20the%20medieval%20theological%20University%20curriculum&f=false|title=The University in Medieval Life, 1179-1499|last=Janin|first=Hunt|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5201-9|location=|pages=52|language=en}}</ref>  Studies in the higher faculties could take up to twelve years for a master's degree or doctorate (initially the two were synonymous), though again a bachelor's and a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]]'s degree could be awarded along the way.<ref>O. Pedersen, ''The First Universities: Studium Generale and the Origins of University Education in Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nCourses were offered according to books, not by subject or theme. For example, a course might be on a book by [[Aristotle]], or a book from the [[Bible]]. Courses were not elective: the course offerings were set, and everyone had to take the same courses. There were, however, occasional choices as to which teacher to use.<ref>Pedersen, o.c., Chapter 10: \"Curricula and intellectual trends\".</ref>\n\nStudents often entered the university at fourteen to fifteen years of age, though many were older.<ref>H. Rashdall, o.c., Volume 3, page 352.</ref> Classes usually started at 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.\n\n=== Legal status ===\n{{Further|Tenure (academic)}}\n\nStudents were afforded the legal protection of the clergy. In this way no one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an [[ecclesiastical court]], and were thus immune from any [[corporal punishment]]. This gave students free rein in urban environments to break secular laws with impunity, which led to many abuses: theft, rape and murder. Students did not face serious consequences<ref>H. Rashdall, o.c., Volume 3, page 360.</ref> from the law. Students were also known to engage in [[drunkenness]]. Sometimes citizens were forbidden to interact with students because they made accusations against the University.\n\nThis led to uneasy tensions with secular authorities\u2014the demarcation between [[town and gown]]. Masters and students would sometimes \"strike\" by leaving a city and not returning for years. This happened at the [[University of Paris strike of 1229]] after a riot left a number of students dead. The University went on strike and they did not return for two years. As students had the legal status of clerics, [[Canon Law]] prohibited women from being admitted into universities.\n\nMost universities in Europe were recognized by the [[Holy See]] as a [[Studium generale|Studium Generale]], testified by a [[papal bull]]. Members of these institutions were encouraged to disseminate their knowledge across Europe, often lecturing at a different [[Studium generale|Studia Generalia]]. Indeed, one of the privileges the papal bull confirmed was the right to confer the ''Ius ubique docendi'', the right to teach everywhere.<ref>Rashdall, o.c.,  Chapter I, page 8.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient higher-learning institutions]]\n* [[Ancient universities of Scotland]]\n* [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation]]\n* [[Nation (university)]]\n* [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]\n* [[Studium Generale]]\n* [[Town and gown]]\n* [[University]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Cobban, Alan B.
