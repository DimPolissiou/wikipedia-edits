Stefano returns in 1984 with his nephew, [[Andr\u00e9 DiMera|Andr\u00e9]], who has gotten plastic surgery to look like Tony. Together they plan to frame Roman for a string of murders; meanwhile Stefano discovers another daughter, [[Megan Hathaway]].

In an attempt to avoid capture, Stefano speeds away as John shoots out his tires and Stefano's car explodes.

Ryan was initially believed to be John Black, but it was later revealed that Ryan died in childhood. Stefano had once again erased John's memory in an attempt to turn him to the Pawn again. In 2009 Stefano EJ's then wife [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]) hide the fact that she switched another baby with Sami's at birth. EJ is furious when he learns the truth and he kidnaps his daughter, [[Sydney DiMera|Sydney]] and fakes her death, leaving everyone devastated, including Stefano.

Meanwhile, Kate has an affair with Ian McAllister ([[Ian Buchanan]]), a past lover, and Stefano files for divorce, taking everything from her. Stefano also turns John and Hope back into the Pawn and Princess Gina after revealing they are married; he forces them to retrieve a precious coin from Alamainia for him. Several other schemes continue to backfire on Stefano, including his attempt to sabotage EJ's mayoral campaign and him blackmailing [[Will Horton]] ([[Chandler Massey]]). Having angered many of his enemies, Stefano is shot and presumably killed in early June 2012. Suspicion for the murder quickly falls upon EJ, who continuously professes his innocence, but no one, save for Will or Sami, seems to believe him. After a series of explosions rock Salem in early August 2012, EJ flees with Sami in tow, and is subsequently abducted by Ian, who professes that he framed EJ for Stefano's murder. Ian then pulls back a curtain, revealing a very much alive Stefano, who is unconscious, bound in a chair and wearing a mask. Ian also confesses to falsifying Alice's letter, as well as the blood test that stated EJ wasn't Stefano's son. Stefano suddenly resurfaces in Europe where he reunites with Kristen and convinces her to come home and bring the family back together. Following the deaths of EJ and Kristen, Stefano forges a strong bond with Chad ([[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]). He encourages him to pursue [[Abigail Deveraux]] ([[Kate Mansi]]) with a secret agenda to obtain Abigail's inheritance but Chad foils his plans. In 2015, Stefano suffers a stroke and is left in a wheelchair which leads to Andr\u00e9's return and the reveal that they are father and son. Stefano advises Andr\u00e9 as he takes over running the family's daily operations. In January 2016, a grief-stricken Hope kills Stefano believing he is responsible for Bo's recent death. Rafe helps Hope cover it up by hiding Stefano's body in an abandoned building and framing Andr\u00e9. Stefano's spirit lingers as he appears to Chad and they say their goodbyes. Stefano last appears to Chad in July 2016 when they were talking about him trusting Andr\u00e9. In February 2017, it appears that Stefano has been captured in [[Prague]] having supposedly faked his death at the hands of Hope. However, it is later revealed that Steve Johnson and [[Shane Donovan]] ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) have orchestrated Stefano's appearance to exonerate Hope of his murder, with Shane posing as Stefano using a bodysuit and makeup. Later as Steve and Shane reminisce about the success of their plan they review some pictures the ISA took from afar of Shane pretending to be Stefano. Yet the setting of one of the pictures is a place Shane never recalls posing at. This leads the men to wonder if the man in the photograph could actually be Stefano, leaving the two men wondering fearfully if Stefano is really alive and is out there somewhere. \n\nIn 2019, \"Stefano\" ([[Stephen Nichols]]) returned to Salem, with the assistance of \"Princess Gina\" and Dr. Rolf.  Rolf explains that Stefano is in fact dead, the victim of Hope Brady's bullet.  However, before he died, Rolf transferred Stefano's \"essence\" - his memories, beliefs, and personality traits - into a computer chip which he has since implanted in Steve Johnson's neck, effectively turning Steve into \"the new Stefano\" (much as he also did with \"Gina's essence\" and Hope).  Rolf did this to get revenge on the enemies of \"the great Stefano\" and return Salem to his reign of terror.\n\n==Henchmen==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

It was later revealed a fake heart attack, and dates is mentioned as March 8. \n* In 1984, his car plunged into the icy waters of Salem's harbor during a police chase.\n* In 1985, Marlena shot him, and he fell from a catwalk as the building caught fire. (he also had a brain tumor)\n* In 1991, he was presumed to have died in another fire and cave collapse.\n* In 1994, his car erupted into a fireball after being shot at by John.\n* Also in 1994, he drowned near Maison Blanche.\n* In 1996, he died in a plane explosion.\n* Also in 1996, he was blown up and buried under collapsing tunnel during a confrontation with Rachel Blake. This was his last depicted \"death\" until 2007.\n* In 2002, Andr\u00e9 DiMera (posing as Tony) claimed that his uncle had died from injuries sustained from a car crash in [[Monte Carlo]].\n* In 2004, when Marlena and the presumed-dead Salem Stalker victims found a blackened, unrecognizable corpse on Melaswen, Andr\u00e9 (posing as Tony) claimed it was Stefano. Andr\u00e9 said he had killed Stefano by draining his blood so Andr\u00e9 could cure his own blood disease.\n* In 2007, his death was faked once again. As a setup by the Salem P.D., Steven \"Patch\" Johnson appeared to stab Stefano to death, but he was drugged and a fake funeral was set up to lure Andr\u00e9.\n* In 2012, Stefano DiMera was shot dead from behind after several characters confronted him about his crimes. On August 16, Ian McAllister claimed to have killed Stefano and on August 20, Ian admitted to EJ that he killed Stefano and planned to frame EJ for the murder. On August 21, it was revealed that Stefano was not killed. Ian used an impostor that looked like him named Paolo. He faked the letter that said EJ was not Stefano's son and faked their blood types in the hospital.\n* In 2016, Stefano was shot three times by Hope because of his alleged involvement in Bo's death. This is the last time Stefano was alive, but the story ends on an ambiguous note as to whether or not Stefano is still alive.\n\n==Notable possessions==\n\n* '''Phoenix Ring''': Stefano's most iconic possession. A gold ring with a black flat square on top. It is embroidered with a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], and said to be the reason why Stefano keeps coming back to life. During the 2009 DiMera-Kiriakis war, Stefano's son EJ wore the ring while Stefano was held captive. It can apparently bring Andre back to life as well, since he is the son of the Phoenix. This was briefly contradicted in 2007 when Andre was revealed to be posing as Tony (who was assumed to be Stefano's son), and therefore was Stefano's nephew, This corrected in 2015 when Andre was revealed to be Stefano's son. After Stefano's final death in 2016 his son Andre wore the ring until his death in 2018, Stefano's youngest son Chad currently wears the ring.  \n* '''Portrait''': Stefano's portrait has been hanging on the wall of the foyer of the DiMera mansion since 2007. The portrait is iconic and synonymous with Stefano's ownership of the mansion. Whenever he has lost possession of the mansion, the portrait is usually taken down. A safe is known to be hidden behind the portrait that contains valuable items to the DiMeras.\n* '''The key \"to ending the feud\"''': A gold key that Stefano kept around his neck. It was said to contain the secret to ending the Brady-DiMera feud.\n* '''Chess set''': Stefano had a passion for playing chess, and kept a chessboard. Whenever Stefano felt he had the upper hand, he would mirror his moves with chess pieces. Stefano would often refer to the people he would use as \"pawns\", and for the longest time the \"Queen\" symbolized [[Marlena Evans]], but Stefano would also use the \"Queen\" to symbolize any women that were important to his enemies. Stefano taught his sons Andre, EJ, and Chad and his grandson Theo to play chess and enjoyed playing chess with them. In 2016, when Hope shot Stefano, his hand symbolically knocked over all of the chess pieces as he fell back into his wheelchair. In 2017 it has been hinted that Stefano might be alive and that he manipulated all of Salem, the ISA and the Salem Police for over a year.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of soap opera villains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/stefano.php Stefano at soapcentral.com]\n* [http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/features/dimera/stefano.shtml Stefano at NBC.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of our Lives characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dimera, Stefano}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Days of Our Lives\n| name = Stefano DiMera\n| image = The bradydimera feud stefano dimera 160x230.jpg\n| caption = Joseph Mascolo as Stefano DiMera\n| portrayer = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] (1982\u20131988, 1993\u20132016)\n* Frank Fata (1991)\n* Davide Shiavone (2007)\n* [[Stephen Nichols]] (2019\u2013present)\n}}\n| creator = [[Pat Falken Smith]]\n| introducer = [[Betty Corday]]<br />[[Al Rabin]]\n| years          = {{Flat list |\n* 1982\u20131985\n* 1988\n* 1991\n* 1993\u20132001\n* 2006\u20132016\n* 2019\u2013present\n}}\n| first = January 18, 1982<ref name=\"SuperiorJoe\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.superiorpics.com/joe_mascolo/|title=The Joe Mascolo Picture Pages|publisher=SuperiorPics.com|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}</ref>\n| last = \n| classification = [[List of Days of Our Lives cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| alias = [[Phoenix (mythology)|The Phoenix]]<br />Rudolpho Meradi<br />Serge Anatol<br />Mrs. Lafferty<br />Joseph M.

Following his initial ousting, fans took to his website to express how much they missed the character.

In 1983, Stefano is sent to prison thanks to Detective [[Roman Brady]] ([[Wayne Northrop]]). Before his death, Stefano's wife, [[Daphne DiMera|Daphne]] ([[Madlyn Rhue]]), reveals that Tony isn't his biological son. Stefano returns in 1984 with his nephew, [[Andr\u00e9 DiMera|Andr\u00e9]], who has gotten plastic surgery to look like Tony. Together they plan to frame Roman for a string of murders; meanwhile Stefano discovers another daughter, [[Megan Hathaway]].

In November 1984, in his quest to obtain one of the prisms, Stefano apparently kills Roman after pushing him off a cliff.<ref name=\"Soap.comBIO\"/> In February 1985, [[Bo Brady]]'s ([[Peter Reckell]]) wife [[Hope Williams|Hope]] ([[Kristian Alfonso]]) is framed for Megan's murder and Stefano vows revenge on the entire family.

He traps several of Salem's citizens on his island but his plans for revenge are foiled and he escapes.

Stefano returns to Salem in 1993 and he is taken hostage by [[Curtis Reed (Days of our Lives)|Curtis Reed]] ([[Nick Benedict]]) in his weakened state; Curtis's attempt to extort money from Stefano's adopted daughter, [[Kristen DiMera]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]), is foiled after Stefano kills him.<ref name=\"SCPro\"/> He then convinces Tony and Kristen to marry but the marriage is ruined when Stefano is revealed as the murderer. In an attempt to avoid capture, Stefano speeds away as John shoots out his tires and Stefano's car explodes. Stefano retreats to his [[New Orleans]] estate, ''Maison Blanche'' where he kidnaps Marlena and John. After the mansion burns down, Stefano buys a penthouse in Salem, next door to Marlena.<ref name=\"Soap.comBIO\"/> Stefano sneaks into her apartment every night and opens her soul, which leads to Marlena becoming possessed by a demon. Under possession, Marlena pushes Stefano out of a window; after the demon is exorcised, a guilt-ridden Marlena helps Stefano recover. In December 1995, Tony fakes his death and frames John.<ref name=\"Soap.comBIO\"/> Stefano is later struck by lightning and becomes so obsessed with Marlena that he bribes the judge presiding over John's murder trial to issue the death penalty. In August 1996 Stefano's plans to frame John are soon revealed and he skips town with Marlena to Paris, where he is shot by his former lover Rachel Blake. Later, his longtime confidante, [[Celeste Perrault]] ([[Tanya Boyd]]) reveals that he fathered her daughter, [[Lexie Carver|Dr. Lexie Carver]] ([[Ren\u00e9e Jones]]) the wife of Salem's police commissioner.

Meanwhile, Kate has an affair with Ian McAllister ([[Ian Buchanan]]), a past lover, and Stefano files for divorce, taking everything from her. Stefano also turns John and Hope back into the Pawn and Princess Gina after revealing they are married; he forces them to retrieve a precious coin from Alamainia for him. Several other schemes continue to backfire on Stefano, including his attempt to sabotage EJ's mayoral campaign and him blackmailing [[Will Horton]] ([[Chandler Massey]]). Having angered many of his enemies, Stefano is shot and presumably killed in early June 2012. Suspicion for the murder quickly falls upon EJ, who continuously professes his innocence, but no one, save for Will or Sami, seems to believe him. After a series of explosions rock Salem in early August 2012, EJ flees with Sami in tow, and is subsequently abducted by Ian, who professes that he framed EJ for Stefano's murder. Ian then pulls back a curtain, revealing a very much alive Stefano, who is unconscious, bound in a chair and wearing a mask. Ian also confesses to falsifying Alice's letter, as well as the blood test that stated EJ wasn't Stefano's son. Stefano suddenly resurfaces in Europe where he reunites with Kristen and convinces her to come home and bring the family back together. Following the deaths of EJ and Kristen, Stefano forges a strong bond with Chad ([[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]). He encourages him to pursue [[Abigail Deveraux]] ([[Kate Mansi]]) with a secret agenda to obtain Abigail's inheritance but Chad foils his plans. In 2015, Stefano suffers a stroke and is left in a wheelchair which leads to Andr\u00e9's return and the reveal that they are father and son. Stefano advises Andr\u00e9 as he takes over running the family's daily operations. In January 2016, a grief-stricken Hope kills Stefano believing he is responsible for Bo's recent death. Rafe helps Hope cover it up by hiding Stefano's body in an abandoned building and framing Andr\u00e9. Stefano's spirit lingers as he appears to Chad and they say their goodbyes. Stefano last appears to Chad in July 2016 when they were talking about him trusting Andr\u00e9. In February 2017, it appears that Stefano has been captured in [[Prague]] having supposedly faked his death at the hands of Hope. However, it is later revealed that Steve Johnson and [[Shane Donovan]] ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) have orchestrated Stefano's appearance to exonerate Hope of his murder, with Shane posing as Stefano using a bodysuit and makeup. Later as Steve and Shane reminisce about the success of their plan they review some pictures the ISA took from afar of Shane pretending to be Stefano. Yet the setting of one of the pictures is a place Shane never recalls posing at. This leads the men to wonder if the man in the photograph could actually be Stefano, leaving the two men wondering fearfully if Stefano is really alive and is out there somewhere. \n\nIn 2019, \"Stefano\" ([[Stephen Nichols]]) returned to Salem, with the assistance of \"Princess Gina\" and Dr. Rolf.  Rolf explains that Stefano is in fact dead, the victim of Hope Brady's bullet.  However, before he died, Rolf transferred Stefano's \"essence\" - his memories, beliefs, and personality traits - into a computer chip which he has since implanted in Steve Johnson's neck, effectively turning Steve into \"the new Stefano\" (much as he also did with \"Gina's essence\" and Hope).

It was later revealed a fake heart attack, and dates is mentioned as March 8. \n* In 1984, his car plunged into the icy waters of Salem's harbor during a police chase.\n* In 1985, Marlena shot him, and he fell from a catwalk as the building caught fire. (he also had a brain tumor)\n* In 1991, he was presumed to have died in another fire and cave collapse.\n* In 1994, his car erupted into a fireball after being shot at by John.\n* Also in 1994, he drowned near Maison Blanche.\n* In 1996, he died in a plane explosion.\n* Also in 1996, he was blown up and buried under collapsing tunnel during a confrontation with Rachel Blake. This was his last depicted \"death\" until 2007.\n* In 2002, Andr\u00e9 DiMera (posing as Tony) claimed that his uncle had died from injuries sustained from a car crash in [[Monte Carlo]].\n* In 2004, when Marlena and the presumed-dead Salem Stalker victims found a blackened, unrecognizable corpse on Melaswen, Andr\u00e9 (posing as Tony) claimed it was Stefano. Andr\u00e9 said he had killed Stefano by draining his blood so Andr\u00e9 could cure his own blood disease.\n* In 2007, his death was faked once again. As a setup by the Salem P.D., Steven \"Patch\" Johnson appeared to stab Stefano to death, but he was drugged and a fake funeral was set up to lure Andr\u00e9.\n* In 2012, Stefano DiMera was shot dead from behind after several characters confronted him about his crimes. On August 16, Ian McAllister claimed to have killed Stefano and on August 20, Ian admitted to EJ that he killed Stefano and planned to frame EJ for the murder. On August 21, it was revealed that Stefano was not killed. Ian used an impostor that looked like him named Paolo. He faked the letter that said EJ was not Stefano's son and faked their blood types in the hospital.\n* In 2016, Stefano was shot three times by Hope because of his alleged involvement in Bo's death. This is the last time Stefano was alive, but the story ends on an ambiguous note as to whether or not Stefano is still alive.\n\n==Notable possessions==\n\n* '''Phoenix Ring''': Stefano's most iconic possession. A gold ring with a black flat square on top. It is embroidered with a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], and said to be the reason why Stefano keeps coming back to life. During the 2009 DiMera-Kiriakis war, Stefano's son EJ wore the ring while Stefano was held captive. It can apparently bring Andre back to life as well, since he is the son of the Phoenix. This was briefly contradicted in 2007 when Andre was revealed to be posing as Tony (who was assumed to be Stefano's son), and therefore was Stefano's nephew, This corrected in 2015 when Andre was revealed to be Stefano's son. After Stefano's final death in 2016 his son Andre wore the ring until his death in 2018, Stefano's youngest son Chad currently wears the ring.  \n* '''Portrait''': Stefano's portrait has been hanging on the wall of the foyer of the DiMera mansion since 2007. The portrait is iconic and synonymous with Stefano's ownership of the mansion. Whenever he has lost possession of the mansion, the portrait is usually taken down. A safe is known to be hidden behind the portrait that contains valuable items to the DiMeras.\n* '''The key \"to ending the feud\"''': A gold key that Stefano kept around his neck. It was said to contain the secret to ending the Brady-DiMera feud.\n* '''Chess set''': Stefano had a passion for playing chess, and kept a chessboard. Whenever Stefano felt he had the upper hand, he would mirror his moves with chess pieces. Stefano would often refer to the people he would use as \"pawns\", and for the longest time the \"Queen\" symbolized [[Marlena Evans]], but Stefano would also use the \"Queen\" to symbolize any women that were important to his enemies. Stefano taught his sons Andre, EJ, and Chad and his grandson Theo to play chess and enjoyed playing chess with them. In 2016, when Hope shot Stefano, his hand symbolically knocked over all of the chess pieces as he fell back into his wheelchair. In 2017 it has been hinted that Stefano might be alive and that he manipulated all of Salem, the ISA and the Salem Police for over a year.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of soap opera villains]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/stefano.php Stefano at soapcentral.com]\n* [http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/features/dimera/stefano.shtml Stefano at NBC.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of our Lives characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dimera, Stefano}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Salemis a redirect, not an article.

They continued appearing on ''Radio Free Oz'', which later moved to [[KRLA 1110]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and then [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]], through February 1969. They produced fifteen [[album|record album]]s and a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]] under contract to\n[[Columbia Records]] from 1967 through 1976,<ref>This total includes one release on Columbia's subsidiary label, [[Epic Records]].</ref> and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour'' [sic] in 1970 on [[KPPC-FM]]; and ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]'' (1970\u20131971) and ''Let's Eat!'' (1971\u20131972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members Bergman, [[Philip Proctor]], [[Phil Austin]], and [[David Ossman]]. The group's name stems from [[astrology]], because all four were born under the three \"[[Astrology and the classical elements|fire signs]]\": [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] (Austin), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Proctor), and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s, and ebbed in the [[Reagan Era]]. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman's death in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the Firesign Theatre among the \"Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time\". Their 1970 album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' was nominated in 1971 for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] by the [[World Science Fiction Society]], and their next album ''[[I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus]]'' received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for three of their albums: ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'' (1984), ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'' (2001). In 2005, the US [[Library of Congress]] added ''Don't Crush That Dwarf'' to the [[National Recording Registry]] and called the group \"[[the Beatles]] of comedy.\"\n\n==Before ''Firesign''==\n[[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]] and [[Philip Proctor]] met while attending [[Yale University]] in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with [[Austin Pendleton]] in 1958 on two [[Yale Dramatic Association|Yale Dramat]] musicals in which Proctor starred: ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', and ''[[Edwin Booth|Booth]] Is Back In Town''.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\">{{cite web|title=Who Am Us, Anyway?

Bergman went backstage and struck up a friendship with Milligan.<ref name=\"Firezine_Goons\"/> Also that year, he saw [[the Beatles]] in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nOn returning to the US, Bergman started a late-night listener-participation [[talk radio|talk show]] ''Radio Free Oz'' on July 24, 1966, on listener-sponsored [[KPFK]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] in Los Angeles, working with [[radio producer|producer]]s [[Phil Austin]] and [[David Ossman]]. According to Austin, the show \"featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.\" Guests included the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group.\n\nBergman originally named the group the \"Oz Firesign Theatre\" because all four were born under the three [[astrological sign|astrological fire sign]]s (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and debuted them on his November 17, 1966 show. He had to drop \"Oz\" from the name after legal threats from [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]], who owned movie rights to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Return to Oz|other associated works]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n==''Radio Free Oz''==\nThe Firesigns initially chose an [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] style, and carried it to a level which revolutionized [[radio comedy]]. According to Proctor:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n{{Quote|We each independently created our own material and characters and brought them together, not knowing what the others were going to pull. And it was all based on put-ons; that is, we were assuming characters that were assumed to be real by the listeners. No matter how far out we would carry a premise, if we were tied to the phones we discovered the audience would go far ahead of us. We could be as outrageous as we wanted to be and they believed us\u2014which was astonishingly funny and interesting and terrifying to us, because it showed the power of the medium and the gullibility and vulnerability of most people.}}\n\nOn nights when he had no guests, Bergman would have the Firesigns come on the air and pretend (including himself) to be outrageously interesting guests. On their November 17, 1966 debut, they pretended to be the panel of an imaginary \"Oz Film Festival\": Bergman was film critic Peter Volta, \"writing a history of world cinema one frame at a time\"; Ossman was Raul Saez, maker of \u201cthrown camera\u201d films, who had just won a grant to roll a [[70 mm film]] camera down the [[Andes mountains]]; Austin was Jack Love, making \"Living Room Theatre\" porn films like ''The Nun'' and ''Blondie Pays the Rent''; and Proctor was Jean-Claude Jean-Claude, creator of the \"Nouvelle Nouvelle Vague Vague movement\" and director of a documentary ''Two Weeks With Fred'', which lasts a full two weeks.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/>\n\nBy 1967, Bergman had the Firesign Theatre appear regularly on ''Radio Free Oz''.<ref name=\"DearFriends_liner_notes\">{{cite AV media |people= |date=1972 |title= Dear Friends |trans-title= |medium=CD liner |language= |url=https://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=df-ln |access-date=March 27, 2020 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> The Firesigns were strongly influenced by the British ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]''; Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans since the [[NBC]] program ''[[Monitor (radio program)|Monitor]]'' broadcast ''Goon Show'' episodes in the late 1950s, and Bergman became a fan after forming the Firesigns.

The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: \"There was no leader.\" The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. \"Everything was communally written, and if one person didn't agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn't go in.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> \nThe resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: \"It's like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing.

Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with \"Temporarily Humboldt County\", a satire of the Europeans' displacement of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; followed by \"W. C. Fields Forever\", a satire of the 1960s [[hippie]] culture; leading into \"Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)\", a projected future in which the roles of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] and [[the Establishment]] culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a [[stream-of-consciousness]] play about an American tourist to an [[Eastern Bloc]] country (Proctor), who ends up in prison and is rescued by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It was recorded in [[CBS]]'s Los Angeles radio studio from which ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and others had been broadcast; the original [[RCA]] microphones and [[sound effects]] devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year.\n\nThe Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in [[folk club]]s such as the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> ''Radio Free Oz'' moved again to [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]] until February 1969. ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour''{{sic|nolink=y}} aired for two hours on Sunday nights on [[KPPC-FM]] in 1970.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> They would concentrate their writing on the folk club material, and produce improvisational skit material for the ''Radio Hour'' and its successors.\n\nThe Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: \"Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said 'This isn't funny\u2014this is dirty!' And to our rescue came [[James William Guercio]] [producer of [[the Buckinghams]]]\nand [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]].\" Austin says, \"With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971.

''Dwarf'' marked a high point in the Firesign's use of [[blue comedy]]: Porgie has explicit sex with the [[Negro]] housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1971 by the [[World Science Fiction Society]],<ref name=\"Hugo71\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |title=1971 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164616/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Dwarf'' brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, \"We toured after ''Dwarf'' and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Austin said of this period, \"At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously \u2014- ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' did a long article on us, and we were being compared to [[James Joyce]] \u2014- there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren't making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn't really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second ''Dwarf'', which to me is a real disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nTheir fourth album, ''[[I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus]]'' (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, [[PDP-10|early-technology computer]] [[security hacker|hacker]] (Proctor) and an older \"bozo\" with a large nose that honks like a clown's (Austin), who attend a [[Walt Disney World|Disneyesque]] Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse.

These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on [[12\" LP]] albums. Their fifth album, [[Dear Friends (album)|''Dear Friends'']], was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. ''Dear Friends'' was followed with the KPFK show ''Let's Eat!'' in 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his \"Hour of Reckoning\" program in ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''.\n\nIn 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the [[Shakespeare]] parody ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', at [[Columbia University]]. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it ''Anything You Want To'' for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> On March 30, they ended ''Let's Eat!'' with a live broadcast titled ''Martian Space Party'', which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album ''[[Not Insane or Anything You Want To]]''.

In the liner notes to the group\u2019s 1993 greatest hits album, ''[[Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre]]'', Bergman criticized ''Not Insane'', saying it \"was when the Firesign was splitting apart; it was a fractious, fragmented album.\" Ossman called it \"a serious mistake\" and said it \u201cwas incomprehensible, basically\u201d, and \u201cit was not the album it should have been and I think that caused us to slope off rapidly in sales.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Putting It Simply, There's Never Been Anything Like The Firesign Theatre Before or Since |title-link= |others= |year=1993 |chapter= |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=sfi-ln |access-date=November 28, 2017 |first=Steve |last=Simels |author-link= |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |page= |pages= |type=liner notes |publisher=Laugh.com |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215000610/http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=sfi-ln |archivedate=December 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe four decided to take a break from the group in 1973 to work in separate directions.

They turned this into a [[vaudeville]]-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey [[Wolfman Jack]].<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album ''[[How Time Flys]]'', based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a ''Dear Friends'' skit, used on ''I Think We're All Bozos'', and was cut from ''Not Insane''.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Steve Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, [[Harry Shearer]] of [[The Credibility Gap]], and broadcast journalist [[Lew Irwin]]. Mark returns on New Year's Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to [[Planet X]], only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric [[impresario]] (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life.\n\nAustin wrote the solo album ''[[Roller Maidens From Outer Space]]'', based on a [[hardboiled detective]] in the same vein as his [[Nick Danger]] character introduced on the B side of ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''. ''Roller Maidens'', released in March 1974 on Columbia's [[Epic Records|Epic label]], also featured all four Firesigns, and included actors [[Richard Paul (actor)|Richard Paul]] and [[Michael C. Gwynne]]. The album satirizes [[television show|series television]], [[televangelist]]s, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]].\n\n===Comedy style===\nThe Firesigns made use of [[inside joke|inside humor]]. They peppered ''Waiting for the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be in Two Places At Once'' with Beatles references not found on the band's [[top 40]] material:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Firesign characters would quote lyrics from songs such as \"[[The Word (song)|The Word]]\" and \"[[I'm So Tired]]\". The name of Danger's criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles' \"[[Rocky Raccoon]]\", and Danger's girlfriend has multiple names but \"everyone knew her as Nancy\" just like Rocky Raccoon's girlfriend.\n\nLater the Firesigns would create their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in ''Dwarf'', where George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from \"Nick's\".\n\n\"He's no fun, he fell right over\" became a famous [[catchphrase]] delivered by Austin in \"How Can You Be In Two Places at Once\" and repeated on side two in \"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\". This line was repeated on the albums ''Not Insane'' and ''How Time Flys''.\n\n===Reunion===\nThe group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the [[Sherlock Holmes]] parody ''[[The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra]]'',<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, ''By the Light of the Silvery''. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]] for Book Three of Ellison's [[anthology]] ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'', which Ellison never completed.\n\nIn October 1974, the Firesigns released their seventh album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'', which satirized the developing [[New Age]] movement. Ossman said this record \"grew out of our basic interest in those [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] things ... from [[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] to the [[hollow Earth]] theory to [[Uri Geller|the guy who bends spoons]]. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and 'cinematic' record; we were trying to write a radio movie.\" The Firesigns produced a film made by [[Allen Daviau]] (who later filmed ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'') using the album as the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The film was shown in a live appearance at [[Stanford University]] and released on [[VHS]] video tape in 1993.\n\nIn 1975, they released the [[black comedy]] album ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[police corruption|dirty cop]] (Proctor), whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose wife (Ossman) lives in a [[soap opera]]. In a parody of [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[45th Academy Awards|1973 Academy Awards protest]], the brother and sister stage a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on an [[Academy Awards|Oscar awards]] ceremony. This album, like ''Not Insane'', also sold poorly, and Columbia declined to offer them a third contract in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This time, the Firesigns didn't protest. Bergman said, \"The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn't have five more albums in us at that point.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n===Second split===\nAs Austin looked back on this period from September 1993, he wrote that he saw Proctor and Bergman wanting to take the Firesign Theatre in a different direction than he did, moving away from intensely written albums released one per year, to more live performances with lighter material.<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fighting Clowns |title-link= |year=1993 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |access-date=February 1, 2018 |first=Phil |last=Austin |author-link=Phil Austin |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226220607/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |archivedate=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proctor and Bergman turned their attention in 1975 to producing a live show recorded on the Columbia album ''[[What This Country Needs (Proctor and Bergman album)|What This Country Needs]]'', based in part on material from ''TV or Not TV'' and named for a song added to the show.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre closed out their Columbia Records contract with a greatest-hits compilation ''[[Forward Into the Past]]'' in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Meanwhile, Austin and Ossman toured the west coast, billing themselves as \"Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery\".<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/> They produced a live stage show ''Radio Laffs of 1940'', which included a second episode of the private eye character [[Nick Danger]], \"School For Actors\"; and a soap opera \"Over the Edge\".

A Firesign Chat]]'' based largely on unreleased ''Dear Friends'' and ''Let's Eat'' radio material. Proctor and Bergman appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the [[Starland Vocal Band]]. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 [[Golden Dragon Massacre]], and in 1978 released another studio album ''[[Give Us a Break (Proctor and Bergman album)|Give Us a Break]]'', which lampooned radio and television.

G. Kelly]]. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]]''.\n\nAustin called Bergman in late 1979 to make peace and reunite the Firesigns. This resulted in a series of shows performed at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles: \"The Owl and the Octopus Show\"; \"The Joey Demographico Show\"; \"Nick Danger: Men in Hats\"; and \"Welcome to Billville\". These included songs with music written by Austin, and were recorded; the live recordings were used to produce their last album of the decade, the 1980 ''[[Fighting Clowns]]''.

They also released a 1993 greatest hits album, ''[[Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre]]'' containing original material from the first nine albums, ''TV or Not TV'', and ''Roller Maidens From Outer Space''.\n\nIn 1996, Bergman revived ''Radio Free Oz'' as an [[Internet]]-based radio station, www.rfo.net, calling it \"the Internet's funny bone.\"<ref>[http://www.filmkauai.com/cafe/PeterBergman/ ''PeterBergman'']; Filmkauai.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724101449/http://www.filmkauai.com/cafe/PeterBergman/ |date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Firesigns followed this with the 1998 album ''[[Pink Hotel Burns Down]]'', a collection of material from two 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, ''Exorcism In Your Daily Life'' and their early Sherlock Holmes parody \"By the Light of the Silvery\"; two cuts, \"The Pink Hotel\" and \"The Sand Bar\" from their video game record that eventually became ''Eat or Be Eaten''; the soap opera \"Over the Edge\" from Austin and Ossman's 1976 ''Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery'' tour, and several clips from their radio work, including the earliest recorded appearance on ''Radio Free Oz''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Pink Hotel Burns Down |title-link= |others= |year=1998 |chapter= |url=https://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=phbd-ln |access-date=March 20, 2020 |first= |last= |author-link= |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |page= |pages= |type=Liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=}}</ref>\n\nThe Firesigns satirized the turn-of-the-millennium [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K scare]] with the 1998 album ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]'', in which they revived some of their classic characters such as used car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Proctor) from ''How Can You Be In Two Places At Once'', news reporters Harold Hiphugger (Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Proctor) from ''Everything You Know Is Wrong'', and game-show contestant Caroline Presskey (Proctor) from ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''. This earned them their second Grammy nomination, and they developed it into a \"millennium trilogy\" with the 1999 ''[[Boom Dot Bust]]'' and 2001 ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'', which received a third Grammy nomination.<ref name=NPR/> ''Boom Dot Bust'' used material from their 1979 Roxy show \"Welcome to Billville\".\n\nThey created a live show, ''[[Radio Now Live]]'' in 2001 using characters from ''Give Me Immortality'' and released it on a live album, which also includes updated cuts from ''Anythynge You Want To''.\n\nIn December 2001, the Firesigns appeared in a 90-minute [[PBS]] television show ''[[Weirdly Cool]]''. This contained live, updated performance material based on ''Waiting for the Electrician'', ''How Can You Be in Two Places...'', and ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''; and included interviews and two Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials.\n\nFrom November 2002 through early 2003, Bergman produced a political satire series ''True Confessions of the Real World'', three times weekly on Pasadena non-commercial [[KPCC]] FM.<ref name=\"BergmanObit\"/> He would script fake interviews with imaginary \"newsmakers\".<ref name=\"TrueConfessions\">{{cite web |title=True Confessions of the Real World |url=https://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=tcotrw |website=Firesigntheatre.com |publisher=Firesign Media |accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Firesigns appeared on the [[NPR]] show ''[[All Things Considered]]'' on US holidays from July 4 to December 31, 2002;<ref name=\"NPR\"/> these were compiled on a CD, ''[[All Things Firesign]]''.

He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961), and was managing editor of the university's comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the [[Yale Dramatic Association]], he co-wrote two musical comedies with [[Austin Pendleton]]. Later, he considered attending medical school, and helped produce a machine for viewing angio cardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\"/> He had a deep voice, and frequently took African American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works.\n\n[[File:Philip Proctor 05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35]]\n[[Philip Proctor]] (born under the fire sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] in Goshen, Indiana<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children's choir, and studied acting at Yale. There, he met his future partner Bergman in the Yale Dramatic Association, where he starred in the two musical comedies written by Bergman and Pendleton. He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', before contacting Bergman and joining him on ''Radio Free Oz'' in 1966. Proctor's adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using [[falsetto]]; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including [[W.C. Fields]] (''Waiting For the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''), [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (''Waiting For the Electrician''), and a [[Peter Lorre]]-like voice for the Nick Danger character Rocky Rococo (''Box of Danger''). Proctor has also acted and appeared as a voice actor on many television shows and several feature films.\n\n[[File:Philip Austin 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6]]\n[[Phil Austin]] (born under the fire sign [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] in Denver, Colorado<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> on April 6, 1941; died June 18, 2015), was the youngest Firesign.

He also could do an old-man voice as Doc Technical in the ''Dear Friends'' radio \"Mark Time\" episode, and applied his impersonation of [[Richard Nixon]] as presidents in several Firesign and solo works (''Bozos'', ''How Time Flys'', ''Roller Maidens'', and ''Everything You Know Is Wrong'').

But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their \"golden age\", they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain's lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Since the creator of the [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan the Barbarian'' comic]] had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], so the Firesigns settled out of court.<ref name=\"IB_news\"/>\n\n===Mark Time awards===\nOssman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce [[audio theatre]].

They continued appearing on ''Radio Free Oz'', which later moved to [[KRLA 1110]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and then [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]], through February 1969. They produced fifteen [[album|record album]]s and a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]] under contract to\n[[Columbia Records]] from 1967 through 1976,<ref>This total includes one release on Columbia's subsidiary label, [[Epic Records]].</ref> and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour'' [sic] in 1970 on [[KPPC-FM]]; and ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]'' (1970\u20131971) and ''Let's Eat!'' (1971\u20131972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members Bergman, [[Philip Proctor]], [[Phil Austin]], and [[David Ossman]]. The group's name stems from [[astrology]], because all four were born under the three \"[[Astrology and the classical elements|fire signs]]\": [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] (Austin), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Proctor), and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s, and ebbed in the [[Reagan Era]]. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman's death in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the Firesign Theatre among the \"Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time\". Their 1970 album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' was nominated in 1971 for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] by the [[World Science Fiction Society]], and their next album ''[[I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus]]'' received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for three of their albums: ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'' (1984), ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'' (2001). In 2005, the US [[Library of Congress]] added ''Don't Crush That Dwarf'' to the [[National Recording Registry]] and called the group \"[[the Beatles]] of comedy.\"\n\n==Before ''Firesign''==\n[[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]] and [[Philip Proctor]] met while attending [[Yale University]] in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with [[Austin Pendleton]] in 1958 on two [[Yale Dramatic Association|Yale Dramat]] musicals in which Proctor starred: ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', and ''[[Edwin Booth|Booth]] Is Back In Town''.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\">{{cite web|title=Who Am Us, Anyway?

Bergman went backstage and struck up a friendship with Milligan.<ref name=\"Firezine_Goons\"/> Also that year, he saw [[the Beatles]] in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nOn returning to the US, Bergman started a late-night listener-participation [[talk radio|talk show]] ''Radio Free Oz'' on July 24, 1966, on listener-sponsored [[KPFK]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] in Los Angeles, working with [[radio producer|producer]]s [[Phil Austin]] and [[David Ossman]]. According to Austin, the show \"featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.\" Guests included the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group.\n\nBergman originally named the group the \"Oz Firesign Theatre\" because all four were born under the three [[astrological sign|astrological fire sign]]s (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and debuted them on his November 17, 1966 show. He had to drop \"Oz\" from the name after legal threats from [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]], who owned movie rights to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Return to Oz|other associated works]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n==''Radio Free Oz''==\nThe Firesigns initially chose an [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] style, and carried it to a level which revolutionized [[radio comedy]]. According to Proctor:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n{{Quote|We each independently created our own material and characters and brought them together, not knowing what the others were going to pull. And it was all based on put-ons; that is, we were assuming characters that were assumed to be real by the listeners. No matter how far out we would carry a premise, if we were tied to the phones we discovered the audience would go far ahead of us. We could be as outrageous as we wanted to be and they believed us\u2014which was astonishingly funny and interesting and terrifying to us, because it showed the power of the medium and the gullibility and vulnerability of most people.}}\n\nOn nights when he had no guests, Bergman would have the Firesigns come on the air and pretend (including himself) to be outrageously interesting guests. On their November 17, 1966 debut, they pretended to be the panel of an imaginary \"Oz Film Festival\": Bergman was film critic Peter Volta, \"writing a history of world cinema one frame at a time\"; Ossman was Raul Saez, maker of \u201cthrown camera\u201d films, who had just won a grant to roll a [[70 mm film]] camera down the [[Andes mountains]]; Austin was Jack Love, making \"Living Room Theatre\" porn films like ''The Nun'' and ''Blondie Pays the Rent''; and Proctor was Jean-Claude Jean-Claude, creator of the \"Nouvelle Nouvelle Vague Vague movement\" and director of a documentary ''Two Weeks With Fred'', which lasts a full two weeks.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/>\n\nBy 1967, Bergman had the Firesign Theatre appear regularly on ''Radio Free Oz''.<ref name=\"DearFriends_liner_notes\">{{cite AV media |people= |date=1972 |title= Dear Friends |trans-title= |medium=CD liner |language= |url=https://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=df-ln |access-date=March 27, 2020 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> The Firesigns were strongly influenced by the British ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]''; Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans since the [[NBC]] program ''[[Monitor (radio program)|Monitor]]'' broadcast ''Goon Show'' episodes in the late 1950s, and Bergman became a fan after forming the Firesigns.

Bergman countered with a proposal for a Firesign Theatre album, and this led to a five-year<ref>According to Ossman's ''Martian Space Party Diary'', Columbia signed the Firesigns to a second five-year contract on March 9, 1972.</ref> recording contract with the label.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Usher also used the Firesigns' audio collages on songs by [[The Byrds]] (\"Draft Morning\") and [[Sagittarius (band)|Sagittarius]] (the [[Single (music)|45 RPM]] version of \"Hotel Indiscreet\") in 1967 and 1968.\n\nThe album was given the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] title ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', from Bergman's undeveloped 1965 idea for a comic film. The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: \"There was no leader.\" The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. \"Everything was communally written, and if one person didn't agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn't go in.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> \nThe resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: \"It's like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing. We all vaguely sort of know him, and a lot of the time take credit for him.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This resulted in the group inventing the name \"4 or 5 Krazy Guys Publishing\" to copyright their work.<ref name=\"Bozos_liner_notes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus |title-link= |year=1971 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |access-date=April 4, 2019 |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401143251/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |archivedate=April 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their contract with Columbia, in exchange for a low royalty rate, gave them unlimited studio time, allowing them to perfect their writing and recording.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''Electrician'' revolutionized the concept of the [[comedy album]]: it consists of four radio plays. Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with \"Temporarily Humboldt County\", a satire of the Europeans' displacement of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; followed by \"W. C. Fields Forever\", a satire of the 1960s [[hippie]] culture; leading into \"Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)\", a projected future in which the roles of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] and [[the Establishment]] culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a [[stream-of-consciousness]] play about an American tourist to an [[Eastern Bloc]] country (Proctor), who ends up in prison and is rescued by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It was recorded in [[CBS]]'s Los Angeles radio studio from which ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and others had been broadcast; the original [[RCA]] microphones and [[sound effects]] devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year.\n\nThe Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in [[folk club]]s such as the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> ''Radio Free Oz'' moved again to [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]] until February 1969. ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour''{{sic|nolink=y}} aired for two hours on Sunday nights on [[KPPC-FM]] in 1970.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> They would concentrate their writing on the folk club material, and produce improvisational skit material for the ''Radio Hour'' and its successors.\n\nThe Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: \"Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said 'This isn't funny\u2014this is dirty!' And to our rescue came [[James William Guercio]] [producer of [[the Buckinghams]]]\nand [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]].\" Austin says, \"With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971. Each grew technically more sophisticated, taking advantage of [[multitrack recording|up to 16 tape tracks]] and [[Dolby noise reduction]] by 1970.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', released in 1969, consists of a stream-of-consciousness play on side one about a man named Babe (Bergman) who buys a car and goes on a road trip that turns into a parody of [[Norman Corwin]]'s 1941 patriotic radio pageant ''[[We Hold These Truths]]''.<ref>[http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm CD Liner Notes by David Ossman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026043336/http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm |date=2006-10-26 }}</ref> Side two, ''The Further Adventures of [[Nick Danger]]'', is a parody of 1940s radio, about a [[hard-boiled detective]] (Austin) who became possibly the Firesigns' most famous character.\n\n''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' (1970) is a single play centered around an actor named George Tirebiter (Ossman), who gradually ages into an old man while watching his old movies on television: a [[the Aldrich Family|Henry Aldrich]] parody ''High School Madness'' (in which he is named Porgie Tirebiter), and the [[Korean War]] film ''Parallel Hell''. ''Dwarf'' marked a high point in the Firesign's use of [[blue comedy]]: Porgie has explicit sex with the [[Negro]] housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1971 by the [[World Science Fiction Society]],<ref name=\"Hugo71\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |title=1971 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164616/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Dwarf'' brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, \"We toured after ''Dwarf'' and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Austin said of this period, \"At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously \u2014- ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' did a long article on us, and we were being compared to [[James Joyce]] \u2014- there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren't making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn't really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second ''Dwarf'', which to me is a real disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nTheir fourth album, ''[[I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus]]'' (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, [[PDP-10|early-technology computer]] [[security hacker|hacker]] (Proctor) and an older \"bozo\" with a large nose that honks like a clown's (Austin), who attend a [[Walt Disney World|Disneyesque]] Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse. This album also received a Hugo nomination in 1972.<ref name=\"Hugo72\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |title=1972 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164619/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, from September 9, 1970 to February 17, 1971, they were performing a one-hour weekly live series on KPFK, ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]''. These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on [[12\" LP]] albums. Their fifth album, [[Dear Friends (album)|''Dear Friends'']], was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. ''Dear Friends'' was followed with the KPFK show ''Let's Eat!'' in 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his \"Hour of Reckoning\" program in ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''.\n\nIn 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the [[Shakespeare]] parody ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', at [[Columbia University]]. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it ''Anything You Want To'' for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> On March 30, they ended ''Let's Eat!'' with a live broadcast titled ''Martian Space Party'', which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album ''[[Not Insane or Anything You Want To]]''.

In the liner notes to the group\u2019s 1993 greatest hits album, ''[[Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre]]'', Bergman criticized ''Not Insane'', saying it \"was when the Firesign was splitting apart; it was a fractious, fragmented album.\" Ossman called it \"a serious mistake\" and said it \u201cwas incomprehensible, basically\u201d, and \u201cit was not the album it should have been and I think that caused us to slope off rapidly in sales.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Putting It Simply, There's Never Been Anything Like The Firesign Theatre Before or Since |title-link= |others= |year=1993 |chapter= |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=sfi-ln |access-date=November 28, 2017 |first=Steve |last=Simels |author-link= |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |page= |pages= |type=liner notes |publisher=Laugh.com |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215000610/http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=sfi-ln |archivedate=December 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe four decided to take a break from the group in 1973 to work in separate directions.

They turned this into a [[vaudeville]]-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey [[Wolfman Jack]].<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album ''[[How Time Flys]]'', based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a ''Dear Friends'' skit, used on ''I Think We're All Bozos'', and was cut from ''Not Insane''.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Steve Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, [[Harry Shearer]] of [[The Credibility Gap]], and broadcast journalist [[Lew Irwin]]. Mark returns on New Year's Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to [[Planet X]], only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric [[impresario]] (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life.\n\nAustin wrote the solo album ''[[Roller Maidens From Outer Space]]'', based on a [[hardboiled detective]] in the same vein as his [[Nick Danger]] character introduced on the B side of ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''. ''Roller Maidens'', released in March 1974 on Columbia's [[Epic Records|Epic label]], also featured all four Firesigns, and included actors [[Richard Paul (actor)|Richard Paul]] and [[Michael C. Gwynne]]. The album satirizes [[television show|series television]], [[televangelist]]s, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]].\n\n===Comedy style===\nThe Firesigns made use of [[inside joke|inside humor]]. They peppered ''Waiting for the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be in Two Places At Once'' with Beatles references not found on the band's [[top 40]] material:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Firesign characters would quote lyrics from songs such as \"[[The Word (song)|The Word]]\" and \"[[I'm So Tired]]\". The name of Danger's criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles' \"[[Rocky Raccoon]]\", and Danger's girlfriend has multiple names but \"everyone knew her as Nancy\" just like Rocky Raccoon's girlfriend.\n\nLater the Firesigns would create their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in ''Dwarf'', where George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from \"Nick's\".\n\n\"He's no fun, he fell right over\" became a famous [[catchphrase]] delivered by Austin in \"How Can You Be In Two Places at Once\" and repeated on side two in \"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\". This line was repeated on the albums ''Not Insane'' and ''How Time Flys''.\n\n===Reunion===\nThe group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the [[Sherlock Holmes]] parody ''[[The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra]]'',<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, ''By the Light of the Silvery''. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]] for Book Three of Ellison's [[anthology]] ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'', which Ellison never completed.\n\nIn October 1974, the Firesigns released their seventh album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'', which satirized the developing [[New Age]] movement. Ossman said this record \"grew out of our basic interest in those [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] things ... from [[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] to the [[hollow Earth]] theory to [[Uri Geller|the guy who bends spoons]]. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and 'cinematic' record; we were trying to write a radio movie.\" The Firesigns produced a film made by [[Allen Daviau]] (who later filmed ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'') using the album as the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The film was shown in a live appearance at [[Stanford University]] and released on [[VHS]] video tape in 1993.\n\nIn 1975, they released the [[black comedy]] album ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[police corruption|dirty cop]] (Proctor), whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose wife (Ossman) lives in a [[soap opera]]. In a parody of [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[45th Academy Awards|1973 Academy Awards protest]], the brother and sister stage a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on an [[Academy Awards|Oscar awards]] ceremony. This album, like ''Not Insane'', also sold poorly, and Columbia declined to offer them a third contract in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This time, the Firesigns didn't protest. Bergman said, \"The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn't have five more albums in us at that point.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n===Second split===\nAs Austin looked back on this period from September 1993, he wrote that he saw Proctor and Bergman wanting to take the Firesign Theatre in a different direction than he did, moving away from intensely written albums released one per year, to more live performances with lighter material.<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fighting Clowns |title-link= |year=1993 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |access-date=February 1, 2018 |first=Phil |last=Austin |author-link=Phil Austin |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226220607/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |archivedate=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proctor and Bergman turned their attention in 1975 to producing a live show recorded on the Columbia album ''[[What This Country Needs (Proctor and Bergman album)|What This Country Needs]]'', based in part on material from ''TV or Not TV'' and named for a song added to the show.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre closed out their Columbia Records contract with a greatest-hits compilation ''[[Forward Into the Past]]'' in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Meanwhile, Austin and Ossman toured the west coast, billing themselves as \"Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery\".<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/> They produced a live stage show ''Radio Laffs of 1940'', which included a second episode of the private eye character [[Nick Danger]], \"School For Actors\"; and a soap opera \"Over the Edge\". This was performed at the Los Feliz Theatre in Los Angeles in May 1976, and at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco in June.<ref name=\"BoxOfDanger\"/> Austin wrote in 1993 that this tour \"was meant to be an antidote to confusion but ... had not turned out to be much fun at all\".<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/>\n\nThe Firesigns took it easy for the rest of the 1970s, producing a 1977 album ''[[Just Folks... A Firesign Chat]]'' based largely on unreleased ''Dear Friends'' and ''Let's Eat'' radio material. Proctor and Bergman appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the [[Starland Vocal Band]]. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 [[Golden Dragon Massacre]], and in 1978 released another studio album ''[[Give Us a Break (Proctor and Bergman album)|Give Us a Break]]'', which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic [[bumper music|radio breaks]] on this album.<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\n[[Norman Lear]] and [[Bud Yorkin]]'s [[Tandem Productions]] bought the rights to Nick Danger for a TV series to star [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]]; and in 1978, [[New Line Cinema]] began negotiations to make a movie starring [[Chevy Chase]].

When the syndication went unsold, Austin approached [[Rhino Records]] and secured a deal to release the five episodes in 1979 on a 12-minute [[extended play]] (EP) record.<ref name=\"BoxOfDanger\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, ''[[J-Men Forever]]'', using clips from old [[Republic Pictures]] [[movie serial]]s with [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as \"the Lightning Bug\" voiced by disk jockey [[M. G. Kelly]]. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]]''.\n\nAustin called Bergman in late 1979 to make peace and reunite the Firesigns. This resulted in a series of shows performed at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles: \"The Owl and the Octopus Show\"; \"The Joey Demographico Show\"; \"Nick Danger: Men in Hats\"; and \"Welcome to Billville\". These included songs with music written by Austin, and were recorded; the live recordings were used to produce their last album of the decade, the 1980 ''[[Fighting Clowns]]''. They also produced a show, \"Presidents in Hell\" ([[FDR]], [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]), which was not recorded.<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/>\n\n==Reagan Era==\n{{Quote frame|...there was something about the Eighties \u2013 the anti-surrealist<br /> politics of the Eighties \u2013 that was wrong for the Firesign Theatre. |author=David Ossman<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> |align=right}}\nThe popularity of the group cooled off after 1980 as the social and political climate of the United States changed with the [[Reagan Era|election of President Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In 1982, they produced the album ''[[Lawyer's Hospital]]'' from a collection of live appearances, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) performances, and the Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials from ''Radio Free Oz''. They also expanded their 1972 Shakespeare parody into a road show, ''Shakespeare's Lost Comedie'' and released it on a 1982 vinyl LP, which required editing down; it would be re-released uncut on CD in 2001 and retitled ''[[Anythynge You Want To]]''.\n\nOssman left the group in early 1982 to take a producer's job for NPR in Washington DC.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/><ref name=\"BoxOfDanger\"/> The remaining three Firesigns produced a new album in 1984, ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'', with the further adventures of Nick Danger.

He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961), and was managing editor of the university's comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the [[Yale Dramatic Association]], he co-wrote two musical comedies with [[Austin Pendleton]]. Later, he considered attending medical school, and helped produce a machine for viewing angio cardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\"/> He had a deep voice, and frequently took African American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works.\n\n[[File:Philip Proctor 05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35]]\n[[Philip Proctor]] (born under the fire sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] in Goshen, Indiana<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children's choir, and studied acting at Yale.

He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', before contacting Bergman and joining him on ''Radio Free Oz'' in 1966. Proctor's adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using [[falsetto]]; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including [[W.C. Fields]] (''Waiting For the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''), [[Robert F.

But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their \"golden age\", they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain's lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Since the creator of the [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan the Barbarian'' comic]] had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], so the Firesigns settled out of court.<ref name=\"IB_news\"/>\n\n===Mark Time awards===\nOssman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce [[audio theatre]].

They are among the least attractive birds-of-paradise, being a dull brownish-olive on their upperside, with a greyish-brown underside. Their [[head]]s are dark brown, and one of their most noticeable features are lead-grey bare facial patches surrounding each [[eye]] and covering most of the head; there are also two iridescent tufts rising above the head. Unlike their [[Black-billed sicklebill|congener's]] bill, they have a pale, [[ivory]]-ish colored, downcurved bill. The ornaments present on the male are relatively extensive pectoral feathers in rows on the sides of the breast and belly. The pectoral feathers highest on the breast (on each side) are dark greyish with coppery red to reddish iridescent tips; the rest of the pectoral plumes on the sides are have more of a greenish-copper iridescence to their tips. The female of this species is, for the most part, similar to the male. She has no iridescent feathers, and is of lighter weight than the male. She does have the bare facial patches like the male, but not as extensive. Instead of a greyish underside, she is barred below, starting from her chin to her [[Rump (animal)|rump]]. Her [[wing]]s and lower [[neck]] are also a lighter dull brownish-olive. Both [[sex]]es have a rufous to buff-colored tail, purplish-lead grey legs and feet, and dark brown [[Eye color|irises]].\n\nThe call of the pale-billed sicklebill consists of musical whistling and some high pitched notes.\n\n== Behavior and Ecology ==\nThe pale-billed sicklebill is distributed to [[lowland]] rainforests of northern and northwestern [[New Guinea]]. Its diet consists mainly of fruits and [[arthropods]].\n\nDue to [[deforestation]] and [[habitat loss|habitat lost]] on this limited range species, the pale-billed sicklebill is evaluated as Near Threatened on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of [[CITES]].\n\n==Description==\nThe pale-billed sicklebill is medium-sized, about 35&nbsp;cm long, olive brown. The male has a bare purple grey skin around its eye, brown [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], pale [[sickle]]-like [[Beak|bill]], an iridescent red and purple-tipped upper breast plumes, blue and green-tipped ornamental lower breast feathers and purple small horn-like brow feathers. The unadorned female is smaller and paler than the male.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=5819&m=0 BirdLife Species Factsheet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145912/http://www.rdb.or.id/detailbird.php?id=531 Red Data Book]\n\n{{Birds-of-paradise}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2109368}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:sicklebill, pale-billed}}\n[[Category:Drepanornis|pale-billed sicklebiill]]\n[[Category:Birds of New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1880|pale-billed sicklebiill]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| name = Pale-billed sicklebill\n| image = Drepanornis bruijnii - The birds of New Guinea (cropped).jpg\n| status = NT\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22706160/0 |title=''Epimachus bruijnii'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Drepanornis\n| species = bruijnii\n| authority = [[\u00c9mile Oustalet|Oustalet]], 1880\n| synonyms = ''Epimachus bruijnii''\n}}\nThe '''Pale-billed Sicklebill''' (''Drepanornis bruijnii'') is a species of sicklebill that belongs to the [[Bird-of-paradise|Paradisaeidae]] family, which contains the renowned birds-of-paradise.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe scientific nomenclature, or name, of this species is ''Drepanornis bruijni,'' consisting of \"Drepanornis\", which means \"Sickle Bird\", that refers to the birds' sickle-shaped bill, and ''bruijni'', which commemorates [[Antonie Augustus Bruijn]], a Dutch plume merchant. \n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - ZMA.AVES.16684 - Drepanornis bruijnii Oustalet, 1880 - Paradisaeidae - skin specimen.jpeg|left|thumb|Male specimen at the [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]].]]\nPale-billed Sicklebills are on the more medium-sized side of the [[Bird-of-paradise|Paradisaeidae]] family; they seldom reach over 35 cm, or 13.7 inches, in length.

Unlike their [[Black-billed sicklebill|congener's]] bill, they have a pale, [[ivory]]-ish colored, downcurved bill. The ornaments present on the male are relatively extensive pectoral feathers in rows on the sides of the breast and belly. The pectoral feathers highest on the breast (on each side) are dark greyish with coppery red to reddish iridescent tips; the rest of the pectoral plumes on the sides are have more of a greenish-copper iridescence to their tips. The female of this species is, for the most part, similar to the male. She has no iridescent feathers, and is of lighter weight than the male. She does have the bare facial patches like the male, but not as extensive. Instead of a greyish underside, she is barred below, starting from her chin to her [[Rump (animal)|rump]]. Her [[Wing|wings]] and lower [[neck]] are also a lighter dull brownish-olive. Both [[Sex|sexes]] have a rufous to buff-colored tail, purplish-lead grey legs and feet, and dark brown [[Eye color|irises]]. \n\nThe call of the Pale-billed Sicklebill consists of musical whistling and some high pitched notes. \n\n== Behavior and Ecology ==\nThe pale-billed sicklebill is distributed to [[lowland]] rainforests of northern and northwestern [[New Guinea]]. Its diet consists mainly of fruits and [[arthropods]].\n\nDue to [[deforestation]] and [[habitat loss|habitat lost]] on this limited range species, the pale-billed sicklebill is evaluated as Near Threatened on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of [[CITES]].\n\n==Description==\nThe pale-billed sicklebill is medium-sized, about 35&nbsp;cm long, olive brown. The male has a bare purple grey skin around its eye, brown [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], pale [[sickle]]-like [[Beak|bill]], an iridescent red and purple-tipped upper breast plumes, blue and green-tipped ornamental lower breast feathers and purple small horn-like brow feathers. The unadorned female is smaller and paler than the male.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=5819&m=0 BirdLife Species Factsheet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061013145912/http://www.rdb.or.id/detailbird.php?id=531 Red Data Book]\n\n{{Birds-of-paradise}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2109368}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:sicklebill, pale-billed}}\n[[Category:Drepanornis|pale-billed sicklebiill]]\n[[Category:Birds of New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1880|pale-billed sicklebiill]]\n\n\n{{Paradisaeidae-stub}}\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, removed stub tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale-billed_sicklebill"}

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Northrop was later recast as another new character, [[Alex North (fiction)|Dr. Alex North]], and scenes from Northrop's time playing Roman were edited to create the new character's backstory.\n\n==Characterization==\nRoman is the retired police commissioner of the fictional Midwestern town of Salem, and currently manages and tends bar at his family's business, the Brady Pub. He is also a former agent of the fictional [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|International Security Alliance]] (ISA), a spy agency focused on all sorts of unusually high-level global conspiracies that tended to center around his otherwise-quiet home town. During his portrayal by Northrop, he was established as a top-notch cop but also a bit of a renegade, often accepting deep-cover assignments, and a master of disguise (similar to Sherlock Holmes). Hogestyn's character was more by-the-book on the job, although still dangerous with a dark side somewhat characteristic of an ex-spy (which later fed into the \"John Black\" persona), with expertise in [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Jeet Kune Do]], and a little more of a ladies' man. Taylor's portrayal is more that of a \"regular guy\", with a bit less intrigue and more straightforward professionally, although still with an eye for the ladies and more inclined to engage in [[one night stand|one-night stands]] with various women than the character as portrayed by Northrop or Hogestyn (such as with Kate Roberts, Billie Reed, ex-wives Anna DiMera and Marlena Evans, and a strongly hinted at \u2013 but never confirmed \u2013 rendezvous with Nicole Walker).\n\nOver the years, much has been made of the creation (and constant [[retcon]] of the backstory) of [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn's]] character John Black as an entirely separate character than that of Roman Brady, especially after the show had invested over five years in establishing John's identity as Roman, complete with a plausible backstory of his \u201ctime away\u201d (while he was being held captive, brainwashed, and trained\u2014-unsuccessfully\u2014-to be an assassin by Stefano DiMera), and \"Roman's\" reemerging memories. However, with Roman's recasts and changes in characterization over the years (while John has consistently been played by Hogestyn), in hindsight it can be said that it was actually John Black that remained more true to the original \"Roman\" persona, and that it was Roman that was gradually developed into a separate character. This was especially illustrated in 2016 when Roman, who had always been a straight-shooter with regard to the law, became complicit in the cover-up of sister-in-law [[Hope Brady]]'s murder of [[Stefano DiMera]], who she wrongly believed was responsible for the disappearance and later death of her husband (and Roman's brother) [[Bo Brady]].\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===1981\u201384===\nRoman Brady first appeared on Days to protect Marlena Evans from a serial killer.<ref>Days of Our Lives Episode dated January 8, 1982</ref> He slept on her floor. The chemistry between the actors, and the characters, led to love. In 1983 on Days of Our Lives, Roman and Marlena were married. Over the next year Roman became embroiled in a storyline with Stefano DiMera. Stefano was a powerful and ruthless business tycoon (and organized crime figure) from Europe who had come to town to set up shop in Salem, and Roman being the city's top cop had gone after him. Subsequently Stefano framed Roman for serial killings that were being committed by his nephew Andre DiMera. At the time Marlena saw Roman killing a woman. Later it was shown that Andre had used a realistic mask. Roman was jailed. Mrs. Alice Horton baked him some drugged doughnuts, and on the way to the hospital Roman escaped. He went on the run to prove his innocence, and he accomplished that. He was promoted, and Stefano was on the run.\n\nIn November 1984 Roman tracked Stefano to a Caribbean island where many other characters had crash-landed, too. Stefano was suffering from incurable cancer, and needed to collect three mysterious prisms to unlock a secret formula to cure himself. Roman caught up to him on a cliff, but Stefano pulled a gun. He shot Roman, who seemingly fell to his death. His brother Bo cradled him in his arms on the beach, but had to leave him for a few minutes. When he returned the body was gone. Bo assumed that while he was away, the tide had come in and washed Roman\u2019s body out to sea, for which Bo blamed himself for years. Several episodes later Roman was shown aboard Stefano's yacht, motionless.\n\n===1986\u20131990===\n:{{main|John Black (Days of our Lives)}}\nIn 1986 an amnesiac known only as \"The Pawn\" appeared in Salem on January 23, 1986.<ref>Lucille Giordano, Inside Days of Our Lives July 1995.</ref> He assumed the name \"John Black\" after reading it on a Vietnam War memorial in Salem. Eventually the character was revealed to be Roman Brady having undergone extensive plastic surgery, brainwashing, and martial arts training (purportedly to be trained as an assassin) by Stefano DiMera. After an uneasy \"re-introduction\" to his family and friends in Salem, the character resumed his life as Roman.\n\nIn 1988, a storyline featuring a reappearance by Stefano (who had been believed dead) focused on what had happened to Roman during his time in captivity (1984\u20131986). Roman and loved ones traveled back to the Caribbean island where Roman had \"died\" in 1984, and it was revealed that the ISA knew all along that Roman was being held by Stefano and being trained via brainwashing, and extensive instruction by a martial arts master named Orion Hawk, to be one of Stefano's assassins. In fact, the ISA unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate Orion's training camp to extract Roman, but this failed due to the high level of security at Stefano's compound as well as Roman's brainwashed state. This tied into the introduction of [[Benjy Hawk|Benjy]], Stefano's son (and Orion's grandson) who was fostered for a while by [[Steve Johnson (Days of our Lives)|Steve]] and [[Kayla Johnson]]. Although subtle hints pointed to the possibility of this \"Roman\" turning out to be someone else, abetted by speculation by fans and by [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn]] himself, the clues seemed to tie back together with the resolution that, at least for the moment, the character portrayed by Hogestyn was in fact Roman Brady.\n\n===1991\u201394===\nAfter believing that Roman's wife, Marlena Evans, had been dead for some years, he had fallen in love with a woman named [[Isabella Toscano]]. In 1991 Marlena turns up alive. In August 1991 the character who had been presumed as Roman Brady since 1986 is retroactively revealed to be a separate character (now once again called John Black) who was brainwashed to believe he was Roman, when what would now be the real Roman (once again played by Wayne Northrop) was found on an island where he had been imprisoned by Stefano. Roman was shocked when he found he had been replaced and all his family had accepted John Black as him and John Black had a difficult time accepting he was not really Roman. Roman went back to his life, and he and Marlena tried to live once again as man and wife. After the death of Isabella, in his grief John turned to Marlena for comfort. The two found themselves unable to resolve their feelings for each other from their life together when John believed himself to be Roman. He and Marlena had an affair that resulted in the birth of a daughter, [[Belle Black|Isabella]], named after [[Isabella Toscano]], whom Roman believed to be his own daughter. When he discovered that Marlena and John had an affair and that Belle was not his real daughter, Roman was crushed. In June 1994, Roman leaves town broken and bitter, once again with no family.<ref>{{cite episode|series= Days Of Our Lives |series-link= Days of Our Lives |number = 7304|network=[[NBC]]|credits= [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] ([[Executive producer]]s); [[James E.

The cure to his ailment was discovered by John, Hope, and Stefano in a jungle mission that was engineered to drive John and Marlena apart, but in the end had the opposite result.\n\nRoman was \"killed\" during the Salem Stalker Murders in December 2003 during his wedding reception to Kate Roberts, but again was revealed to not really be dead. He lived on the island of Melaswen (New Salem) with every other victim from the Salem Stalker Murders, including Marlena. Eventually, other Salemites arrived on the island, trying to find their \"dead\" loved ones. Some of them went out in the jungle, looking for a way off the island, while the rest remained in \"Salem\" waiting for help. Help finally arrived. Jennifer got to the island, then Hope and Patrick and finally Bo and John. Everyone banded together to get off the island, but Tony wasn't going to make it easy. He created a volcanic eruption, which eventually caused a giant wave. As everyone gathered on makeshift rafts to get off the island, the wave crashed over them. The Coast Guard arrived and managed to rescue some of them, but Roman, Marlena, Jack, and his daughter Cassie were not saved. They were in the clutches of Tony DiMera once again, and he took them to a remote European castle where he held them captive.\n\nWhile in the castle, Tony DiMera (actually Andre DiMera) tormented Roman and Marlena with video of John and Kate growing ever closer back in Salem. Eventually, they believed the two of them had sex, and Roman and Marlena, needing comfort, had sex as well. Shortly thereafter, Jack made his way into their room. They escaped! Through fire and explosions, our group of intrepid Salemites \u2013 Marlena, Roman, Jack and Cassie \u2013 all got out and were on their way home.\n\nOn the ISA jet on the way back to Salem, Roman and Marlena made the decision to not tell Kate and John that they had sex. Marlena was uncomfortable with lying to John, but eventually agreed with Roman. When they arrived back they were shocked to learn that John and Kate had fallen in love and were engaged to be married, but Roman and Marlena still didn't tell the truth about their affair. Soon after they were back Marlena discovered that she was pregnant and that Roman had to be the father, but when the truth came out John wasn't too forgiving. During a fight between Roman and John, Marlena tumbled down the stairs, causing a miscarriage.\n\n===2010s===\nAs the second decade of the 21st century has unfolded, Roman is the commissioner of the Salem police force. After an ill-fated marriage to Kate Roberts, he has remained single and adopted an elder-statesman, back-burner role on the show. He serves primarily as the de facto patriarch of the Brady family and the supervisor and occasional voice-of-reason to junior police officers and ISA agents (with a [[catchphrase]] of sorts developing from his consistent inquiries of \"what da hell\" is going on). He has largely made peace with his past with [[Stefano DiMera]], [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]], and [[Victor Kiriakis]], and remains friends with ex-wives Anna DiMera, [[Marlena Evans]], and Kate Roberts, and is occasionally shown as having a soft spot for all of them. In March 2017 he retired as police commissioner and was seen in a later episode tending bar at the Brady Pub. In 2018 he began working with his friends John Black and Steve Johnson at their private detective business, Black Patch.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/roman.php Roman at '''soap'''central.'''com''']\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brady, Roman}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional police captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional American police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional police commissioners]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character from Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Days of our Lives\n| image1 = File:joshasroman.jpg\n| caption1 = Josh Taylor as Roman Brady\n| image2 = File:DOOLNorthrop-Roman.jpg\n| caption2 = Wayne Northrop as Roman Brady\n| image3 = File:Drake_Hogestyn_as_Roman.jpg\n| caption3 = Drake Hogestyn as [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|\"Roman\"]]\n| name = Roman Brady\n| portrayer = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Wayne Northrop]] (1981\u201384, 1991\u201394)\n* [[Josh Taylor (actor)|Josh Taylor]] (1997\u2013) \n}} \n| creator = [[Pat Falken Smith]]\n| introducer = [[Betty Corday]] and [[Al Rabin]]\n| years = {{Flat list |\n*1981\u201384\n*1991\u201394\n*1997\u2013\n}}\n| first = {{start date|1981|12|08}}\n| last = \n| appeared = <!-- for an episode date if the episode is unnamed -->\n| only = <!-- for an episode title or season -->\n| classification = [[Days of Our Lives cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| books = \n| spinoffs = \n| alias = \n| occupation = Police commissioner (retired)\n| home = [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]], [[United States|Illinois]]\n| family = Brady family\n| spouse= {{ubl|[[Anna DiMera|Anna Brady]] (until 1982)|[[Marlena Evans]] (1983\u201394)|[[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] (2003\u201305)}}\n| husband= \n| parents= {{ubl|[[Shawn Brady]]|[[Caroline Brady]]}}\n| brothers = {{ubl|[[Frankie Brady]] (adoptive)|[[Max Brady]] (adoptive)}}\n| sisters = {{ubl|[[Kimberly Brady]]|[[Kayla Brady]]}}\n| halfbrothers = [[Bo Brady]]\n| sons = {{ubl|[[Eric Brady]]|[[Rex Brady]]}}\n| daughters = {{ubl|[[Carrie Brady]]|[[Sami Brady]]|[[Cassie Brady]]}}\n| grandsons = {{ubl|[[Will Horton]]|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Johnny DiMera|Johnny DiMera]]|Noah Reed}}\n| granddaughters = {{ubl|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Allie Horton|Allie Horton]]|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Sydney DiMera|Sydney DiMera]]}}Emily Lockhart <br> Mackenzie Horton \n| grandparents= Peter Brady\n| aunts/uncles= Eric Brady<br>[[Colleen Brady]] <br> Molly Murphy \n| cousins= Ryan Brady <br> [[Colin Murphy (Days of our Lives)|Colin Murphy]] \n| nieces/nephews= Andrew Donovan <br> [[Theresa Donovan]] <br> [[Stephanie Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Stephanie Johnson]] <br> [[Joey Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Joey Johnson]] <br> [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]] <br> [[Chelsea Brady]] <br> [[Zack Brady]] <br> [[Ciara Brady]]\n}}\n'''Roman Brady''' is a [[fictional character]] from the long-running [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.

Northrop was later recast as another new character, [[Alex North (fiction)|Dr. Alex North]], and scenes from Northrop's time playing Roman were edited to create the new character's backstory.\n\n==Characterization==\nRoman is the retired police commissioner of the fictional Midwestern town of [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]], and currently manages and tends bar at his family's business, the Brady Pub. He is also a former agent of the fictional [[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|International Security Alliance]] (ISA), a spy agency focused on all sorts of unusually high-level global conspiracies that tended to center around his otherwise-quiet home town. During his portrayal by Northrop, he was established as a top-notch cop but also a bit of a renegade, often accepting deep-cover assignments, and a master of disguise (similar to Sherlock Holmes). Hogestyn's character was more by-the-book on the job, although still dangerous with a dark side somewhat characteristic of an ex-spy (which later fed into the \"John Black\" persona), with expertise in [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Jeet Kune Do]], and a little more of a ladies' man. Taylor's portrayal is more that of a \"regular guy\", with a bit less intrigue and more straightforward professionally, although still with an eye for the ladies and more inclined to engage in [[one night stand|one-night stands]] with various women than the character as portrayed by Northrop or Hogestyn (such as with Kate Roberts, Billie Reed, ex-wives Anna DiMera and Marlena Evans, and a strongly hinted at \u2013 but never confirmed \u2013 rendezvous with Nicole Walker).\n\nOver the years, much has been made of the creation (and constant [[retcon]] of the backstory) of [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn's]] character John Black as an entirely separate character than that of Roman Brady, especially after the show had invested over five years in establishing John's identity as Roman, complete with a plausible backstory of his \u201ctime away\u201d (while he was being held captive, brainwashed, and trained\u2014-unsuccessfully\u2014-to be an assassin by Stefano DiMera), and \"Roman's\" reemerging memories. However, with Roman's recasts and changes in characterization over the years (while John has consistently been played by Hogestyn), in hindsight it can be said that it was actually John Black that remained more true to the original \"Roman\" persona, and that it was Roman that was gradually developed into a separate character. This was especially illustrated in 2016 when Roman, who had always been a straight-shooter with regard to the law, became complicit in the cover-up of sister-in-law [[Hope Brady]]'s murder of [[Stefano DiMera]], who she wrongly believed was responsible for the disappearance and later death of her husband (and Roman's brother) [[Bo Brady]].\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===1981\u201384===\nRoman Brady first appeared on Days to protect Marlena Evans from a serial killer.<ref>Days of Our Lives Episode dated January 8, 1982</ref> He slept on her floor. The chemistry between the actors, and the characters, led to love. In 1983 on Days of Our Lives, Roman and Marlena were married. Over the next year Roman became embroiled in a storyline with Stefano DiMera. Stefano was a powerful and ruthless business tycoon (and organized crime figure) from Europe who had come to town to set up shop in Salem, and Roman being the city's top cop had gone after him. Subsequently Stefano framed Roman for serial killings that were being committed by his nephew Andre DiMera. At the time Marlena saw Roman killing a woman. Later it was shown that Andre had used a realistic mask. Roman was jailed. Mrs. Alice Horton baked him some drugged doughnuts, and on the way to the hospital Roman escaped. He went on the run to prove his innocence, and he accomplished that. He was promoted, and Stefano was on the run.\n\nIn November 1984 Roman tracked Stefano to a Caribbean island where many other characters had crash-landed, too. Stefano was suffering from incurable cancer, and needed to collect three mysterious prisms to unlock a secret formula to cure himself. Roman caught up to him on a cliff, but Stefano pulled a gun. He shot Roman, who seemingly fell to his death. His brother Bo cradled him in his arms on the beach, but had to leave him for a few minutes. When he returned the body was gone. Bo assumed that while he was away, the tide had come in and washed Roman\u2019s body out to sea, for which Bo blamed himself for years. Several episodes later Roman was shown aboard Stefano's yacht, motionless.\n\n===1986\u20131990===\n:{{main|John Black (Days of our Lives)}}\nIn 1986 an amnesiac known only as \"The Pawn\" appeared in Salem on January 23, 1986.<ref>Lucille Giordano, Inside Days of Our Lives July 1995.</ref> He assumed the name \"John Black\" after reading it on a Vietnam War memorial in Salem. Eventually the character was revealed to be Roman Brady having undergone extensive plastic surgery, brainwashing, and martial arts training (purportedly to be trained as an assassin) by Stefano DiMera. After an uneasy \"re-introduction\" to his family and friends in Salem, the character resumed his life as Roman.\n\nIn 1988, a storyline featuring a reappearance by Stefano (who had been believed dead) focused on what had happened to Roman during his time in captivity (1984\u20131986). Roman and loved ones traveled back to the Caribbean island where Roman had \"died\" in 1984, and it was revealed that the ISA knew all along that Roman was being held by Stefano and being trained via brainwashing, and extensive instruction by a martial arts master named Orion Hawk, to be one of Stefano's assassins. In fact, the ISA unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate Orion's training camp to extract Roman, but this failed due to the high level of security at Stefano's compound as well as Roman's brainwashed state. This tied into the introduction of [[Benjy Hawk|Benjy]], Stefano's son (and Orion's grandson) who was fostered for a while by [[Steve Johnson (Days of our Lives)|Steve]] and [[Kayla Johnson]]. Although subtle hints pointed to the possibility of this \"Roman\" turning out to be someone else, abetted by speculation by fans and by [[Drake Hogestyn|Hogestyn]] himself, the clues seemed to tie back together with the resolution that, at least for the moment, the character portrayed by Hogestyn was in fact Roman Brady.\n\n===1991\u201394===\nAfter believing that Roman's wife, Marlena Evans, had been dead for some years, he had fallen in love with a woman named [[Isabella Toscano]]. In 1991 Marlena turns up alive. In August 1991 the character who had been presumed as Roman Brady since 1986 is retroactively revealed to be a separate character (now once again called John Black) who was brainwashed to believe he was Roman, when what would now be the real Roman (once again played by Wayne Northrop) was found on an island where he had been imprisoned by Stefano. Roman was shocked when he found he had been replaced and all his family had accepted John Black as him and John Black had a difficult time accepting he was not really Roman. Roman went back to his life, and he and Marlena tried to live once again as man and wife. After the death of Isabella, in his grief John turned to Marlena for comfort. The two found themselves unable to resolve their feelings for each other from their life together when John believed himself to be Roman. He and Marlena had an affair that resulted in the birth of a daughter, [[Belle Black|Isabella]], named after [[Isabella Toscano]], whom Roman believed to be his own daughter. When he discovered that Marlena and John had an affair and that Belle was not his real daughter, Roman was crushed. In June 1994, Roman leaves town broken and bitter, once again with no family.<ref>{{cite episode|series= Days Of Our Lives |series-link= Days of Our Lives |number = 7304|network=[[NBC]]|credits= [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] ([[Executive producer]]s); [[James E.

The cure to his ailment was discovered by John, Hope, and Stefano in a jungle mission that was engineered to drive John and Marlena apart, but in the end had the opposite result.\n\nRoman was \"killed\" during the Salem Stalker Murders in December 2003 during his wedding reception to Kate Roberts, but again was revealed to not really be dead. He lived on the island of Melaswen (New Salem) with every other victim from the Salem Stalker Murders, including Marlena. Eventually, other Salemites arrived on the island, trying to find their \"dead\" loved ones. Some of them went out in the jungle, looking for a way off the island, while the rest remained in \"Salem\" waiting for help. Help finally arrived.

It is primarily set in the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. ''Outbreak''{{'s}} plot speculates how far military and civilian agencies might go to contain the spread of a deadly, contagious disease.\n\nThe film, released on March 10, 1995, was a box-office success and Spacey won two awards for his performance. A real-life outbreak of the Ebola virus was occurring in Zaire when the film was released.<ref name=CDC/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be no less and no more than 400\u2013700 words. -->\n{{cquote|The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance on the planet is the virus.|author=[[Joshua Lederberg]], Ph.D., Nobel laureate |source=Film introduction: \"Outbreak\" (1995)}}<br />\nIn 1967, during the [[Kisangani Mutinies]], a virus called Motaba, which causes a [[viral hemorrhagic fever|deadly fever]], is discovered in the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|African]] jungle. To keep the virus a secret, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers Donald McClintock and Billy Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected. \n\nTwenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] virologist, is sent to investigate an outbreak in [[Zaire]]. He and his crew\u2014Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt\u2014gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general and Daniels' superior officer, dismisses the latter's fears that the virus will spread.\n\nBetsy, a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey that is host to the virus, is smuggled into the country. James \"Jimbo\" Scott, a worker at an [[animal testing]] laboratory, is infected when he steals Betsy to sell on the [[black market]]. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez (who also becomes infected), a pet-store owner in the coastal-[[California]] village of Cedar Creek. After releasing the monkey in the woods outside of the nearby community of Palisades, he develops symptoms on a flight to [[Boston]] and infects his girlfriend, Alice. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientist and Daniels' ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected.\n\nA hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy's blood. The virus quickly mutates into a strain capable of spreading like [[influenza]], becoming airborne and causing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes [[martial law]]. Schuler is infected when his suit tears and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle while treating him.\n\nWhen Ford provides an experimental serum which cures the original strain, Daniels realizes that he was aware of the virus before the outbreak. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek, incinerating the town and its residents, ostensibly to prevent Motaba's expansion to pandemic proportions. However, McClintock, now a major general, plans to use the operation to conceal the virus's existence so it can be preserved for use as a [[biological weapon]].\n\nTo prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes before he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship at sea which carried Betsy. Daniels obtains a picture of Betsy and releases it to the media; a Palisades resident, Mrs. Jeffries, realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with Betsy in their yard and calls the CDC. Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries' house where Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding in the woods nearby. When he learns from Daniels about Betsy's capture, Ford delays the bombing.\n\nOn their return flight, Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter. Salt fires two rockets into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed. Once back in Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy's [[antibody|antibodies]] with Ford's serum to create an [[antiserum]]; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly their helicopter directly into the path of the bomber's approach to its target. \n\nWith Ford's help, Daniels persuades the bomber's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest.

film|disaster]] film directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and based on [[Richard Preston]]'s nonfiction book ''[[The Hot Zone]]''.<ref name=Walton2004/> The film stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Donald Sutherland]], and co-stars [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]].\n\nThe film focuses on an outbreak of a fictional [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]]-like Motaba virus, in [[Zaire]] and later in a small town in the United States. It is primarily set in the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. ''Outbreak''{{'s}} plot speculates how far military and civilian agencies might go to contain the spread of a deadly, contagious disease.\n\nThe film, released on March 10, 1995, was a box-office success and Spacey won two awards for his performance. A real-life outbreak of the Ebola virus was occurring in Zaire when the film was released.<ref name=CDC/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be no less and no more than 400\u2013700 words. -->\n{{cquote|The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance on the planet is the virus.|author=[[Joshua Lederberg]], Ph.D., Nobel laureate |source=Film introduction: \"Outbreak\" (1995)}}<br />\nIn 1967, during the [[Kisangani Mutinies]], a virus called Motaba, which causes a [[viral hemorrhagic fever|deadly fever]], is discovered in the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|African]] jungle. To keep the virus a secret, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers Donald McClintock and Billy Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected. \n\nTwenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] virologist, is sent to investigate an outbreak in [[Zaire]]. He and his crew\u2014Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt\u2014gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general and Daniels' superior officer, dismisses the latter's fears that the virus will spread.\n\nBetsy, a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey that is host to the virus, is smuggled into the country. James \"Jimbo\" Scott, a worker at an [[animal testing]] laboratory, is infected when he steals Betsy to sell on the [[black market]]. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez (who also becomes infected), a pet-store owner in the coastal-[[California]] village of Cedar Creek. After releasing the monkey in the woods outside of the nearby community of Palisades, he develops symptoms on a flight to [[Boston]] and infects his girlfriend, Alice. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientist and Daniels' ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected.\n\nA hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy's blood. The virus quickly mutates into a strain capable of spreading like [[influenza]], becoming airborne and causing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes [[martial law]]. Schuler is infected when his suit tears and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle while treating him.\n\nWhen Ford provides an experimental serum which cures the original strain, Daniels realizes that he was aware of the virus before the outbreak. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek, incinerating the town and its residents, ostensibly to prevent Motaba's expansion to pandemic proportions. However, McClintock, now a major general, plans to use the operation to conceal the virus's existence so it can be preserved for use as a [[biological weapon]].\n\nTo prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes before he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship at sea which carried Betsy. Daniels obtains a picture of Betsy and releases it to the media; a Palisades resident, Mrs. Jeffries, realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with Betsy in their yard and calls the CDC. Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries' house where Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding in the woods nearby. When he learns from Daniels about Betsy's capture, Ford delays the bombing.\n\nOn their return flight, Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter. Salt fires two rockets into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed. Once back in Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy's [[antibody|antibodies]] with Ford's serum to create an [[antiserum]]; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly their helicopter directly into the path of the bomber's approach to its target. \n\nWith Ford's help, Daniels persuades the bomber's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest. Daniels and Keough reconcile as Cedar Creek's residents are cured.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Colonel Sam Daniels, MD\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Dr. Roberta \"Robby\" Keough, MD\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Brigadier General Billy Ford, MD\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Major General Donald \"Donnie\" McClintock\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler, MD\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Major Salt, MD\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as James \"Jimbo\" Scott\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Dr. Benjamin Iwabi\n* Malick Bowens as Dr. Raswani\n* [[Susan Lee Hoffman]] as Dr. Lisa Aronson\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Dr. Julio Ruiz\n* [[Bruce Jarchow]] as Dr. Mascelli\n* Leland Hayward III as Henry Seward\n* Daniel Chodos as Rudy Alvarez\n* [[Dale Dye]] as Lieutenant Colonel Briggs\n* Kara Keough as Kate Jeffries\n* Gina Menza as Mrs. Jeffries\n* Per Didrik Fasmer as Mr. Jeffries\n* [[Maury Sterling]] as Sandman One\n* Michael Emanuel as Sandman One co-pilot\n* Kellie Overbey as Alice\n* [[J.

The statistics are hierarchically ordered in a navigation tree. Tables are distinguished from multi-dimensional datasets from which the statistics are extracted via an interactive tool.\n\nIn addition various printed publications are available either in electronic form free on the internet or in printed form via the EU Bookshop.
