Bonney ([[Billy the Kid]]) in the 1960\u201362 [[NBC]] [[television series]] ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'' and as Emmett Ryker in another NBC [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.\n\nGulager's first major film role was in [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964), followed by a supporting part in the racing film ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' (1969) opposite [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]]; in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s drama ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971); and opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[McQ]]'' (1974). In the 1980s, Gulager appeared in several horror films, such as ''[[The Initiation (film)|The Initiation]]'' (1984) and the zombie comedy ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' (1985). In 2005, he appeared in the horror film ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]'', as well as its sequels. He also appeared in the independent film ''[[Tangerine (film)|Tangerine]]'' (2015).\n\nGulager directed the short film ''A Day with the Boys'', which was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] for Best Short Film at the 1969 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Early life==\nGulager was born in [[Holdenville, Oklahoma]], the son of John Delancy Gulager, who had been an actor before settling down to practice law in nearby [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]].<ref name=\"EOHC-CluGulager\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU002 Michener, Judith \"Gulager, William Martin (1928 &ndash; ),\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'']; accessed August 25, 2016.</ref>{{efn|One source described John Gulager as a [[cowboy]] entertainer.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Clu-Gulager.html Clu Gulager Biography], filmreference.com; accessed September 2, 2018.</ref>}} His paternal grandmother, Martha Schrimsher Gulager, was a sister of Mary Scrimshaw, the mother of [[Will Rogers]], making Gulager and Rogers first cousins, once removed.<ref name=\"EOHC-CluGulager\"/><ref>[http://www.psychotronicvideo.com/wow/inner_views/gulager/gulager.html \"Clu\" Gulager profile], www.psychotronicvideo.com; accessed February 12, 2019.</ref> He has [[Cherokee Indian]] [[ancestry]].<ref name=Conley>Conley, Robert J.

In 1952, he returned to Baylor. In 1960, he married fellow actor [[Miriam Byrd Nethery]], an [[Arkansas|Arkansan]].

In the spring of 1959, Gulager appeared as Tommy Pavlock in the episode \"The Immigrant\" of NBC's series ''[[The Lawless Years]]'', a 1920s crime drama. In the fall of 1959, he appeared in the episode \"The Temple of the Swinging Doll\" of NBC's short-lived espionage drama ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'', starring [[David Hedison]].<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/utah/provo/provo-daily-herald/1967/01-23/page-21|title=Clu Gulager was insecure once, but not uncertain|publisher=Provo Daily Herald|date=January 23, 1967|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 3, 1959, he guest-starred as the unscrupulous photographer Elliott Garrison in \"The Andrew Hale Story\" on NBC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. On October 11, 1959, Gulager appeared as a [[U.S. Navy]] sailor in the \"Appointment at Eleven\" episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and again as an escaped convict in \"Pen Pal\" on November 1, 1960. On ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', he played the role of real-life vicious mob killer [[Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll]]. Gulager was hailed for his utterly chilling performance as the psychopathic Coll. Late in 1959, he was cast as Beau Chandler in the episode \"Jessie Quinn\" of the NBC Western series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. The episode is a tale of intrigue involving the [[Texas Revolution]]. Capt. Holden attempts to send weapons to [[Sam Houston]], but forces of [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] in [[Mexico]] threaten to blow up Holden's vessel, the ''Enterprise''.\n[[File:Clu Gulager Marianna Hill The Tall Man.JPG|thumb|220px|Gulager as Billy the Kid with [[Marianna Hill]] as his sweetheart, Rita, from the television program ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]''.]]\nFrom 1960-62, Gulager played Billy the Kid in ''The Tall Man'' opposite [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]]. The episodes portray Billy as a sympathetic character without resorting to the \"misunderstood young man\" theme used in such films as ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]''. In 1961, Gulager guest-starred in another NBC Western, ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]'', [[Audie Murphy]]'s only attempt at series television. Gulager portrayed Deputy Sheriff Emmett Ryker from 1964 to 1968 on ''The Virginian,'' the 90-minute Western series in which he starred with [[James Drury]], [[Doug McClure]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Roberta Shore]], [[Randy Boone]], [[Gary Clarke]], and [[Diane Roter]]. Gulager appeared more than 60 times in other roles in film and television, including the film ''Winning'' and the CBS series ''[[Three for the Road (TV series)|Three for the Road]]''. He also appeared several times on NBC's ''[[Bonanza]]''. He starred with [[Lee Marvin]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[John Cassavetes]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in ''The Killers'', teaming with Marvin as a pair of ruthless hit men.\n\nGulager appeared notably in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971). In 1977, long after his role on ''The Virginian'', he appeared in [[Rod Taylor]]'s unsuccessful NBC Western series, ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', in the episode \"The Army Deserter\". Gulager also played the boss of [[Susan Sarandon]] in a 1977 film drama, ''[[The Other Side of Midnight (film)|The Other Side of Midnight]]''. In 1981, he co-starred opposite [[Oscar Award]]-winner [[Jane Wyman]], along with some newer younger actors [[Lorenzo Lamas]], [[William R. Moses]], and [[Jamie Rose]], in the pilot episode of ''The Vintage Years'' (which was retooled as the primetime soap opera: ''[[Falcon Crest]]'') for the male lead role of Angela Channing's long-suffering nephew, Chase Gioberti, when he was not rehired to continue with his role, hence, [[Robert Foxworth]], took over the role, until his firing in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falconcrest.org/english/master.php?path=show/episodes/ai/bts/tvy|title=www.falconcrest.org - Deutscher FALCON CREST - Fanclub / German FALCON CREST Fan Club|website=www.falconcrest.org}}</ref> He also appeared in his son John Gulager's ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]'' series of films as a shotgun-toting bartender, and had a role in the 2012 film ''[[Piranha 3DD]]''. He was also a featured player in director [[John Landis]]' darkly comedic 1985 film noir satire, ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into The Night]]'', a film rife with insider Hollywood cameos, as an FBI agent, courier of a cache of clandestine funds, which he grudgingly delivers to secure the safety of the film's two romantic leads ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]]). In an example of the film's dry humor, their characters find they are not in a position to object as the agent/courier (Gulager) angrily pilfers as many packets of bills from the treasure trove as he can resentfully stuff into his pockets in plain sight of them, before leaving the bewildered pair in a huff.\n\nHe was cast as Burt Wilson in the [[Dan O'Bannon]]-directed 1985 cult classic, ''The Return of the Living Dead''. In 2005, Gulager appeared in ''Feast'', followed by the film's two sequels, ''[[Feast II: Sloppy Seconds]]'' (2008), and ''[[Feast III: The Happy Finish]]'' (2009), all of which were directed by his son, John. He also had a minor role in the critically acclaimed independent film ''Tangerine'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/tangerine-unlikely-hit-of-the-year|work=Vogue|title=Why Tangerine Is the Most Unlikely Hit of the Year|author=Powers, John|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He first became known for his work in television, appearing in the co-starring role of William H. Bonney ([[Billy the Kid]]) in the 1960\u201362 [[NBC]] [[television series]] ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'' and as Emmett Ryker in another NBC [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.\n\nGulager's first major film role was in [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964), followed by a supporting part in the racing film ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' (1969) opposite [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]]; in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s drama ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971); and opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[McQ]]'' (1974). In the 1980s, Gulager appeared in several horror films, such as ''[[The Initiation (film)|The Initiation]]'' (1984) and the zombie comedy ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' (1985). In 2005, he appeared in the horror film ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]'', as well as its sequels. He also appeared in the independent film ''[[Tangerine (film)|Tangerine]]'' (2015).\n\nGulager directed the short film ''A Day with the Boys'', which was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] for Best Short Film at the 1969 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Early life==\nGulager was born in [[Holdenville, Oklahoma]], the son of John Delancy Gulager, who had been an actor before settling down to practice law in nearby [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]].<ref name=\"EOHC-CluGulager\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU002 Michener, Judith \"Gulager, William Martin (1928 &ndash; ),\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'']; accessed August 25, 2016.</ref>{{efn|One source described John Gulager as a [[cowboy]] entertainer.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Clu-Gulager.html Clu Gulager Biography], filmreference.com; accessed September 2, 2018.</ref>}} His paternal grandmother, Martha Schrimsher Gulager, was a sister of Mary Scrimshaw, the mother of [[Will Rogers]], making Gulager and Rogers first cousins, once removed.<ref name=\"EOHC-CluGulager\"/><ref>[http://www.psychotronicvideo.com/wow/inner_views/gulager/gulager.html \"Clu\" Gulager profile], www.psychotronicvideo.com; accessed February 12, 2019.</ref> He has [[Cherokee Indian]] [[ancestry]].<ref name=Conley>Conley, Robert J.

In 1952, he returned to Baylor. In 1960, he married fellow actor [[Miriam Byrd Nethery]], an [[Arkansas|Arkansan]]. The couple had two sons, including film director [[John Gulager]], and remained married until her death in 2003.<ref name=\"EOHC-CluGulager\"/>\n\n==Career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\nIn 1958, Gulager appeared as Roy Carter in the episode \"The Return of Roy Carter\" (written by [[Gene Roddenberry]], creator of ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the Western television series ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' starring [[Richard Boone]]. In the spring of 1959, Gulager appeared as Tommy Pavlock in the episode \"The Immigrant\" of NBC's series ''[[The Lawless Years]]'', a 1920s crime drama. In the fall of 1959, he appeared in the episode \"The Temple of the Swinging Doll\" of NBC's short-lived espionage drama ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'', starring [[David Hedison]].<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/utah/provo/provo-daily-herald/1967/01-23/page-21|title=Clu Gulager was insecure once, but not uncertain|publisher=Provo Daily Herald|date=January 23, 1967|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 3, 1959, he guest-starred as the unscrupulous photographer Elliott Garrison in \"The Andrew Hale Story\" on NBC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. On October 11, 1959, Gulager appeared as a [[U.S. Navy]] sailor in the \"Appointment at Eleven\" episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and again as an escaped convict in \"Pen Pal\" on November 1, 1960. On ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', he played the role of real-life vicious mob killer [[Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll]]. Gulager was hailed for his utterly chilling performance as the psychopathic Coll. Late in 1959, he was cast as Beau Chandler in the episode \"Jessie Quinn\" of the NBC Western series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. The episode is a tale of intrigue involving the [[Texas Revolution]]. Capt. Holden attempts to send weapons to [[Sam Houston]], but forces of [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] in [[Mexico]] threaten to blow up Holden's vessel, the ''Enterprise''.\n[[File:Clu Gulager Marianna Hill The Tall Man.JPG|thumb|220px|Gulager as Billy the Kid with [[Marianna Hill]] as his sweetheart, Rita, from the television program ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]''.]]\nFrom 1960-62, Gulager played Billy the Kid in ''The Tall Man'' opposite [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]]. The episodes portray Billy as a sympathetic character without resorting to the \"misunderstood young man\" theme used in such films as ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]''. In 1961, Gulager guest-starred in another NBC Western, ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]'', [[Audie Murphy]]'s only attempt at series television. Gulager portrayed Deputy Sheriff Emmett Ryker from 1964 to 1968 on ''The Virginian,'' the 90-minute Western series in which he starred with [[James Drury]], [[Doug McClure]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Roberta Shore]], [[Randy Boone]], [[Gary Clarke]], and [[Diane Roter]]. Gulager appeared more than 60 times in other roles in film and television, including the film ''Winning'' and the CBS series ''[[Three for the Road (TV series)|Three for the Road]]''. He also appeared several times on NBC's ''[[Bonanza]]''. He starred with [[Lee Marvin]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[John Cassavetes]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in ''The Killers'', teaming with Marvin as a pair of ruthless hit men.\n\nGulager appeared notably in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971). In 1977, long after his role on ''The Virginian'', he appeared in [[Rod Taylor]]'s unsuccessful NBC Western series, ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', in the episode \"The Army Deserter\". Gulager also played the boss of [[Susan Sarandon]] in a 1977 film drama, ''[[The Other Side of Midnight (film)|The Other Side of Midnight]]''. In 1981, he co-starred opposite [[Oscar Award]]-winner [[Jane Wyman]], along with some newer younger actors [[Lorenzo Lamas]], [[William R. Moses]], and [[Jamie Rose]], in the pilot episode of ''The Vintage Years'' (which was retooled as the primetime soap opera: ''[[Falcon Crest]]'') for the male lead role of Angela Channing's long-suffering nephew, Chase Gioberti, when he was not rehired to continue with his role, hence, [[Robert Foxworth]], took over the role, until his firing in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falconcrest.org/english/master.php?path=show/episodes/ai/bts/tvy|title=www.falconcrest.org - Deutscher FALCON CREST - Fanclub / German FALCON CREST Fan Club|website=www.falconcrest.org}}</ref> He also appeared in his son John Gulager's ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]'' series of films as a shotgun-toting bartender, and had a role in the 2012 film ''[[Piranha 3DD]]''. He was also a featured player in director [[John Landis]]' darkly comedic 1985 film noir satire, ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into The Night]]'', a film rife with insider Hollywood cameos, as an FBI agent, courier of a cache of clandestine funds, which he grudgingly delivers to secure the safety of the film's two romantic leads ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]]). In an example of the film's dry humor, their characters find they are not in a position to object as the agent/courier (Gulager) angrily pilfers as many packets of bills from the treasure trove as he can resentfully stuff into his pockets in plain sight of them, before leaving the bewildered pair in a huff.\n\nHe was cast as Burt Wilson in the [[Dan O'Bannon]]-directed 1985 cult classic, ''The Return of the Living Dead''. In 2005, Gulager appeared in ''Feast'', followed by the film's two sequels, ''[[Feast II: Sloppy Seconds]]'' (2008), and ''[[Feast III: The Happy Finish]]'' (2009), all of which were directed by his son, John. He also had a minor role in the critically acclaimed independent film ''Tangerine'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/tangerine-unlikely-hit-of-the-year|work=Vogue|title=Why Tangerine Is the Most Unlikely Hit of the Year|author=Powers, John|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In 1981, the [[Fryske Akademy]] (Frisian Academy) published a dictionary of the language, then still seen as a [[dialect]] (Hylper Wurdboek, 1981, author: Gosse Blom). In 2006 they started developing a new dictionary which was completed in 2019 (Graet Hylper Wordebook, authors: Gosse Blom, Sybren Dyk, assisted by Wiebe Zoethout).

Why is Hylpers considered a language instead of a dialect? According to Dyami Millarson (the person responsible for getting Hylpers, along with [[Skylgersk]] and [[Terschelling Frisian]], in the Glottolog) \"These 3 languages have a complete language system, it's not just a few words which are different from Frisian, the languages have developed separately from Frisian.

Because of this, Hindeloopen Frisian underwent greater influence from Hollandic speech than the other dialects of West Frisian. The location of Hindeloopen is, however, not a complete explanation for the dialect: until about 1800, [[Koudum]] had a dialect that was very similar to Hindeloopen.\n\n==Differences with Standard West Frisian==\n*In Hindeloopen Frisian, the ''l'' in the trigraphs ''\u00e2ld'' and ''\u00e2lt'' is not silent, as it is in Standard West Frisian, and the vowel is longer. \n*The Standard West Frisian ''tsj'' is reduced to ''tj'' or ''s''; for example, ''tjian'' for the standard ''tsjin'' (against) and ''serke'' for the standard ''tsjerke'' (church).\n*The digraph ''[[ae (digraph)|ae]]'' is still used instead of the modern ''[[aa (digraph)|aa]]''.\n*The standard ''\u00fa'' is written ''uu''.\n*Non-standard letters used: ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'', ''\u00e8'' and ''\u00f2''. \n\nThere are also a few lexical differences, such as ''siie'' instead of ''naaie'' (to sew), ''t\u00e4t'' instead of ''happe'' (a child\u2019s word for \u201chorse\u201d) and ''\u00f6ie'' instead of ''sipel'' (onion). The dialect\u2019s vocabulary preserves many more words from Old Frisian that are no longer used elsewhere.\nThe differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between Hindeloopen Frisian and Standard West Frisian are so big that mutual intelligibility is difficult.
