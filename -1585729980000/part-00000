He won the [[South American Footballer of the Year]] award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]].

One of the most recognisable players in the league at the time of its inception, he helped popularise the league during the second half of the 1990s. To this day, he is an icon and is considered one of the most decorated players to ever play in MLS; in 2005, he was named to the [[MLS All-Time Best XI]].<ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2012/m=4/news=colombian-flavour-the-rise-mls-1614638.html|title=Colombian flavour on the rise in MLS|publisher=FIFA.com|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mlssoccer1\">[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/08/colombians-mls-stability-status-influence-recent-shift Colombians in MLS: Stability, status influence recent shift | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/mls-colombia-colombians-portland-timbers-diego-chara Why are so many Colombians keen to play in MLS? | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2010/10/19/2172421/colombia-makes-an-impact-on-major-league-soccer Colombia Makes An Impact On Major League Soccer - Goal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1614638.html</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Colombia and Europe===\nBorn in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]], Valderrama began his career at [[Uni\u00f3n Magdalena]] of the Colombian First Division in 1981. He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]]. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], and subsequently [[Atl\u00e9tico Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===MLS career===\n[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]\nValderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons. He returned to Tampa Bay in 2000, spending two more seasons with the club; while a member of the Mutiny, the team would sell Carlos Valderrama wigs at [[Tampa Stadium]].<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/> In the [[2000 MLS season]], Valderrama recorded the only 20+ assist season in MLS history\u2014ending the season with 26 \u2014 a single season assist record that remains intact to this day, and which MLS itself suggested was an \"unbreakable\" record in a 2012 article.<ref name=unbreakable>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2012/06/22/power-5-unbreakable-records-valderramas-26-assists-2000 Power 5 Unbreakable Records - Valderrama's 26 assists in 2000 | MLSsoccer.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2001, Valderrama joined the [[Colorado Rapids]], and remained with the team until 2002, when he retired; his American soccer league career spanned a total of eight years, during which he made 175 appearances.

In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n[[File:Valderrama colombia 1993.jpg|thumb|120px|Valderrama with Colombia in 1993]]\nSome of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2\u20130 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however, needing at least a draw against the eventual champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1\u20131 draw.

His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2\u20130 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nAlthough Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense. Although he often wore the number 10 shirt throughout his career and was deployed as an attacking midfielder at times, he played mostly in deeper positions in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]] of the pitch \u2013 often operating in a free role as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]], rather than in [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|more advanced midfield positions]] behind the forwards \u2013 in order to have a greater influence on the game.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/> A team-player, Valderrama was also known to be an extremely selfless [[midfielder]], who preferred assisting his teammates over going for goal himself;<ref name=\"mlssoccer1\"/><ref name=dios>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/columnista0.asp|title=\"El Pibe, un peque\u00f1o dios\"|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez V.|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\">{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|location=New Orleans|isbn=9780977668809|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&pg=PA166&dq=carlos+valderrama+colombia&hl=it&ei=ZlIeTPGzONiS4gbty6CeDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=carlos%20valderrama%20colombia&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collie|first1=Ashley Jude|title=World of Soccer: A Complete Guide to the World's Most Popular Sport|date=2005|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0823936988|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgrsn7ybvNoC&pg=PA63&dq=%22carlos+valderrama%22&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=17#v=onepage&q=%22carlos%20valderrama%22&f=false}}</ref> his tactical intelligence, positioning, efficient movement and versatile range of passing enabled him to both set the tempo of his team in midfield with short, first time exchanges, or create chances with long lobbed passes or through balls.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca\">[http://chihasbagliatopagliuca.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-maturana-changed-football.html Chi ha sbagliato Pagliuca?: How Maturana changed football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube1\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyBzAYFg8E Valderrama 1990/1991 French D1 (assists) part2 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\">{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col1.asp|title=Diez veces gracias|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=Jaime Bernal|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2006/m=2/news=carlos-valderrama-all-again-102983.html|title=Carlos Valderrama: I'd do it all again|publisher=FIFA.com|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nValderrama's most instantly recognisable physical features were his big afro-blonde hairstyle, jewelry, and moustache,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> but he was best known for his grace and elegance on the ball, as well as his agility, and quick feet as a footballer. His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, often with elaborate skills, which made him an extremely popular figure with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"Colombia aren't creative enough\"/><ref name=\"Boots and a bouffant\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube2\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube3\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El m\u00e1s querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a \"languid\" playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=dios/><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\"/><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\"/> Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"prestigio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=\"No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio\"|publisher=El Gr\u00e1fico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nFormer French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, \"In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease.

He also later played for [[Millonarios]] in 1984. He joined [[Deportivo Cali]] in 1985, where he played most of his Colombian football. In 1988, he moved to the [[Ligue 1|French First Division]] side [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]]. He struggled to adapt to the less technical and the faster, more physical, and tactical brand of football being played in Europe, losing his place in the squad. However, his passing ability later saw him become the club's main creative force, and he played a decisive role as his side won the [[Coupe de France]] in [[1990 Coupe de France Final|1990]]. In 1991, he remained in Europe and joined Spanish side [[Real Valladolid]] for a season. He then returned to Colombia in 1992 and went on to play for [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], and subsequently [[Atl\u00e9tico Junior]] in 1993, with whom he won the Colombian championship in 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===MLS career===\n[[File:Carlos Valderrama 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|Valderrama at a [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] fan meet in 1998]]\nValderrama began his [[Major League Soccer]] career with the US side [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] in the league's inaugural year of 1996, and won its ever first [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[Major League Soccer MVP Award|Most Valuable Player award]], finishing the season with 4 goals and 17 assists. He remained with the club for the 1997 season, and also spent a spell on loan back at Deportivo Cali in Colombia, before moving to another MLS side, [[Miami Fusion]], in 1998, where he also remained for two seasons.

In his first major international tournament, he helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, as his team's captain, where he was named the tournament's best player; during the tournament he scored the opening goal in Colombia's 2\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] on 1 July, their first match of the group stage.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n[[File:Valderrama colombia 1993.jpg|thumb|120px|Valderrama with Colombia in 1993]]\nSome of Valderrama's most impressive international performances came during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, during which he served as Colombia's captain. He helped his team to a 2\u20130 win against the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]] in Colombia's opening match of the group stage, scoring the second goal of the match with a strike from 20 yards. Colombia lost their second match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], however, needing at least a draw against the eventual champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in their final group match in order to advance to the next round of the competition. In the decisive game, German striker [[Pierre Littbarski]] scored what appeared to be the winning goal in the 88th minute of the game; however, within the last minute of injury time, Valderrama beat several opposing players and made a crucial left-footed pass to [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], who subsequently equalised, sealing a place for Colombia in the second round of the tournament with a 1\u20131 draw.

His impact in the final tournament at the advancing age of 37, however, was less decisive, and, despite defeating [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], Colombia once again suffered a first round exit, following a 2\u20130 defeat against [[England national football team|England]], which was Valderrama's final international appearance.<ref name=\"Profile-Colombia.com\"/><ref name=\"Colombian king\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nAlthough Valderrama is often defined as a 'classic [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]] [[playmaker]]', due to his creativity and offensive contribution, in reality he was not a classic playmaker in the traditional sense.

His control, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability and footwork were similar to those of smaller players, which for a player of Valderrama's size and physical build was fairly uncommon, and he frequently stood out throughout his career for his ability to use his strength, balance, composure, and flamboyant technique to shield the ball from opponents when put under pressure, and retain possession in difficult situations, often with elaborate skills, which made him an extremely popular figure with the fans. Valderrama's mix of physical strength, two-footed ability, unpredictability and flair enabled him to produce key and incisive performances against top tier teams, while his world class vision and exceptional passing and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability with his right foot made him one of the best [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers of his time; his height, physique and elevation also made him effective in the air, and he was also an accurate [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker and striker of the ball, despite not being a particularly prolific goalscorer.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"Colombia aren't creative enough\"/><ref name=\"Boots and a bouffant\"/><ref name=\"Baggio Takes Great Strides Toward Soccer Greatness\"/><ref name=\"Colombian flavour on the rise\"/><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlos-valderrama_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Valderrama, Carlos|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=Italian|author1=Matteo Dotto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=87394/index.html Valderrama: an artist's short spell in Montpellier - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"The Global Art of Soccer\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=2167928/index.html The day Colombia rocked the Monumental - FIFA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpLicqLvOA 1996 Valderrama vs West MLS All star - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube2\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7vf5So3_k MLS LEGENDS | Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"youtube3\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7A5smuVFs8 Carlos VALDERRAMA keep and pass compilation - christinayan - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/|title=Informe Especial del *Pibe* Valderrama|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.com/informes_especiales/2004/pibe/col4.asp|title=El m\u00e1s querido, el inolvidable...|publisher=Colombia.com|language=Spanish|author1=C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite his natural talent and ability as a footballer, Valderrama earned a reputation for having a \"languid\" playing style, as well as lacking notable pace, being unfit, and for having a poor defensive work-rate on the pitch, in particular after succumbing to the physical effects of ageing in his later career in the MLS. In his first season in France, he also initially struggled to adapt to the faster-paced, more physical and tactically rigorous European brand of football, which saw him play in an unfamiliar position, and gave him less space and time on the ball to dictate attacking passing moves; he was criticised at times for his lack of match fitness and his low defensive contribution, which initially limited his appearances with the club, although he later successfully became a key creative player in his team's starting line-up due to his discipline, skill, and his precise and efficient passing.<ref name=\"Colombian king\"/><ref name=\"treccani\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=dios/><ref name=\"Diez veces gracias\"/><ref name=\"I'd do it all again\"/> Despite these claims, earlier in his career, however, Valderrama demonstrated substantial pace, stamina, and defensive competence.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"prestigio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2008/07/21/C-115-no-tengo-miedo-a-perder-el-prestigio.php|title=\"No tengo miedo a perder el prestigio\"|publisher=El Gr\u00e1fico|language=Spanish|author1=Diego Borinsky|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nFormer French defender [[Laurent Blanc]], who played with Valderrama in Montpellier, voiced one of the most accurate descriptions for Valderrama, \"In the fast and furious European game he wasn't always at his ease.

During the latter period, a tradition of [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of monarchs made it a uniquely electable position in Europe (16th\u201318th centuries).\n\nThe first known Polish ruler is Duke [[Mieszko I]]<ref>http://www.ampolinstitute.org/pdf/Polish-Kings.pdf</ref> who [[Christianization of Poland|adopted]] [[Christianity]] under the authority of Rome in the year 966. He was succeeded by his son, [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], who greatly expanded the boundaries of the Polish state and ruled as the first king in 1025. The following centuries gave rise to the mighty [[Piast dynasty]], consisting of both kings such as [[Mieszko II Lambert]], [[Przemys\u0142 II]] or [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] and dukes like [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]]. The dynasty ceased to exist with the death of [[Casimir III the Great]] in 1370. In the same year, the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] became the ruling house with [[Louis I the Great|Louis I]] as king of both Poland and [[Hungary]]. His daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], later married Jogaila, the pagan [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], who in 1386 was baptized and crowned as [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], thus creating the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] and a personal union between Poland and [[Lithuania]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]], culture flourished and cities developed. This era of progress, also known as the [[Renaissance in Poland|Polish Renaissance]], continued until the [[Union of Lublin]] under [[Sigismund II Augustus]], which unofficially marked the end of the [[Polish Golden Age]]. After the death of last Jagiellonian king, the united [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became an [[elective monarchy]] with mostly foreigners elected as monarchs such as [[Henry III of France]], who witnessed the introduction of [[Golden Liberty]] and [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]], a great military commander who strengthened the nation. The meaningful rule of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa dynasty]] initially expanded the Commonwealth, developing the arts and crafts, as well as trade and commerce. King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], a talented but somewhat despotic ruler, involved the country in many wars, which subsequently resulted in the successful capture of [[Moscow]] and loss of [[Livonia]] to [[Sweden]]. His son, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], fiercely defended the Commonwealth's borders and continued the policy of his father until death, unlike [[John II Casimir]] whose tragic rule forced his [[abdication]].\n\nThe election of [[John III Sobieski]] to the Polish throne was a great success. His brilliant military tactics led to the [[Battle of Vienna|victory at Vienna]] in 1683 and partial recapture of land from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, the years that followed were not as successful; the long and ineffective rule of the [[Wettin dynasty]] ([[Augustus II the Strong]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]]) placed the Commonwealth under the influence of [[Saxony]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Additional feuds with rebelled nobility ([[szlachta]]) and most notably [[Stanis\u0142aw I Leszczy\u0144ski]] and [[France]] diminished the influence of Poland-Lithuania in the region. This led to the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] that occurred under King [[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], yet another [[Enlightenment in Poland|enlightened]], but ineffective monarch.\nThe Duchy of Warsaw existed from 1807 to 1815.\nThe last sovereign was [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] as [[Duke of Warsaw]], who throughout his political career attempted at rehabilitating the Polish state. After Poland [[Second Polish Republic|declared independence in 1918]], the [[monarchy]] was abolished and a [[Democracy|parliamentary republican authority]] was established.\n\n==Poland in the Early Middle Ages==\n''See: [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages]]''\n\n===Legendary rulers===\nMost of these rulers appear for the first time in chronicles from the 13th century\n\n{{Succession table monarch\n|name1       = '''[[Lech, \u010cech, and Rus|Lech I]]'''\n|nickname1   =\n|native1     =\n|life1       = 6th century\n|reignstart1 = 6th century\n|reignend1   = 6th century\n|notes1      = Legendary founder of the [[Polish nation]]\n|family1     = [[Lechites]] (Tribe)\n|image1      = Lech 111.PNG\n|alt1        =\n|name2       = '''[[Krakus|Krakus I]]'''\n|nickname2   = Krak\n|native2     =\n|life2       = 8th century\n|reignstart2 = 8th century\n|reignend2   = 8th century\n|notes2      = Legendary founder of [[Krak\u00f3w]]\n|family2     = [[Lechites]] (Tribe)\n|image2      = Krak.PNG\n|alt2        =\n|name3       = '''[[Krakus II]]'''\n|nickname3   = Krak II\n|native3     =\n|life3       = 8th century\n|reignstart3 = 8th century\n|reignend3   = 8th century\n|notes3      = According to the legend, he ruled in Krak\u00f3w\n|family3     = [[Lechites]] (Tribe)\n|image3      = Monarch-emp.png\n|alt3        =\n|name4       = '''[[Lech II]]'''\n|nickname4   =\n|native4     =\n|life4       = 8th century\n|reignstart4 = 8th century\n|reignend4   = 8th century\n|notes4      = According to the legend, he ruled in Krak\u00f3w\n|family4     = [[Lechites]] (Tribe)\n|image4      = Lech II.jpg\n|alt4        =\n|name5       = '''[[Princess Wanda|Wanda]]'''\n|nickname5   = W\u0105da\n|native5     =\n|life5       = 8th century\n|reignstart5 = 8th century\n|reignend5   = 8th century\n|notes5      = Legendary daughter of [[Krakus]]\n|family5     = [[Lechites]] (Tribe)\n|image5      = Chronica Polonorum Vanda.jpg\n|alt5        =\n|name6       = '''[[Leszko I]]'''\n|nickname6   = Leszek I\n|native6     = Duke\n|life6       = 7th / 8th centuries\n|reignstart6 = 7th / 8th centuries\n|reignend6   = 7th<ref>dated around 700 by [[Marcin Bielski]]</ref> / 8th centuries\n|notes6      = A legendary ruler of the West Slavic (\"proto-Polish\") tribe of [[Goplans]] and [[Polans (western)|Polans]]\n|family6     = [[Goplans]] and [[Polans (western)|Polans]] (Tribes)\n|image6      = LestekPrim1581.JPG\n|alt6        =\n|name7       = '''[[Leszko II]]'''\n|nickname7   = Leszek II\n|native7     = Duke\n|life7       = 8th century\n|reignstart7 = 8th century\n|reignend7   = 8th century\n|notes7      = A legendary duke of Polans\n|family7     = [[Popielids]]\n|image7      = LestekBis1581.JPG\n|alt7        =\n|name8       = '''[[Leszko III]]'''\n|nickname8   = Leszek III\n|native8     = Duke\n|life8       = 8th century\n|reignstart8 = 8th century\n|reignend8   = 8th century\n|notes8      = A legendary duke of Polans\n|family8     = [[Popielids]]\n|image8      = LestekTri1581.JPG\n|alt8        =\n|name9       = '''[[Popiel I]]'''\n|nickname9   =\n|native9     = Duke\n|life9       = 8th century\n|reignstart9 = 8th century\n|reignend9   = 8th century\n|notes9     = A legendary duke of Polans\n|family9     = [[Popielids]]\n|image9      = Popelus Primus.PNG\n|alt9        =\n|name10       = '''[[Popiel II]]'''\n|nickname10   =\n|native10     = Duke\n|life10       = 9th century\n|reignstart10 = 9th century\n|reignend10   = 9th century\n|notes10      = A legendary ruler dethroned by Piast.

During the latter period, a tradition of [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of monarchs made it a uniquely electable position in Europe (16th\u201318th centuries).\n\nThe first known Polish ruler is Duke [[Mieszko I]]<ref>http://www.ampolinstitute.org/pdf/Polish-Kings.pdf</ref> who [[Christianization of Poland|adopted]] [[Christianity]] under the authority of Rome in the year 966. He was succeeded by his son, [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], who greatly expanded the boundaries of the Polish state and ruled as the first king in 1025. The following centuries gave rise to the mighty [[Piast dynasty]], consisting of both kings such as [[Mieszko II Lambert]], [[Przemys\u0142 II]] or [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] and dukes like [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]]. The dynasty ceased to exist with the death of [[Casimir III the Great]] in 1370. In the same year, the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] became the ruling house with [[Louis I the Great|Louis I]] as king of both Poland and [[Hungary]]. His daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], later married Jogaila, the pagan [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], who in 1386 was baptized and crowned as [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], thus creating the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] and a personal union between Poland and [[Lithuania]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]], culture flourished and cities developed. This era of progress, also known as the [[Renaissance in Poland|Polish Renaissance]], continued until the [[Union of Lublin]] under [[Sigismund II Augustus]], which unofficially marked the end of the [[Polish Golden Age]]. After the death of last Jagiellonian king, the united [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became an [[elective monarchy]] with mostly foreigners elected as monarchs such as [[Henry III of France]], who witnessed the introduction of [[Golden Liberty]] and [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]], a great military commander who strengthened the nation. The meaningful rule of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa dynasty]] initially expanded the Commonwealth, developing the arts and crafts, as well as trade and commerce. King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], a talented but somewhat despotic ruler, involved the country in many wars, which subsequently resulted in the successful capture of [[Moscow]] and loss of [[Livonia]] to [[Sweden]]. His son, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]], fiercely defended the Commonwealth's borders and continued the policy of his father until death, unlike [[John II Casimir]] whose tragic rule forced his [[abdication]].\n\nThe election of [[John III Sobieski]] to the Polish throne was a great success. His brilliant military tactics led to the [[Battle of Vienna|victory at Vienna]] in 1683 and partial recapture of land from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, the years that followed were not as successful; the long and ineffective rule of the [[Wettin dynasty]] ([[Augustus II the Strong]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]]) placed the Commonwealth under the influence of [[Saxony]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Additional feuds with rebelled nobility ([[szlachta]]) and most notably [[Stanis\u0142aw I Leszczy\u0144ski]] and [[France]] diminished the influence of Poland-Lithuania in the region. This led to the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] that occurred under King [[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], yet another [[Enlightenment in Poland|enlightened]], but ineffective monarch.\nThe Duchy of Warsaw existed from 1807 to 1815.\nThe last sovereign was [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] as [[Duke of Warsaw]], who throughout his political career attempted at rehabilitating the Polish state.

It is located {{convert|279|km|mi}} north-west of [[Melbourne]] on the [[Murray Valley Highway]] a few kilometres north of its intersection with the [[Loddon Valley Highway]], elevation {{convert|78|m|ft}}. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, Kerang had a population of 3,893.<ref name=\"abs\"/> ''Kerang'' is believed to be an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word for [[Cockatoo]]. It is home to the largest solar and battery farm in the country which was opened in June 2019. The 50-megawatt battery system is located outside of Kerang and stores 100 per cent renewable energy. The 2,000 solar panels have become a tourist attraction and are drawing many businesses to the town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-14/australias-largest-solar-and-battery-farm-opens-in-kerang/11209666|title=Australia's largest solar and battery farm opens in Kerang, improves energy security|last=|first=|date=14 June 2019|work=ABC News|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\nThe [[Wemba-Wemba]] [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal people]] are thought to have been the area's first occupants. [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to visit the area, in 1836. [[Squatters]] began to settle in the area in 1845 and in 1848 Richard Beyes opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In 1857 Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become Kerang.

It is located {{convert|279|km|mi}} north-west of [[Melbourne]] on the [[Murray Valley Highway]] a few kilometres north of its intersection with the [[Loddon Valley Highway]], elevation {{convert|78|m|ft}}. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, Kerang had a population of 3,893.<ref name=\"abs\"/> ''Kerang'' is believed to be an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word for [[Cockatoo]]. It is home to the largest solar and battery farm in the country which was opened in June 2019. The 50-megawatt battery system is located outside of Kerang and stores 100 per cent renewable energy.

[[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to visit the area, in 1836. [[Squatters]] began to settle in the area in 1845 and in 1848 Richard Beyes opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In 1857 Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become Kerang. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use [[irrigation]] and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane.

Early in his career, he became the [[assistant mangaka|assistant]] to [[Tamakichi Sakura]] on ''{{Nihongo|The Form of Happiness|\u3057\u3042\u308f\u305b\u306e\u304b\u305f\u3061|Shiawase no Katachi}}'' as {{Nihongo|''Turtle-san''|\u30ab\u30e1\u3055\u3093|Kame-san}} in 1992 and [[K\u014dji Kiriyama]] (''[[Ninku]]''). At that time, he also submitted his first [[yomikiri]] Dragdoll Group to the [[Tezuka Award]] but was rejected. In 1994, Takei submitted his short story ''Anna the Itako'' to the 48th Tezuka Award and won the honorable mention. He was later introduced to [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]] and became his assistant along with [[Eiichiro Oda]] on ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]''. \n\nTakei published his short story ''Death Zero'' in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' winter special and ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' in the summer special of 1996. A reworked version of ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' became his first manga series published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' of 1997. Takei's longest-running series, ''[[Shaman King]]'' began serialization in Shueisha's ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' in 1998, though was forced to conclude in 2004. In 2007, Takei returned three years after the conclusion of ''Shaman King'' with a new ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' series; ''[[Jumbor Barutronica]]''. Set in the distant future, construction workers pilot [[mecha]].

Early in his career, he became the [[assistant mangaka|assistant]] to [[Tamakichi Sakura]] on ''{{Nihongo|The Form of Happiness|\u3057\u3042\u308f\u305b\u306e\u304b\u305f\u3061|Shiawase no Katachi}}'' as {{Nihongo|''Turtle-san''|\u30ab\u30e1\u3055\u3093|Kame-san}} in 1992 and [[K\u014dji Kiriyama]] (''[[Ninku]]''). At that time, he also submitted his first [[yomikiri]] Dragdoll Group to the [[Tezuka Award]] but was rejected. In 1994, Takei submitted his short story ''Anna the Itako'' to the 48th Tezuka Award and won the honorable mention. He was later introduced to [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]] and became his assistant along with [[Eiichiro Oda]] on ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]''. \n\nTakei published his short story ''Death Zero'' in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' winter special and ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' in the summer special of 1996. A reworked version of ''[[Butsu Zone]]'' became his first manga series published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' of 1997. Takei's longest-running series, ''[[Shaman King]]'' began serialization in Shueisha's ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' in 1998, though was forced to conclude in 2004. In 2007, Takei returned three years after the conclusion of ''Shaman King'' with a new ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' series; ''[[Jumbor Barutronica]]''. Set in the distant future, construction workers pilot [[mecha]]. One of them is killed and his memories are implanted in his clone, a thirty-year-old man in a five-year-old superpowered construction tool body.
