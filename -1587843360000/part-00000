However, recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be included among the [[Accipitriformes]], along with other birds of prey. However, they are still not closely related to the other vultures. Several species have a good sense of smell, unusual for [[Birds of prey|raptors]], and are able to smell dead animals from great heights, up to a mile away.\n\nThe seven species are:\n* [[Black vulture]] ''Coragyps atratus'' in South America and north to the US\n* [[Turkey vulture]] ''Cathartes aura'' throughout the Americas to southern Canada\n* [[Lesser yellow-headed vulture]] ''Cathartes burrovianus'' in South America and north to Mexico\n* [[Greater yellow-headed vulture]] ''Cathartes melambrotus'' in the [[Amazon Basin]] of tropical South America\n* [[California condor]] ''Gymnogyps californianus'' in California, formerly widespread in the mountains of western North America\n* [[Andean condor]] ''Vultur gryphus'' in the [[Andes]]\n* [[King vulture]] ''Sarcoramphus papa'' from southern Mexico to northern Argentina\n\n== Feeding ==\nVultures are [[scavenger]]s, meaning they eat dead animals.

[[Daylighting]] is cheaper than using indoor electric lights during the day. The device is simple: a transparent [[two-liter bottle]] is filled with water plus a little bleach to inhibit [[algae|algal growth]] and fitted into a hole in a roof. The device functions like a [[deck prism]]: during [[daytime]] the water inside the bottle refracts sunlight, delivering about as much light as a 40\u201360 watt [[incandescent bulb]] to the interior. A properly installed solar bottle can last up to 5 years.<ref name=\"Inhabitat\">{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/mit-students-install-10000-revolutionary-solar-bottle-lamps-in-manila-slums/ |title=10,000 Dirt Cheap and Life-Altering Plastic Lamps Installed in Manila Slums &#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/video/2011/07/11/bringing-light-to-the-poor-one-liter-at?videoId=216968892 |title=Bringing light to the poor, one liter at a time &#124; Video &#124; Reuters.com |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe use of plastic bottles in this way to provide indoor lighting from daylight was developed by [[Alfredo Moser]] of Brazil.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23536914 BBC News article about Alfredo Moser and his invention]</ref> Using the technology as a social enterprise was first launched in the Philippines by Illac Diaz under the My Shelter Foundation in April 2011.<ref name=\"riomatters.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://riomatters.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/1-liter-of-light-by-ami-valdemoro/ |title=A Liter of Light Goes a Long Way (by Ami Valdemoro) &#124; Harvard Students Talk Rio+20 |publisher=Riomatters.wordpress.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> In order to help the idea to grow sustainably, Diaz implemented a \u201clocal entrepreneur\u201d business model whereby bottle bulbs are assembled and installed by local people, who can earn a small income for their work.

The project\u2019s innovation lies in its utilization of cheap, durable and readily available materials to produce high quality natural lighting enabling the urban poor to have access to an affordable, environmentally friendly long-term alternative to electric light for use during the day.\n\nMost of the plastic bottles used are recycled 1.5 liter bottles.  After being filled with water and a little bleach, the bottle is pushed through a steel sheet that serves as a metal lock to prevent it from slipping.  It is then embedded into a corrugated iron roof. A small part of the bottle is left outside while the rest of it protrudes into the house.  Sealant is put around the hole made in the roof to keep it weather proof. The refractive properties of water ensures that the light from the sun that reaches the inside of the bottle becomes omni-directional mimicking an electric light bulb and emitting the same amount of light as a 40\u201360&nbsp;W incandescent bulb depending on the amount of solar [[insolation]] available.  Adding bleach to the water prevents it from turning green with algae and ensures a high quality light keeping the water clear for a longer time. In order to facilitate use of the invention through open source mechanisms, step-by-step guides on materials and installation are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTIYUUK70I |title=How to Build a Solar Bottle Bulb 2.0 ( Updated English Version) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Glue ===\n\nUsing an appropriate durable, leak-proof, space-filling glue, that does not melt because of the sun, is one of the main challenges for the solution.

[[Daylighting]] is cheaper than using indoor electric lights during the day. The device is simple: a transparent [[two-liter bottle]] is filled with water plus a little bleach to inhibit [[algae|algal growth]] and fitted into a hole in a roof. The device functions like a [[deck prism]]: during [[daytime]] the water inside the bottle refracts sunlight, delivering about as much light as a 40\u201360 watt [[incandescent bulb]] to the interior. A properly installed solar bottle can last up to 5 years.<ref name=\"Inhabitat\">{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/mit-students-install-10000-revolutionary-solar-bottle-lamps-in-manila-slums/ |title=10,000 Dirt Cheap and Life-Altering Plastic Lamps Installed in Manila Slums &#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/video/2011/07/11/bringing-light-to-the-poor-one-liter-at?videoId=216968892 |title=Bringing light to the poor, one liter at a time &#124; Video &#124; Reuters.com |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe use of plastic bottles in this way to provide indoor lighting from daylight was developed by [[Alfredo Moser]] of Brazil.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23536914 BBC News article about Alfredo Moser and his invention]</ref> Using the technology as a social enterprise was first launched in the Philippines by Illac Diaz under the My Shelter Foundation in April 2011.<ref name=\"riomatters.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://riomatters.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/1-liter-of-light-by-ami-valdemoro/ |title=A Liter of Light Goes a Long Way (by Ami Valdemoro) &#124; Harvard Students Talk Rio+20 |publisher=Riomatters.wordpress.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> In order to help the idea to grow sustainably, Diaz implemented a \u201clocal entrepreneur\u201d business model whereby bottle bulbs are assembled and installed by local people, who can earn a small income for their work.

The project\u2019s innovation lies in its utilization of cheap, durable and readily available materials to produce high quality natural lighting enabling the urban poor to have access to an affordable, environmentally friendly long-term alternative to electric light for use during the day.\n\nMost of the plastic bottles used are recycled 1.5 liter bottles.  After being filled with water and a little bleach, the bottle is pushed through a steel sheet that serves as a metal lock to prevent it from slipping.  It is then embedded into a corrugated iron roof. A small part of the bottle is left outside while the rest of it protrudes into the house.  Sealant is put around the hole made in the roof to keep it weather proof. The refractive properties of water ensures that the light from the sun that reaches the inside of the bottle becomes omni-directional mimicking an electric light bulb and emitting the same amount of light as a 40\u201360&nbsp;W incandescent bulb depending on the amount of solar [[insolation]] available.  Adding bleach to the water prevents it from turning green with algae and ensures a high quality light keeping the water clear for a longer time. In order to facilitate use of the invention through open source mechanisms, step-by-step guides on materials and installation are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTIYUUK70I |title=How to Build a Solar Bottle Bulb 2.0 ( Updated English Version) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Glue ===\n\nUsing an appropriate durable, leak-proof, space-filling glue, that does not melt because of the sun, is one of the main challenges for the solution.
