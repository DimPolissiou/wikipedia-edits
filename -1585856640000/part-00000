Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation. The first Bussey Institute building was completed in 1871 and served as headquarters for an [[undergraduate]] school of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary Jane|date=|title=Benjamin Bussey, Woodland Hill, and the Creation of the Arnold Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2006-64-1-benjamin-bussey-woodland-hill-and-the-creation-of-the-arnold-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=64(1)|pages=2-9|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June of 1872 [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] was appointed as a professor of horticulture and the curator of the Arnold Arboretum; the following year he was appointed director of both the Arnold Arboretum and the Harvard Botanic Garden.

The land was deeded to the City of Boston in 1882 and incorporated into the \"Emerald Necklace\". Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway. Public transportation to the Arboretum is available on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] to its terminus at [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills Station]] and by bus ([[Green Line \"E\" Branch|#39]]) to the Monument in Jamaica Plain. The Arboretum is within easy walking distance from either of these points.  The Arboretum's southwest gate is very close to the turn between Weld and Walter Streets on the [[51 (MBTA bus)|#51 bus line]] between Cleveland Circle/Reservoir and Forest Hills.

Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October.

Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation.

Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway.

Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962.

Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October.

It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain.

In June 1670 the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] was negotiated between Louis and Charles  using his sister [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta of Orl\u00e9ans]]; very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions. While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third. However, the French were inexperienced, their ships badly designed and co-operation with the English plagued by suspicion.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=38-39}} While Dutch numbers were further reduced by [[Admiralty of Friesland|Friesland]] retaining ships for defence against M\u00fcnster, better training gave them operational equality.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=231}} \n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], whose training compensated for numerical inferiority]]\nIn the battles of 1666, the Dutch were hampered by lack of familiarity with their new, much heavier, warships, the complex federal command system and conflict between [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Cornelis Tromp]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=181}} By 1672, these had been corrected, and De Ruyter's intensive training of his fleet in [[line-of-battle]] manoeuvres installed a new sense of coherence and discipline.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=278-279}}\n \nDutch ships were generally better gun platforms, whose shallow draft suited operations close to shore but were slow and less effective in open seas.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002 |pp=40-41}} Their maritime power was past its peak by the time of the [[Peace of Nijmegen]] in 1678: it had substantially declined in the preceding four years under the continuing stress of the [[Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch]] and [[Scanian War]]s which had prevented it strengthening its fleet, and because of qualitative improvements among its rivals.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=43-44, 68}}\n\nEngland provided two-thirds of an Anglo-French fleet of 98 'great ships and frigates', whose role was to gain control of Dutch waters, land an expeditionary force and attack its shipping. Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of [[Royal Scots|Dumbarton's]], a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.{{sfn|Childs|2014|p=16}}\n\nOpposition forced Charles to seek other sources of finance; in January 1672, he suspended [[Stop of the Exchequer|repayment of Crown debts]], which produced \u00a31.3&nbsp;million but had disastrous economic effects. Many [[City of London|London merchants]] were ruined and it shut off the short-term financing essential to international trade.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=80}} Shortly before the declaration of war, in late March he ordered an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort.{{sfn|Clodfelter|1992|p=46}}\n\nCharles and his ministers appreciated that an unprovoked war against the Protestant Netherlands an alliance with Catholic France would probably be unpopular, and that the [[Stop of the Exchequer]] of 2 January 1672 would make financiers in the City of London cautious about providing funds to the government to prosecute such a war. It was partly to increase the government's popularity among [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] merchants he issued [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] in 15 March.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=74}} In the event, the Declaration of Indulgence, which removed restrictions on Catholics as well as Nonconformists, did little to decrease hostility to the French alliance.

On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Li\u00e8ge; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of [[Maastricht]], crossed the [[Meuse]] and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of [[Rheinberg]], [[Orsoy]], Buderich and [[Wesel]].

A stream of venomous Orangist pamphlets accused the De Witt brothers in particular and the Regent regime in general of betraying the country to the French and of plotting against the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}} There was widespread rioting, with Orangists seizing control of city councils and demanding William take over government.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=163}} On 22 June, De Witt was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt.{{sfn|Rowen|1980|p=842}} One of the would-be assassins, Jacob van der Graaf, who was arrested and quickly tried and executed was popularly regarded as a martyr.

Louis originally agreed but success meant he no longer considered this compromise necessary.{{sfn|'t Hart|2014|pp=30-33}}\n\nOn 14 June, the States of Holland decided to ask peace terms from England and France, offering Louis the key fortresses in the south and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=86}} He responded with additional demands; either religious freedom for Catholics or sovereignty over [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Guelders]]. This was a deliberate delaying tactic; he knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}} The English were to be ceded [[Delfzijl]], in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], already besieged by M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}}\n\nDepicting Charles as the one man who could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to William's appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington, one of the few English politicians privy to the full content of Treaty of Dover, and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result.

They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace.

These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little.\n\nDue to the slow proliferation of information at that time, conflicts still occurred after the declaration of peace. The [[Battle of Ronas Voe]] took place on 14 March 1674{{sfn|Amsterdamsche Courant|1674}} (23 days after the signing of the Treaty of Westminster) when the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] [[East Indiaman]] ''[[Wapen van Rotterdam]]'' was captured in [[Ronas Voe]], [[Shetland]] by [[HMS Newcastle (1653)|HMS ''Newcastle'']].{{sfn|Bruce|1914|pp=101\u2013102}} It, along with [[HMS Cambridge (1666)|HMS ''Cambridge'']] and [[HMS Crown (1654)|HMS ''Crown'']] were sent instructions to capture the vessel,{{sfn|Pepys|1904|pp=247, 249\u2013250}} which had become stranded in Shetland due to poor weather which had caused the ship to lose its masts and rudder.{{sfn|Pepys|1923|p=30}} ''Wapen van Rotterdam'' taken back to England as a [[prize of war]].{{sfn|London Gazette 27 March|1674|p=2}} A contemporary Dutch newspaper reported that while 400 crew were originally on board ''Wapen van Rotterdam'', later only 100 prisoners were being transported by ''Crown,''{{sfn|Amsterdamsche Courant 10 April|1674}} suggesting up to 300 crew may have been killed, although additional prisoners might have been transported on the other English ships.\n\nDespite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=132}} at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=142}} In 1677, he forced his niece [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to marry William;{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=114}} this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n[[File:Van Soest, Attack on the Medway.jpg|thumb|left|The 1667 [[Raid on the Medway]] severely damaged Charles' prestige]]\nLouis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], although he retained towns like [[Charleroi]] and [[Tournai]]. As Dutch and French aims in the Spanish Netherlands could not be reconciled, it made sense to eliminate the Dutch Republic first.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lesaffer |first1=Randall |title=The Wars of Louis XIV in Treaties (Part III): The Secret Alliance of Dover (1 June 1670) |url=https://opil.ouplaw.com/page/secret-alliance-dover/the-wars-of-louis-xiv-in-treaties-part-iii-the-secret-alliance-of-dover-1-june-1670 |website=OPIL |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref> Detaching Sweden from the Triple Alliance was straightforward, since the subsidies promised by the Dutch remained unpaid; the next target was England. In June 1670 the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] was negotiated between Louis and Charles  using his sister [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta of Orl\u00e9ans]]; very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions. While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third.

Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of [[Royal Scots|Dumbarton's]], a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.{{sfn|Childs|2014|p=16}}\n\nOpposition forced Charles to seek other sources of finance; in January 1672, he suspended [[Stop of the Exchequer|repayment of Crown debts]], which produced \u00a31.3&nbsp;million but had disastrous economic effects.

It was partly to increase the government's popularity among [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] merchants he issued [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] in 15 March.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=74}} In the event, the Declaration of Indulgence, which removed restrictions on Catholics as well as Nonconformists, did little to decrease hostility to the French alliance.

On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Li\u00e8ge; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of [[Maastricht]], crossed the [[Meuse]] and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of [[Rheinberg]], [[Orsoy]], Buderich and [[Wesel]].

A stream of venomous Orangist pamphlets accused the De Witt brothers in particular and the Regent regime in general of betraying the country to the French and of plotting against the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=81}} There was widespread rioting, with Orangists seizing control of city councils and demanding William take over government.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=163}} On 22 June, De Witt was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt.{{sfn|Rowen|1980|p=842}} One of the would-be assassins, Jacob van der Graaf, who was arrested and quickly tried and executed was popularly regarded as a martyr.

Louis originally agreed but success meant he no longer considered this compromise necessary.{{sfn|'t Hart|2014|pp=30-33}}\n\nOn 14 June, the States of Holland decided to ask peace terms from England and France, offering Louis the key fortresses in the south and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=86}} He responded with additional demands; either religious freedom for Catholics or sovereignty over [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Guelders]]. This was a deliberate delaying tactic; he knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}} The English were to be ceded [[Delfzijl]], in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], already besieged by M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}}\n\nDepicting Charles as the one man who could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to William's appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington, one of the few English politicians privy to the full content of Treaty of Dover, and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result. William was well-informed on English opposition and had assurances of Imperial support from Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's envoy in the Hague. Lisola arranged for Spanish troops to hold [['s-Hertogenbosch]] and [[Breda]], releasing their Dutch garrisons for the field army.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|pp=57-58}}\n\nWilliam rejected this offer, although he held out the possibility of a deal if Arlington and Buckingham could ease French demands. They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering the herring rights, \u00a3400,000, Sluys and [[Surinam]], in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace; the latter was clearly unacceptable.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=91}} Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis now required England also be ceded the islands of [[Voorne]], which contained the Dutch main naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]], and [[Goeree]]. These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little.\n\nDue to the slow proliferation of information at that time, conflicts still occurred after the declaration of peace. The [[Battle of Ronas Voe]] took place on 14 March 1674{{sfn|Amsterdamsche Courant|1674}} (23 days after the signing of the Treaty of Westminster) when the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] [[East Indiaman]] ''[[Wapen van Rotterdam]]'' was captured in [[Ronas Voe]], [[Shetland]] by [[HMS Newcastle (1653)|HMS ''Newcastle'']].{{sfn|Bruce|1914|pp=101\u2013102}} It, along with [[HMS Cambridge (1666)|HMS ''Cambridge'']] and [[HMS Crown (1654)|HMS ''Crown'']] were sent instructions to capture the vessel,{{sfn|Pepys|1904|pp=247, 249\u2013250}} which had become stranded in Shetland due to poor weather which had caused the ship to lose its masts and rudder.{{sfn|Pepys|1923|p=30}} ''Wapen van Rotterdam'' taken back to England as a [[prize of war]].{{sfn|London Gazette 27 March|1674|p=2}} A contemporary Dutch newspaper reported that while 400 crew were originally on board ''Wapen van Rotterdam'', later only 100 prisoners were being transported by ''Crown,''{{sfn|Amsterdamsche Courant 10 April|1674}} suggesting up to 300 crew may have been killed, although additional prisoners might have been transported on the other English ships.\n\nDespite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=132}} at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=142}} In 1677, he forced his niece [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to marry William;{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=114}} this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It can exist in either the \u03b1- or \u03b2-[[anomer]]ic form.\n\n==Reactions of \u03b1-glucose 1-phosphate==\n===Catabolic===\nIn [[glycogenolysis]], it is the direct product of the reaction in which [[glycogen phosphorylase]] cleaves off a [[molecule]] of [[glucose]] from a greater [[glycogen]] structure. A deficiency of muscle glycogen phosphorylase is known as [[glycogen storage disease type V]] (McArdle Disease).\n\nTo be utilized in cellular catabolism it must first be converted to [[glucose 6-phosphate]] by the [[enzyme]] [[phosphoglucomutase]]. One reason that cells form glucose 1-phosphate instead of glucose during glycogen breakdown is that the very polar phosphorylated glucose cannot leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism.

It can exist in either the \u03b1- or \u03b2-[[anomer]]ic form.\n\n==Reactions of \u03b1-glucose 1-phosphate==\n===Catabolic===\nIn [[glycogenolysis]], it is the direct product of the reaction in which [[glycogen phosphorylase]] cleaves off a [[molecule]] of [[glucose]] from a greater [[glycogen]] structure. A deficiency muscle glycogen phosphorylase is known as [[glycogen storage disease type V]] (McArdle Disease).\n\nTo be utilized in cellular catabolism it must first be converted to [[glucose 6-phosphate]] by the [[enzyme]] [[phosphoglucomutase]]. One reason that cells form glucose 1-phosphate instead of glucose during glycogen breakdown is that the very polar phosphorylated glucose cannot leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism.

Afterwards he would appear as a law enforcement official in a number of other films and TV productions dealing with organized crime, including a semi-biographical movie about [[Giovanni Falcone]], where he acted as the titular judge. In 2008, in a reversal of roles, he portrayed longtime Mafia boss [[Bernardo Provenzano]] in the TV movie ''L'ultimo padrino''.

Two years later he won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] award at the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]] for his role of the [[homosexuality|homosexual]] worker in ironical melodrama ''[[Ernesto (film)|Ernesto]]'' (1978, by Samperi).<ref name=\"berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1979/03_preistr_ger_1979/03_Preistraeger_1979.html |title=Berlinale 1978: Prize Winners |accessdate=14 August 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nHe appeared in several TV movies in the 1970s, but 1983 marked the beginning of his greatest television popularity when he played the lead as a police inspector investigating [[the Mafia]] in Damiano Damiani's TV series ''[[La piovra]]''. He went on to play the same part in the subsequent three series, until his character's assassination. Afterwards he would appear as a law enforcement official in a number of other films and TV productions dealing with organized crime, including a semi-biographical movie about [[Giovanni Falcone]], where he acted as the titular judge. In 2008, in a reversal of roles, he portrayed longtime Mafia boss [[Bernardo Provenzano]] in the TV movie ''L'ultimo padrino''.  A recognizable role to [[United States|US]] audiences is that of an Italian businessman in the [[1988 in film|1988]] [[comedy]] ''[[Big Business (1988 film)|Big Business]]''.\n\nUntil a divorce in 1994, he was married to actress [[Simonetta Stefanelli]].

However, past Dexter refuses to believe he sent his sister to the past and when Dee Dee meets past Dee Dee, chaos ensues.\n__TOC__\n==Story==\nThe short starts with a clock on Dexter's desk turning to 4:00 with Dexter and Dee Dee flying in the air and a vicious roar right after. It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed. The Dee Dees arrive again at 3:00 to see Dexter righting something and warn him, he then firmly says that they're interrupting his \"...very important calculations.\" as it shows Dexter's papers for the doorway.<ref>{{cite episode |title=DeeDeemensional |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Dexter's Laboratory |series-link= |first=Rob |last=Renzetti |network=TNT |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=english}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIMDb: {{Rating|7.6|10}} Rating Graph: {{Rating|7.6|10}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title          = DeeDeemensional\n| series         = [[Dexter's Laboratory]]\n| image          = The intertitle for DeeDeemensional.jpg\n| image_size     = 220\n| alt            = Dexter looks up with his 3d glasses as his sister appears twice, on in blue and one in red, as the title of the episode shows below.\n| caption        = The [[intertitle]].\n| season         = 1\n| series_no      =\n| episode        = 1a\n| director       = \n* [[Rob Renzetti]] (director)\n* [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] (director)\n* [[Horseman Cao]] (animation director)\n* [[Chris Cuddington]] (animation director)\n* [[Bodie Chandler]] (music director)\n| writer         = Rob Renzetti\n| story          = \n| teleplay       = \n| based_on       = \n| narrator       = \n| presenter      =\n| producer       = \n* Genndy Tartakovsky (producer)\n* [[Lary Huber]] (executive producer))\n* [[Buzz Potamkin]] (executive producer)\n* [[Fred Seibert]] (executive producer)\n* [[Ted Turner]] (executive producer)\n* [[Davis Doi]] (supervising producer)\n* [[Debby Hindman]] (associative producer)\n* [[Bob Onorato]] (line producer)\n| music          = \n* Bodie Chandler (director)\n* [[Gary Lionelli]] (composer)\n* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (composer)\n* [[Pamela Phillips Oland]] (end lyrics)\n| photographer   = \n| editor         = \n* [[Pat Foley]] (supervising film editor)\n* [[Paul Douglas (editor)|Paul Douglas]] (supervising film editor) (supervising editor)\n* [[Tom Gleason]] (supervising editor)\n* [[Gina Lamar]] (post-production assistant)\n* [[John Forrest Niss]] (post-production executive)\n* [[William Deboer Jr.]] (negative cutter)\n| production     = 102a<ref>{{cite web |title=DeeDeemensional |url=https://dexterslab.fandom.com/wiki/DeeDeemensional |website=Dexter's Laboratory Wiki |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| airdate        = {{Start date|1996|04|27}}\n| length         = 7 minutes\n| awards         = \n| guests         = \n| prev           = \n| next           = [[Dial M for Monkey: Magmanamus]]\n| season_article = \n| episode_list   = [[List of Dexter's Laboratory episodes]]\n}}\n\"'''DeeDeemensional'''\" is the first of thre shorts of the first episode of the [[Cartoon Network|animated television series]] \"[[Dexter's Laboratory]]\".

Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head. Dexter is over it, he rips his costume and stomps off to his interdimensional doorway. He invites the two Dee Dees to see his doorway, to which he then activates and tells the girls that they're gonna test it. Suddenly the same pink monster appears behind Dexter and then the clock reaches 4:00.\n\nThe cycle starts again with Dexter trying all options possible and then forced to write a message to his past self. Dee Dee starts to familiarize the reoccurring events and finally remembers what's going to happen. When Dexter gives Dee Dee the message, she gives Dexter the other message and before he could say anything to the girls, they had already gone into the time machine, Dexter reminds himself again that he's doomed. The Dee Dees arrive again at 3:00 to see Dexter righting something and warn him, he then firmly says that they're interrupting his \"...very important calculations.\" as it shows Dexter's papers for the doorway.<ref>{{cite episode |title=DeeDeemensional |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Dexter's Laboratory |series-link= |first=Rob |last=Renzetti |network=TNT |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=english}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIMDb: {{Rating|7.6|10}} Rating Graph: {{Rating|7.6|10}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n", "name_user": "Opirentis", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeeDeemensional_(Dexter%27s_Laboratory)"}

[\u2026] The bamboo tube eventually was replaced by a larger curved wooden board and while in one or two zither types fixed or movable bridges were used, the noble ch'in remained an unfretted instrument. Despite the fact that the cheng is not mentioned in the Classics, it is mentioned here because of its old age. The movable bridges which allowed variable tunings linked the cheng securely with popular music. It still exists side by side with the distinguished ch'in and se. Since the fourth or third centuries B.C. there existed another form of the se, a zither with five (to thirteen) strings, called chu (M 1375). The instrument is not mentioned in the Classics.\"</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[[File:Kong Ring being played at Mondolkiri Memorial at Bou Sra Waterfall Waterfall in Cambodia.webm|thumb|Kong ring tube zither being played at Mondolkiri Memorial at Bou Sra Waterfall Waterfall in Cambodia]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=54&v=9FpkUm7CuHg Video showing kong ring being played.]\n*[http://www.istov.de/audio/goong.mp3 Sound clip of Vietnamese dinh goong playing.]\n*[http://www.thaisounds.com/tribal/Track%2010%20Kayaw%20zither.mp3 Kayaw tube zither being played with singing, lament over lost love.]\n*[https://choukhmer.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/kong-ring/ Page has photo of bowed version of a tube zither.]\n\n{{Cambodian musical instruments}}\n\n[[Category:Cambodian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Zithers]]\n[[Category:Tube zithers]]\n\n\n{{string-instrument-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Musical instrument}}\n{{Infobox Instrument\n| name\t\t=Kong ring \u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784\n| names\t\t=\n| image\t\t= File:Kong ring (\u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784).jpg\n| image_capt\t= Musician sings and plucks the strings of his '''kong ring''' \u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784 (tube zither), in [[Mondulkiri Province]], Cambodia. \n| background\t= string\n| classification= [[String instrument]]\n\t\t  [[Plucked string instrument]]\n| hornbostel_sachs\t=* 312.11\n*[[List of chordophones by Hornbostel\u2013Sachs number| 312.122]]\n| hornbostel_sachs_desc\t= *Idiochord tube zithers\n*Heterochord tube zithers with extra resonator.\n| developed\t= \n|timbre         =\n| decay         = \n| range\t\t= \n| related\t= *[[\u0110\u00e0n goong]], Vietnam\n}}\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kong ring (\u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784) tube zither.jpg|thumb|Kong ring (\u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784)]] -->\nThe '''kong ring''' or '''gung treng''' (Khmer: \u1782\u1784\u17cb\u179a\u17c1\u1784) is a Cambodian [[tube zither]], in which a tube of bamboo is used as a resonator for stings that run along the outside of the tube, lengthwise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://maorm.com/pagedetailfull.php?article=239|title=\u17a2\u17b8\u1799\u17c9\u17b6!!! \u1794\u17d2\u179b\u17c2\u1780\u17a2\u17b6\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1798\u178e\u17cd\u1791\u17c0\u178f\u17a0\u17be\u1799! \u178f\u17c4\u17c7\u1798\u1780\u1798\u17be\u179b\u17a7\u1794\u1780\u179a\u178e\u17cd\u1797\u17d2\u179b\u17c1\u1784\u1793\u17b7\u1784\u1794\u1791\u1785\u1798\u17d2\u179a\u17c0\u1784\u179a\u1794\u179f\u17cb\u1787\u1793\u1787\u17b6\u178f\u17b7\u1796\u17d2\u1793\u1784\u179c\u17b7\u1789\u1798\u17d2\u178a\u1784\u1798\u17be\u179b!!, [Wow !!!

Detroit Monographs in Musicology.'' Harmonie Park Press. p. 101. \"According to the Shuo Wen the cheng was a bamboo-tube zither. [\u2026] The bamboo tube eventually was replaced by a larger curved wooden board and while in one or two zither types fixed or movable bridges were used, the noble ch'in remained an unfretted instrument. Despite the fact that the cheng is not mentioned in the Classics, it is mentioned here because of its old age. The movable bridges which allowed variable tunings linked the cheng securely with popular music. It still exists side by side with the distinguished ch'in and se. Since the fourth or third centuries B.C. there existed another form of the se, a zither with five (to thirteen) strings, called chu (M 1375). The instrument is not mentioned in the Classics.\"</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[[File:Kong Ring being played at Mondolkiri Memorial at Bou Sra Waterfall Waterfall in Cambodia.webm|thumb|Kong ring tube zither being played at Mondolkiri Memorial at Bou Sra Waterfall Waterfall in Cambodia]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=54&v=9FpkUm7CuHg Video showing kong ring being played.]\n*[http://www.istov.de/audio/goong.mp3 Sound clip of Vietnamese dinh goong playing.]\n*[http://www.thaisounds.com/tribal/Track%2010%20Kayaw%20zither.mp3 Kayaw tube zither being played with singing, lament over lost love.]\n*[https://choukhmer.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/kong-ring/ Page has photo of bowed version of a tube zither.]\n\n{{Cambodian musical instruments}}\n\n[[Category:Cambodian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Zithers]]\n[[Category:Tube zithers]]\n\n\n{{string-instrument-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toKrem(link changed toKrem (instrument)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_ring"}
