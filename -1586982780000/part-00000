In the segments, Slater would enter the ring and issue challenges to \"the so-called legends\" or \"any former WWE champion\", which resulted in him losing a series of [[squash match]]es, with the first two losses to [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]]. He was further humiliated in a comedic segment by [[Roddy Piper]], [[Wendi Richter]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]]. He defeated [[Doink the Clown]] on the July 2, 2012 edition of ''Raw'', but following the match, [[Diamond Dallas Page]] came to the ring and performed the [[Cutter (professional wrestling)|Diamond Cutter]] on Slater. On the July 9, 2012 episode of ''Raw'', after losing to [[M\u00edstico|Sin Cara]], Slater berated the audience and issued a challenge \"to any former champion\" and guaranteed he would defeat him; [[Bob Backlund]] accepted the challenge.

It runs {{convert|27.20|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 7|Route&nbsp;7]] and [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|County Route&nbsp;507]] (CR&nbsp;507) in [[North Arlington, New Jersey|North Arlington]] north to the [[New York (state)|New York]] border along [[Interstate&nbsp;287]] (I-287) in [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], where [[New York State Route&nbsp;17]] (NY&nbsp;17) continues into New York. Between Route&nbsp;7 and [[New Jersey Route 3|Route&nbsp;3]] in [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]], Route&nbsp;17 serves as a local road. From Route&nbsp;3 north to the junction with [[U.S. Route&nbsp;46]] (US&nbsp;46) in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey|Hasbrouck Heights]], the road is a [[suburban]] [[arterial (road)|arterial]] with [[jughandle]]s. The portion of Route&nbsp;17 from US&nbsp;46 to I-287 near the state line in Mahwah is a [[limited-access road]] with all cross traffic handled by [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], and many driveways and side streets accessed from [[right-in/right-out]] ramps from the right lane. For three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of [[New Jersey Route 4|Route&nbsp;4]], well over a hundred retail stores and several large shopping malls line the route in the borough of [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]]. The remainder of this portion of Route&nbsp;17 features lighter suburban development. The northernmost portion of Route&nbsp;17 in Mahwah runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-287 to the New York border.\n\nPrior to 1927, the route was designated as '''Route&nbsp;17N''', which was to run from [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to the New York state line. This route had followed various local streets, including [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] north of [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]]. In 1927, Route&nbsp;17N became '''Route&nbsp;2''', which was designated along the portion of Route&nbsp;17N between Route&nbsp;7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. This route was moved to a multilane [[divided highway]] alignment north of Rutherford by 1937. Route&nbsp;2 became Route&nbsp;17 in 1942 to match the designation of NY&nbsp;17 for defense purposes during [[World War II]]. The entire Route&nbsp;17 corridor was once planned to be a [[freeway]] until the 1960s, and later plans to extend the route south of Route&nbsp;3 to [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|I-280]] in 1972 and to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in 1987 both failed. Over the years, the portion of Route&nbsp;17 north of Route&nbsp;3 has seen many improvements, including the widening of much of the road to six lanes and the removal of most at-grade intersections in the 1950s as well as more recent improvements to the interchanges with Route&nbsp;4 in Paramus in 1999 and Essex Street on the [[Lodi, New Jersey|Lodi]]/[[Maywood, New Jersey|Maywood]] border in 2008. The route is currently undergoing improvements between Route&nbsp;3 and US&nbsp;46 and is expected to see improvements from Williams Avenue in Hasbrouck Heights to south of Route&nbsp;4 in Paramus.\n\n==Route description==\n[[Image:2018-07-19 10 17 40 View north along New Jersey State Route 17 (Ridge Road) just north of New Jersey State Route 7 and County Route 507 (Belleville Turnpike) in North Arlington, Bergen County, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|First northbound Route 17 reassurance shield past the southern terminus at Route 7/CR 507 in North Arlington]]Route&nbsp;17 begins at an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 7|Route&nbsp;7]] and [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;507]] (Belleville Turnpike) on the border of [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] and [[North Arlington, New Jersey|North Arlington]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].

It runs {{convert|27.20|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 7|Route&nbsp;7]] and [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|County Route&nbsp;507]] (CR&nbsp;507) in [[North Arlington, New Jersey|North Arlington]] north to the [[New York (state)|New York]] border along [[Interstate&nbsp;287]] (I-287) in [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], where [[New York State Route&nbsp;17]] (NY&nbsp;17) continues into New York. Between Route&nbsp;7 and [[New Jersey Route 3|Route&nbsp;3]] in [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]], Route&nbsp;17 serves as a local road. From Route&nbsp;3 north to the junction with [[U.S. Route&nbsp;46]] (US&nbsp;46) in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey|Hasbrouck Heights]], the road is a [[suburban]] [[arterial (road)|arterial]] with [[jughandle]]s. The portion of Route&nbsp;17 from US&nbsp;46 to I-287 near the state line in Mahwah is a [[limited-access road]] with all cross traffic handled by [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], and many driveways and side streets accessed from [[right-in/right-out]] ramps from the right lane. For three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of [[New Jersey Route 4|Route&nbsp;4]], well over a hundred retail stores and several large shopping malls line the route in the borough of [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]]. The remainder of this portion of Route&nbsp;17 features lighter suburban development. The northernmost portion of Route&nbsp;17 in Mahwah runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-287 to the New York border.\n\nPrior to 1927, the route was designated as '''Route&nbsp;17N''', which was to run from [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to the New York state line. This route had followed various local streets, including [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] north of [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]]. In 1927, Route&nbsp;17N became '''Route&nbsp;2''', which was designated along the portion of Route&nbsp;17N between Route&nbsp;7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. This route was moved to a multilane [[divided highway]] alignment north of Rutherford by 1937. Route&nbsp;2 became Route&nbsp;17 in 1942 to match the designation of NY&nbsp;17 for defense purposes during [[World War II]]. The entire Route&nbsp;17 corridor was once planned to be a [[freeway]] until the 1960s, and later plans to extend the route south of Route&nbsp;3 to [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|I-280]] in 1972 and to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in 1987 both failed. Over the years, the portion of Route&nbsp;17 north of Route&nbsp;3 has seen many improvements, including the widening of much of the road to six lanes and the removal of most at-grade intersections in the 1950s as well as more recent improvements to the interchanges with Route&nbsp;4 in Paramus in 1999 and Essex Street on the [[Lodi, New Jersey|Lodi]]/[[Maywood, New Jersey|Maywood]] border in 2008. The route is currently undergoing improvements between Route&nbsp;3 and US&nbsp;46 and is expected to see improvements from Williams Avenue in Hasbrouck Heights to south of Route&nbsp;4 in Paramus.\n\n==Route description==\n[[Image:2018-07-19 10 17 40 View north along New Jersey State Route 17 (Ridge Road) just north of New Jersey State Route 7 and County Route 507 (Belleville Turnpike) in North Arlington, Bergen County, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|First northbound Route 17 reassurance shield past the southern terminus at Route 7/CR 507 in North Arlington]]Route&nbsp;17 begins at an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 7|Route&nbsp;7]] and [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;507]] (Belleville Turnpike) on the border of [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] and [[North Arlington, New Jersey|North Arlington]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the webtoon, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Other media==\n===Game===\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise. The game drew in 120 million players shortly after its initial release.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the webtoon's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=2015-07-05}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, Tower of God is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the webtoon, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi).

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}\n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}-->\n|}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the webtoon's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=2015-07-05}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, Tower of God is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.
