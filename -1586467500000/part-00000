It was #4 on the [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Dance Charts]] (4 weeks) and won a Billboard Award for Best Selling Latin Song of the Year. The video was nominated for four [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 2003: Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Art Direction.\n\nDeyo's pen and vocal skills went into [[Ginuwine]]'s fourth album entitled ''[[The Senior]]'' with the songs \"Chedda Brings\" a co-write with longtime collaborator Antonio McClendon and \"Big Plans\" which featured [[Method Man]]. Deyo's vocal backgrounds can be heard on each of these records and is credited on the album. mrDEYO also lent his hand and vocal production to [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]]'s only #1 album ''[[After the Storm (Monica album)|After the Storm]]'', which was the long-awaited rerelease of ''[[All Eyez on Me (Monica album)|All Eyez on Me]]''. The song \"Go To Bed Mad\" was a duet featuring label mate [[Tyrese]] (selected by Apple's Larry Jackson and RCA CEO Peter Edge).<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/monica/2935537/lyric.jhtml Go to Bed Mad | Monica | VH1.com]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2004===\nDeyo had another single with [[O'Ryan]] ([[Omarion]]'s look alike little brother) called \"Take It Slow\" . The song was a co-write with Tommy Niblack (who vocal produced with Deyo on \"Go To Bed Mad\"), Makeba Riddick (Woods) (of [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]] fame), and [[Adonis Shropshire]] ([[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] hit writer). A month later he landed a placement with [[Frankee]], famous for her answer back song to [[Eamon (singer)|Eamon]]'s \"[[Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)]]\" called [[F.U.R.B. (Fuck You Right Back)]].

He also worked with Jared Cotter (JL Cotter) on his project \"The Album B4 The Album\" contributing four songs: \"Mo' Thangs\", \"Make U Cry\" feat. Stimuli (co-written with Cotter and Greg Bruno), \"Just Tell Him\", and \"Business & Pleasure\". The project was released on April 21, 2005 in an effort to gain an unknown Cotter more exposure from record labels he sought to be signed by. Deyo would commonly tap Jared to demo his songs @ Sony/ATV Music Studios in New York City and continued to work with him to reach his goal of becoming an artist. In 2007 Jared found success as a top 12 contestant on American Idol (Season 6), then to hosting Fuse Network's \"The Sauce\", and \"The Challenge\" on MSG. In 2009 Cotter co-wrote the Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit / ASCAP Award winner \"Down\" by Cash Money artist Jay Sean as well as the majority of the album.

A regular Gregorian year consists of 365 days, but in certain years known as [[leap year]]s, a [[leap day]] is added to February. Gregorian years are identified by consecutive year numbers.<ref>Clause 3.2.1 [[ISO 8601]]</ref> A calendar date is fully specified by the year (numbered according to a [[calendar era]], in this case ''[[Anno Domini]]'' or [[Common Era]]), the month (identified by name or number), and the day of the month (numbered sequentially starting from 1). Although the calendar year currently runs from 1 January to 31 December, at previous times year numbers were based on a different starting point within the calendar (see the [[#Beginning of the year|\"beginning of the year\"]] section below).\n{{clear}}\n\nIn the [[Julian calendar]], a leap year occurred every 4 years, and the leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February. The Gregorian reform omitted a leap day in three of every 400 years and left the leap day unchanged. However, it has become customary in the [[modern period]] to number the days sequentially with no gaps, and 29 February is typically considered as the leap day. Before the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision of the Roman Calendar]], the Roman Catholic Church delayed February feasts after the 23rd by one day in leap years; Masses celebrated according to the previous calendar still reflect this delay.<ref>Richards 1998, p. 101</ref>\n\nCalendar cycles repeat completely every 400 years, which equals 146,097 days.{{refn|The cycle described applies to the solar, or civil, calendar.

It was instituted by [[papal bull]] ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' dated 24 February 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar is named.<ref name=text /> The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. The error in the Julian calendar (its assumption that there are exactly 365.25 days in a year) had led to the date of the equinox according to the calendar drifting from the observed reality, and thus an error had been introduced into the [[Computus|calculation of the date of Easter]]. Although a recommendation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see [[Easter#Controversies over the date|Easter]] for the issues which arose).<ref group=Note>The last major Christian region to accept the Alexandrian rules was the [[Carolingian Empire]] (most of Western Europe) during 780\u2013800. The last monastery in England to accept the Alexandrian rules did so in 931, and a few churches in southwest Asia beyond the eastern border of the [[Byzantine Empire]] continued to use rules that differed slightly, causing four dates for Easter to differ every 532 years.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nBecause the [[date of Easter]] is a function{{snd}} the ''[[computus]]''{{snd}} of the date of the (northern hemisphere) spring [[equinox]], the [[Catholic Church]] considered unacceptable the increasing divergence between the [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canonical date]] of the equinox and observed reality. Easter is celebrated on the Sunday after the [[ecclesiastical full moon]] on or after 21 March, which was adopted as approximation to the March equinox.<ref>Richards 2013, p. 599.</ref> European scholars had been well aware of the calendar drift since the early medieval period.\n\n[[Bede]], writing in the 8th century, showed that the accumulated error in his time was more than three days. [[Roger Bacon]] in c. 1200 estimated the error at seven or eight days. [[Dante]], writing c. 1300, was aware of the need of a calendar reform. The first attempt to go forward with such a reform was undertaken by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who in 1475 invited [[Regiomontanus]] to the Vatican for this purpose. However, the project was interrupted by the death of Regiomontanus shortly after his arrival in Rome.<ref>\nAri Ben-Menahem, ''Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences'' vol. 1 (2009), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&pg=PA863#v=onepage p. 863].</ref>\nThe increase of astronomical knowledge and the precision of observations towards the end of the 15th century made the question more pressing. Numerous publications over the following decades called for a calendar reform, among them two papers sent to the Vatican by the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1515 and 1578,<ref>Carabias Torres, 2012, p. 241</ref>\nbut the project was not taken up again until the 1540s, and implemented only under [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (r. 1572\u20131585).\n\n===Preparation===\nIn 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] authorized [[Pope Paul III]] to reform the calendar, requiring that the date of the [[vernal equinox]] be restored to that which it held at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and that an alteration to the calendar be designed to prevent future drift. This would allow for a more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of Easter.\n\nIn 1577, a ''Compendium'' was sent to expert mathematicians outside the reform commission for comments. Some of these experts, including [[Giambattista Benedetti]] and [[Giuseppe Moletti|Giuseppe Moleto]], believed Easter should be computed from the true motions of the Sun and Moon, rather than using a tabular method, but these recommendations were not adopted.<ref>Ziggelaar (1983), pp. 211, 214.</ref> The reform adopted was a modification of a proposal made by the [[Calabria]]n doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]] (or Lilio).<ref name=\"Moyer 1983\">Moyer 1983.</ref>\n\nLilius's proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97, by making three out of four centurial years common instead of leap years. He also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the Moon when calculating the annual date of Easter, solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform.\n\nAncient tables provided the Sun's mean longitude.<ref>\n*See, for example,''Tabule illustrissimi principis regis alfonsii'', Prague 1401\u22124 (Latin). A full set of Alphonsine Tables (including tables for mean motions, conjunctions of Sun and Moon, equation of time, spherical astronomy, longitudes and latitudes of cities, star tables, eclipse tables).\n*For an example of the information provided see Jacques Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques du soleil, de la lune, des plan\u00e8tes, des \u00e9toiles fixes, et des satellites de Jupiter et de Saturne'', Paris 1740, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA130] (go forward ten pages to Table III on p. 10).</ref> The German mathematician [[Christopher Clavius]], the architect of the Gregorian calendar, noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the Sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year.

He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the [[Alfonsine tables]] and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (''[[De revolutionibus]]'') and [[Erasmus Reinhold]] (''[[Prutenic tables]]''). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alfonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold). In decimal notation, these are equal to 0.24254606, 0.24255185, and 0.24254352, respectively.  All values are the same to two sexagesimal places (14:33, equal to decimal 0.2425) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year. Thus Pitatus' solution would have commended itself to the astronomers.<ref>Swerdlow (1986).</ref>\n\nLilius's proposals had two components. First, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean [[tropical year]] is 365.24219 days long.<ref>Meeus and Savoie (1992).</ref> A commonly used value in Lilius's time, from the Alfonsine tables, is 365.2425463 days.<ref>Moyer (1983). p.</ref> As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see [[#Accuracy|Accuracy]]). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would have drifted further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.\n\nLilius's work was expanded upon by Christopher Clavius in a closely argued, 800-page volume. He would later defend his and Lilius's work against detractors. Clavius's opinion was that the correction should take place in one move, and it was this advice which prevailed with Gregory.\n\nThe second component consisted of an approximation which would provide an accurate yet simple, rule-based calendar. Lilius's formula was a 10-day correction to revert the drift since the Council of Nicaea, and the imposition of a leap day in only 97 years in 400 rather than in 1 year in 4. The proposed rule was that ''years divisible by 100 would be leap years only if they were divisible by 400 as well''.\n\nThe 19-year cycle used for the lunar calendar was also to be corrected by one day every 300 or 400 years (8 times in 2500 years) along with corrections for the years that are no longer leap years (i.e. 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc.) In fact, a new method for computing the date of Easter was introduced.\n\nWhen the new calendar was put in use, the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the Council of Nicaea was corrected by a deletion of 10 days. The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582 (the cycle of weekdays was not affected).\n{{clear}}\n\n====First printed Gregorian calendar====\n[[File:Reforma Gregoriana del Calendario Juliano.jpg|thumb|\n''Lunario Novo, Secondo la Nuova Riforma della Correttione del l'Anno Riformato da N.S.

The changes that he was proposing were changes to the civil calendar, over which he had no authority. They required adoption by the civil authorities in each country to have legal effect.\n\nThe bull ''Inter gravissimas'' became the law of the Catholic Church in 1582, but it was not recognised by [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], and a few others. Consequently, the days on which Easter and related holidays were celebrated by different Christian Churches again diverged.\n\nOn 29 September 1582, [[Philip II of Spain]] decreed the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |first=Henry |date=1998 |title=Philip of Spain |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wyWourPR5S8C&printsec=frontcover&q=gregorian%20calendar|publisher=Yale University Press |page=248 |isbn=978-0300078008}}</ref> This affected much of Roman Catholic Europe, as Philip was at the time ruler over [[Iberian Union|Spain and Portugal]] as well as [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|much of Italy]]. In these territories, as well as in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} (ruled by [[Anna Jagiellon]]) and in the Papal States, the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull, with Julian Thursday, 4 October 1582, being followed by Gregorian Friday, 15 October 1582. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] followed somewhat later ''de facto'' because of delay in communication.<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.2837 ''\"Pragmatica\" on the Ten Days of the Year''] [[World Digital Library]], the first known South American imprint, produced in 1584 by Antonio Ricardo, of a four-page edict issued by King Philip II of Spain in 1582, decreeing the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.</ref>\n\nMany [[Protestant]] countries initially objected to adopting a Catholic innovation; some Protestants feared the new calendar was part of a plot to return them to the Catholic fold. For example, the British could not bring themselves to adopt the Catholic system explicitly: the Annexe to their [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] established a computation for the date of Easter that achieved the same result as Gregory's rules, without actually referring to him.<ref>24 Geo.

The start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 March and the year number was roughly equivalent to the Hegira year (see [[Rumi calendar]]). As the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of \"escape years\" every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump. From 1 March 1917 the fiscal year became Gregorian, rather than Julian. On 1 January 1926 the use of the Gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in most other countries.\n\n====Adoption of the Gregorian Calendar====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In other countries the customs varied, and the start of the year moved back and forth as fashion and influence from other countries dictated various customs.\n\nNeither the papal bull nor its attached canons explicitly fix such a date, though it is implied by two tables of [[saint]]'s days, one labelled 1582 which ends on 31 December, and another for any full year that begins on 1 January. It also specifies its epact relative to 1 January, in contrast with the Julian calendar, which specified it relative to 22 March. The old date was derived from the Greek system: the earlier ''Supputatio Romana'' specified it relative to 1 January.\n\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Dual dating==\n{{Main|Dual dating}}\n\nDuring the period between 1582, when the first countries adopted the Gregorian calendar, and 1923, when the last European country adopted it, it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the Julian calendar and in the Gregorian calendar, for example, \"10/21 February 1750/51\", where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 January while others were still using some other date. Even before 1582, the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries. Woolley, writing in his biography of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1527\u20131608/9), notes that immediately after 1582 English letter writers \"customarily\" used \"two dates\" on their letters, one OS and one NS.<ref>Benjamin Woolley, ''The Queen's Conjurer: The science and magic of Dr. John Dee, adviser to Queen Elizabeth I'' (New York: Henry Holt, 2001) p. 173</ref>\n\n===Old Style and New Style dates===\n{{Main|Old Style and New Style dates|Dual dating}}\n\n\"Old Style\" (OS) and \"New Style\" (NS) are sometimes added to dates to identify which calendar reference system is used for the date given. In Britain and its colonies, where the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|Calendar Act of 1750]] altered the start of the year,<ref group=Note>In Scotland the legal start of year had been moved to 1 January in 1600 (Mike Spathaky. [http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar]).</ref> and also aligned the British calendar with the Gregorian calendar, there is some confusion as to what these terms mean. They can indicate that the start of the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] has been adjusted to start on 1 January (NS) even though contemporary documents use a different start of year (OS); or to indicate that a date conforms to the Julian calendar (OS), formerly in use in many countries, rather than the Gregorian calendar (NS).<ref name=\"EC-NA\">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/charles_warrant.htm Death warrant of Charles I] web page of the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ UK National Archives].

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 OS (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.\"\n*[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38556/Russia: The October (November) Revolution] Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.\n*Stockton, J.R. [http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/miscdate.htm#Styles Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles] \"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March&nbsp;25th to January&nbsp;1st); and that the 'Leap Year' change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\"</ref>\n\n==Proleptic Gregorian calendar==\n{{Main|Proleptic Gregorian calendar}}\nExtending the Gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction produces [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|a proleptic calendar]], which should be used with some caution. For ordinary purposes, the dates of events occurring prior to 15 October 1582 are generally shown as they appeared in the Julian calendar, with the year starting on 1 January, and no conversion to their Gregorian equivalents. For example, the [[Battle of Agincourt]] is universally considered to have been fought on 25 October 1415 which is [[Crispin|Saint Crispin]]'s Day.\n\nUsually, the mapping of new dates onto old dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events that happened before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. But for the period between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 and its introduction in Britain on 14 September 1752, there can be considerable confusion between events in continental western Europe and in British domains in English language histories.\n\nEvents in continental western Europe are usually reported in English language histories as happening under the Gregorian calendar. For example, the [[Battle of Blenheim]] is always given as 13 August 1704. Confusion occurs when an event affects both. For example, [[William III of England]] set sail from the Netherlands on 11 November 1688 (Gregorian calendar) and arrived at [[Brixham]] in England on 5 November 1688 (Julian calendar).\n\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] seemingly died on exactly the same date (23 April 1616), but Cervantes predeceased Shakespeare by ten days in real time (as Spain used the Gregorian calendar, but Britain used the Julian calendar). This coincidence encouraged [[UNESCO]] to make 23 April the [[World Book and Copyright Day]].\n\nAstronomers avoid this ambiguity by the use of the [[Julian day number]].\n\nFor dates before the year 1, unlike the proleptic Gregorian calendar used in the [[international standard]] [[ISO 8601]], the traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar (like the Julian calendar) does not have a [[year zero|year 0]] and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1, 2, ... both for years AD and BC. Thus the traditional time line is 2 BC, 1 BC, AD 1, and AD 2. ISO 8601 uses astronomical year numbering which includes a year 0 and negative numbers before it. Thus the ISO 8601 time line is {{nowrap|\u22120001}}, 0000, 0001, and 0002.\n\n{{anchor|Month|Months of the year}}\n\n==Months==\nThe Gregorian calendar continued to employ the [[Julian

Using two hands, one may start from either [[pinkie finger|pinkie]] knuckle as January and count across, omitting the space between the [[index finger|index]] knuckles (July and August). The same procedure can be done using the knuckles of a single hand, returning from the last (July) to the first (August) and continuing through. A similar mnemonic is to move up a [[musical keyboard|piano keyboard]] in [[semitone]]s from an F key, taking the white keys as the longer months and the black keys as the shorter ones.\n\n{{anchor|Week}}\n\n==Weeks==\n{{Main|Seven-day week}}\nIn conjunction with the system of months there is a system of [[week]]s. A physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the [[weekday]], and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month. [[Calculating the day of the week]] is not very simple, because of the irregularities in the Gregorian system. When the Gregorian calendar was adopted by each country, the weekly cycle continued uninterrupted. For example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by Gregory XIII for the calendar's adoption, Friday, 15 October 1582, the preceding date was Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian calendar).\n\nOpinions vary about the numbering of the days of the week. [[ISO 8601]], in common use worldwide, starts with Monday=1; printed monthly calendar grids often list Mondays in the first (left) column of dates and Sundays in the last. In North America, the week typically begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\n\n==Accuracy==\nThe Gregorian calendar improves the approximation made by the Julian calendar by skipping three Julian leap days in every 400 years, giving an average year of 365.2425 [[solar time|mean solar days]] long.<ref>Seidelmann (1992), pp. 580\u2013581.</ref> This approximation has an error of about one day per 3,030 years<ref>Using value from Richards (2013, p. 587) for tropical year in mean solar days, the calculation is {{nowrap|1/(365.2425-365.24217)}}</ref> with respect to the current value of the [[mean tropical year]]. However, because of the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], which is not constant, and the movement of the [[perihelion]] (which affects the Earth's orbital speed) the error with respect to the ''astronomical'' vernal equinox is variable; using the average interval between vernal equinoxes near 2000 of 365.24237 days<ref>Meeus and Savoie (1992), p. 42</ref> implies an error closer to 1 day every 7,700 years. By any criterion, the Gregorian calendar is substantially more accurate than the 1 day in 128 years error of the Julian calendar (average year 365.25 days).\n\nIn the 19th century, Sir [[John Herschel]] proposed a modification to the Gregorian calendar with 969 leap days every 4000 years, instead of 970 leap days that the Gregorian calendar would insert over the same period.<ref>John Herschel, [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-94926 ''Outlines of Astronomy''], 1849, p. 629.</ref> This would reduce the average year to 365.24225 days. Herschel's proposal would make the year 4000, and multiples thereof, common instead of leap. While this modification has often been proposed since, it has never been officially adopted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steel, Duncan|title=Marking Time: The Epic Quest to Invent the Perfect Calendar|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-29827-4|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxvVdXyr_hMC&lpg=PA152&pg=PA185#v=onepage}}</ref>\n\nOn time scales of thousands of years, the Gregorian calendar falls behind the astronomical seasons. This is because [[Earth's rotation#Changes|the Earth's speed of rotation is gradually slowing down]], which makes each day slightly longer over time (see [[tidal acceleration]] and [[leap second]]) while the year maintains a more uniform duration.\n\n===Calendar seasonal error===\n[[File:Gregoriancalendarleap solstice.svg|frameless|upright=3.65|Gregorian calendar seasons difference]]\n\nThis image shows the difference between the Gregorian calendar and the astronomical seasons.\n\nThe ''y''-axis is the date in June and the ''x''-axis is Gregorian calendar years.\n\nEach point is the date and time of the [[Solstice|June solstice]] in that particular year. The error shifts by about a quarter of a day per year. Centurial years are ordinary years, unless they are divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years. This causes a correction in the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300.\n\nFor instance, these corrections cause 23 December 1903 to be the latest December solstice, and 20 December 2096 to be the earliest solstice\u2014about 2.35 days of variation compared with the seasonal event.\n\n==Proposed reforms==\nThe following are [[Calendar reform|proposed reforms]] of the Gregorian calendar:\n* [[Holocene calendar]]\n* [[International Fixed Calendar]] (also called the ''International Perpetual calendar'')\n* [[World Calendar]]\n* [[World Season Calendar]]\n* [[Leap week calendar]]s\n** [[Pax Calendar]]\n** [[Symmetry454]]\n** [[Hanke\u2013Henry Permanent Calendar]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n*[[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]]\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n*[[Conversion between Julian and Gregorian calendars]]\n*[[Doomsday rule]]\n*[[French revolutionary calendar]]\n*[[Hebrew calendar]]\n*[[Dionysius Exiguus]]\n*[[s:Translation:Inter gravissimas|Inter gravissimas in English]] \u2013 Wikisource\n*[[Julian day]]\n*[[History of calendars]]\n* [[ISO 8601]], an international standard for the representation of dates and times, which uses the Gregorian calendar (see Section 3.2.1).\n*[[List of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar per country]]\n*[[List of calendars]]\n*[[Old Calendarists]]\n**[[Greek Old Calendarists]]\n*[[Revised Julian calendar]] (Milankovi\u0107) \u2013 used in Eastern Orthodoxy\n'''Precursors of the Gregorian reform'''\n* [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]], ''De Anni Ratione'' (\"On reckoning the years\"), c. 1235\n* [[Roger Bacon]], ''[[Opus Majus]]'' (\"Greater Work\"), c. 1267\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Barsoum, Ignatius A.

A regular Gregorian year consists of 365 days, but in certain years known as [[leap year]]s, a [[leap day]] is added to February. Gregorian years are identified by consecutive year numbers.<ref>Clause 3.2.1 [[ISO 8601]]</ref> A calendar date is fully specified by the year (numbered according to a [[calendar era]], in this case ''[[Anno Domini]]'' or [[Common Era]]), the month (identified by name or number), and the day of the month (numbered sequentially starting from 1). Although the calendar year currently runs from 1 January to 31 December, at previous times year numbers were based on a different starting point within the calendar (see the [[#Beginning of the year|\"beginning of the year\"]] section below).\n{{clear}}\n\nIn the [[Julian calendar]], a leap year occurred every 4 years, and the leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February. The Gregorian reform omitted a leap day in three of every 400 years and left the leap day unchanged. However, it has become customary in the [[modern period]] to number the days sequentially with no gaps, and 29 February is typically considered as the leap day. Before the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision of the Roman Calendar]], the Roman Catholic Church delayed February feasts after the 23rd by one day in leap years; Masses celebrated according to the previous calendar still reflect this delay.<ref>Richards 1998, p. 101</ref>\n\nCalendar cycles repeat completely every 400 years, which equals 146,097 days.{{refn|The cycle described applies to the solar, or civil, calendar.

It was instituted by [[papal bull]] ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' dated 24 February 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar is named.<ref name=text /> The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. The error in the Julian calendar (its assumption that there are exactly 365.25 days in a year) had led to the date of the equinox according to the calendar drifting from the observed reality, and thus an error had been introduced into the [[Computus|calculation of the date of Easter]]. Although a recommendation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see [[Easter#Controversies over the date|Easter]] for the issues which arose).<ref group=Note>The last major Christian region to accept the Alexandrian rules was the [[Carolingian Empire]] (most of Western Europe) during 780\u2013800. The last monastery in England to accept the Alexandrian rules did so in 931, and a few churches in southwest Asia beyond the eastern border of the [[Byzantine Empire]] continued to use rules that differed slightly, causing four dates for Easter to differ every 532 years.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nBecause the [[date of Easter]] is a function{{snd}} the ''[[computus]]''{{snd}} of the date of the (northern hemisphere) spring [[equinox]], the [[Catholic Church]] considered unacceptable the increasing divergence between the [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canonical date]] of the equinox and observed reality. Easter is celebrated on the Sunday after the [[ecclesiastical full moon]] on or after 21 March, which was adopted as approximation to the March equinox.<ref>Richards 2013, p. 599.</ref> European scholars had been well aware of the calendar drift since the early medieval period.\n\n[[Bede]], writing in the 8th century, showed that the accumulated error in his time was more than three days. [[Roger Bacon]] in c. 1200 estimated the error at seven or eight days. [[Dante]], writing c. 1300, was aware of the need of a calendar reform. The first attempt to go forward with such a reform was undertaken by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who in 1475 invited [[Regiomontanus]] to the Vatican for this purpose. However, the project was interrupted by the death of Regiomontanus shortly after his arrival in Rome.<ref>\nAri Ben-Menahem, ''Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences'' vol. 1 (2009), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&pg=PA863#v=onepage p. 863].</ref>\nThe increase of astronomical knowledge and the precision of observations towards the end of the 15th century made the question more pressing. Numerous publications over the following decades called for a calendar reform, among them two papers sent to the Vatican by the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1515 and 1578,<ref>Carabias Torres, 2012, p. 241</ref>\nbut the project was not taken up again until the 1540s, and implemented only under [[Pope Gregory XIII]] (r. 1572\u20131585).\n\n===Preparation===\nIn 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] authorized [[Pope Paul III]] to reform the calendar, requiring that the date of the [[vernal equinox]] be restored to that which it held at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and that an alteration to the calendar be designed to prevent future drift. This would allow for a more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of Easter.\n\nIn 1577, a ''Compendium'' was sent to expert mathematicians outside the reform commission for comments. Some of these experts, including [[Giambattista Benedetti]] and [[Giuseppe Moletti|Giuseppe Moleto]], believed Easter should be computed from the true motions of the Sun and Moon, rather than using a tabular method, but these recommendations were not adopted.<ref>Ziggelaar (1983), pp. 211, 214.</ref> The reform adopted was a modification of a proposal made by the [[Calabria]]n doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]] (or Lilio).<ref name=\"Moyer 1983\">Moyer 1983.</ref>\n\nLilius's proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97, by making three out of four centurial years common instead of leap years. He also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the Moon when calculating the annual date of Easter, solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform.\n\nAncient tables provided the Sun's mean longitude.<ref>\n*See, for example,''Tabule illustrissimi principis regis alfonsii'', Prague 1401\u22124 (Latin).

He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the [[Alfonsine tables]] and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (''[[De revolutionibus]]'') and [[Erasmus Reinhold]] (''[[Prutenic tables]]''). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alfonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold). In decimal notation, these are equal to 0.24254606, 0.24255185, and 0.24254352, respectively.  All values are the same to two sexagesimal places (14:33, equal to decimal 0.2425) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year. Thus Pitatus' solution would have commended itself to the astronomers.<ref>Swerdlow (1986).</ref>\n\nLilius's proposals had two components. First, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean [[tropical year]] is 365.24219 days long.<ref>Meeus and Savoie (1992).</ref> A commonly used value in Lilius's time, from the Alfonsine tables, is 365.2425463 days.<ref>Moyer (1983). p.</ref> As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see [[#Accuracy|Accuracy]]). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would have drifted further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.\n\nLilius's work was expanded upon by Christopher Clavius in a closely argued, 800-page volume. He would later defend his and Lilius's work against detractors. Clavius's opinion was that the correction should take place in one move, and it was this advice which prevailed with Gregory.\n\nThe second component consisted of an approximation which would provide an accurate yet simple, rule-based calendar. Lilius's formula was a 10-day correction to revert the drift since the Council of Nicaea, and the imposition of a leap day in only 97 years in 400 rather than in 1 year in 4. The proposed rule was that ''years divisible by 100 would be leap years only if they were divisible by 400 as well''.\n\nThe 19-year cycle used for the lunar calendar was also to be corrected by one day every 300 or 400 years (8 times in 2500 years) along with corrections for the years that are no longer leap years (i.e. 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc.) In fact, a new method for computing the date of Easter was introduced.\n\nWhen the new calendar was put in use, the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the Council of Nicaea was corrected by a deletion of 10 days. The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582 (the cycle of weekdays was not affected).\n{{clear}}\n\n====First printed Gregorian calendar====\n[[File:Reforma Gregoriana del Calendario Juliano.jpg|thumb|\n''Lunario Novo, Secondo la Nuova Riforma della Correttione del l'Anno Riformato da N.S.

Consequently, the days on which Easter and related holidays were celebrated by different Christian Churches again diverged.\n\nOn 29 September 1582, [[Philip II of Spain]] decreed the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |first=Henry |date=1998 |title=Philip of Spain |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wyWourPR5S8C&printsec=frontcover&q=gregorian%20calendar|publisher=Yale University Press |page=248 |isbn=978-0300078008}}</ref> This affected much of Roman Catholic Europe, as Philip was at the time ruler over [[Iberian Union|Spain and Portugal]] as well as [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|much of Italy]]. In these territories, as well as in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} (ruled by [[Anna Jagiellon]]) and in the Papal States, the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull, with Julian Thursday, 4 October 1582, being followed by Gregorian Friday, 15 October 1582.

The start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 March and the year number was roughly equivalent to the Hegira year (see [[Rumi calendar]]). As the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of \"escape years\" every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump. From 1 March 1917 the fiscal year became Gregorian, rather than Julian. On 1 January 1926 the use of the Gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in most other countries.\n\n====Adoption of the Gregorian Calendar====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Gregorian calendar was used in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the 16th century by the Catholic population and was formally adopted for government use in 1878 following occupation by Austria-Hungary.</ref>\n|-\n| 1923\n| Greece\n|-\n| 1926\n| Turkey\n|-\n| 2016\n| Saudi Arabia\n|}\n\n==Difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Conversion from Julian to Gregorian dates.<ref>A more extensive list is available at [[Conversion between Julian and Gregorian calendars]]</ref>\n!

The Gregorian calendar is [[Proleptic calendar|proleptic]] before 1582 (assumed to exist before 1582), and the difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates increases by three days every four centuries (all date ranges are inclusive).\n\nThe following equation gives the number of days (actually, dates) that the Gregorian calendar is ahead of the Julian calendar, called the ''secular difference'' between the two calendars. A negative difference means the Julian calendar is ahead of the Gregorian calendar.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens (1999), p. 788.</ref>\n:<math>D = \\left\\lfloor{Y/100}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor{Y/400}\\right\\rfloor - 2</math>\nwhere <math>D</math> is the secular difference and <math>Y</math> is the year using [[astronomical year numbering]], that is, use {{nowrap|(year BC) \u2212 1}} for BC years. <math>\\left\\lfloor{x}\\right\\rfloor</math> means that if the result of the division is not an integer it is rounded down to the nearest integer. Thus during the 1900s, 1900/400 = 4, while during the \u2212500s, \u2212500/400 = \u22122.\n\nThe general rule, in years which are leap years in the Julian calendar but not the Gregorian, is:\n\nUp to 28 February in the calendar being converted {{em|from}}, add one day less or subtract one day more than the calculated value. Give February the appropriate number of days for the calendar being converted {{em|into}}. When subtracting days to calculate the Gregorian equivalent of 29 February (Julian), 29 February is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is \u22124 the Gregorian equivalent of this date is 24 February.<ref>\n*James Evans, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&pg=PA169 The history and practice of ancient astronomy]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998) 169. {{ISBN|0-19-509539-1}}.\n*''Explanatory Supplement to The Astronomical Ephemeris and The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1961) 417.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Beginning of the year==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n!

For example, Scotland changed the start of the Scottish New Year to 1 January in 1600 (this means that 1599 was a short year). England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of the year to 1 January in 1752 (so 1751 was a short year with only 282 days) though in England the start of the tax year remained at 25 March (O.S.), 5 April (N.S.) until 1800, when it moved to 6 April. Later in 1752 in September the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies (see the section [[#Adoption|Adoption]]). These two reforms were implemented by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]].<ref name=\"NT-Perpetual-Calendar\">N\u00f8rby, Toke. [http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.php The Perpetual Calendar]</ref>\n\nIn some countries, an official decree or law specified that the start of the year should be 1 January. For such countries a specific year when a 1 January-year became the norm can be identified. In other countries the customs varied, and the start of the year moved back and forth as fashion and influence from other countries dictated various customs.\n\nNeither the papal bull nor its attached canons explicitly fix such a date, though it is implied by two tables of [[saint]]'s days, one labelled 1582 which ends on 31 December, and another for any full year that begins on 1 January. It also specifies its epact relative to 1 January, in contrast with the Julian calendar, which specified it relative to 22 March. The old date was derived from the Greek system: the earlier ''Supputatio Romana'' specified it relative to 1 January.\n\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Dual dating==\n{{Main|Dual dating}}\n\nDuring the period between 1582, when the first countries adopted the Gregorian calendar, and 1923, when the last European country adopted it, it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the Julian calendar and in the Gregorian calendar, for example, \"10/21 February 1750/51\", where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 January while others were still using some other date. Even before 1582, the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries. Woolley, writing in his biography of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1527\u20131608/9), notes that immediately after 1582 English letter writers \"customarily\" used \"two dates\" on their letters, one OS and one NS.<ref>Benjamin Woolley, ''The Queen's Conjurer: The science and magic of Dr. John Dee, adviser to Queen Elizabeth I'' (New York: Henry Holt, 2001) p. 173</ref>\n\n===Old Style and New Style dates===\n{{Main|Old Style and New Style dates|Dual dating}}\n\n\"Old Style\" (OS) and \"New Style\" (NS) are sometimes added to dates to identify which calendar reference system is used for the date given. In Britain and its colonies, where the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|Calendar Act of 1750]] altered the start of the year,<ref group=Note>In Scotland the legal start of year had been moved to 1 January in 1600 (Mike Spathaky. [http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar]).</ref> and also aligned the British calendar with the Gregorian calendar, there is some confusion as to what these terms mean. They can indicate that the start of the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] has been adjusted to start on 1 January (NS) even though contemporary documents use a different start of year (OS); or to indicate that a date conforms to the Julian calendar (OS), formerly in use in many countries, rather than the Gregorian calendar (NS).<ref name=\"EC-NA\">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/charles_warrant.htm Death warrant of Charles I] web page of the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ UK National Archives].

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 OS (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.\"\n*[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38556/Russia: The October (November) Revolution] Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.\n*Stockton, J.R.

I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March&nbsp;25th to January&nbsp;1st); and that the 'Leap Year' change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\"</ref>\n\n==Proleptic Gregorian calendar==\n{{Main|Proleptic Gregorian calendar}}\nExtending the Gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction produces [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|a proleptic calendar]], which should be used with some caution. For ordinary purposes, the dates of events occurring prior to 15 October 1582 are generally shown as they appeared in the Julian calendar, with the year starting on 1 January, and no conversion to their Gregorian equivalents. For example, the [[Battle of Agincourt]] is universally considered to have been fought on 25 October 1415 which is [[Crispin|Saint Crispin]]'s Day.\n\nUsually, the mapping of new dates onto old dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events that happened before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. But for the period between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 and its introduction in Britain on 14 September 1752, there can be considerable confusion between events in continental western Europe and in British domains in English language histories.\n\nEvents in continental western Europe are usually reported in English language histories as happening under the Gregorian calendar. For example, the [[Battle of Blenheim]] is always given as 13 August 1704. Confusion occurs when an event affects both. For example, [[William III of England]] set sail from the Netherlands on 11 November 1688 (Gregorian calendar) and arrived at [[Brixham]] in England on 5 November 1688 (Julian calendar).\n\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] seemingly died on exactly the same date (23 April 1616), but Cervantes predeceased Shakespeare by ten days in real time (as Spain used the Gregorian calendar, but Britain used the Julian calendar). This coincidence encouraged [[UNESCO]] to make 23 April the [[World Book and Copyright Day]].\n\nAstronomers avoid this ambiguity by the use of the [[Julian day number]].\n\nFor dates before the year 1, unlike the proleptic Gregorian calendar used in the [[international standard]] [[ISO 8601]], the traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar (like the Julian calendar) does not have a [[year zero|year 0]] and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1, 2, ... both for years AD and BC. Thus the traditional time line is 2 BC, 1 BC, AD 1, and AD 2. ISO 8601 uses astronomical year numbering which includes a year 0 and negative numbers before it. Thus the ISO 8601 time line is {{nowrap|\u22120001}}, 0000, 0001, and 0002.\n\n{{anchor|Month|Months of the year}}\n\n==Months==\nThe Gregorian calendar continued to employ the [[Julian

Using two hands, one may start from either [[pinkie finger|pinkie]] knuckle as January and count across, omitting the space between the [[index finger|index]] knuckles (July and August). The same procedure can be done using the knuckles of a single hand, returning from the last (July) to the first (August) and continuing through. A similar mnemonic is to move up a [[musical keyboard|piano keyboard]] in [[semitone]]s from an F key, taking the white keys as the longer months and the black keys as the shorter ones.\n\n{{anchor|Week}}\n\n==Weeks==\n{{Main|Seven-day week}}\nIn conjunction with the system of months there is a system of [[week]]s. A physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the [[weekday]], and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month. [[Calculating the day of the week]] is not very simple, because of the irregularities in the Gregorian system. When the Gregorian calendar was adopted by each country, the weekly cycle continued uninterrupted. For example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by Gregory XIII for the calendar's adoption, Friday, 15 October 1582, the preceding date was Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian calendar).\n\nOpinions vary about the numbering of the days of the week. [[ISO 8601]], in common use worldwide, starts with Monday=1; printed monthly calendar grids often list Mondays in the first (left) column of dates and Sundays in the last. In North America, the week typically begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\n\n==Accuracy==\nThe Gregorian calendar improves the approximation made by the Julian calendar by skipping three Julian leap days in every 400 years, giving an average year of 365.2425 [[solar time|mean solar days]] long.<ref>Seidelmann (1992), pp. 580\u2013581.</ref> This approximation has an error of about one day per 3,030 years<ref>Using value from Richards (2013, p. 587) for tropical year in mean solar days, the calculation is {{nowrap|1/(365.2425-365.24217)}}</ref> with respect to the current value of the [[mean tropical year]]. However, because of the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], which is not constant, and the movement of the [[perihelion]] (which affects the Earth's orbital speed) the error with respect to the ''astronomical'' vernal equinox is variable; using the average interval between vernal equinoxes near 2000 of 365.24237 days<ref>Meeus and Savoie (1992), p. 42</ref> implies an error closer to 1 day every 7,700 years. By any criterion, the Gregorian calendar is substantially more accurate than the 1 day in 128 years error of the Julian calendar (average year 365.25 days).\n\nIn the 19th century, Sir [[John Herschel]] proposed a modification to the Gregorian calendar with 969 leap days every 4000 years, instead of 970 leap days that the Gregorian calendar would insert over the same period.<ref>John Herschel, [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-94926 ''Outlines of Astronomy''], 1849, p. 629.</ref> This would reduce the average year to 365.24225 days. Herschel's proposal would make the year 4000, and multiples thereof, common instead of leap. While this modification has often been proposed since, it has never been officially adopted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steel, Duncan|title=Marking Time: The Epic Quest to Invent the Perfect Calendar|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-29827-4|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxvVdXyr_hMC&lpg=PA152&pg=PA185#v=onepage}}</ref>\n\nOn time scales of thousands of years, the Gregorian calendar falls behind the astronomical seasons. This is because [[Earth's rotation#Changes|the Earth's speed of rotation is gradually slowing down]], which makes each day slightly longer over time (see [[tidal acceleration]] and [[leap second]]) while the year maintains a more uniform duration.\n\n===Calendar seasonal error===\n[[File:Gregoriancalendarleap solstice.svg|frameless|upright=3.65|Gregorian calendar seasons difference]]\n\nThis image shows the difference between the Gregorian calendar and the astronomical seasons.\n\nThe ''y''-axis is the date in June and the ''x''-axis is Gregorian calendar years.\n\nEach point is the date and time of the [[Solstice|June solstice]] in that particular year. The error shifts by about a quarter of a day per year. Centurial years are ordinary years, unless they are divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years. This causes a correction in the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300.\n\nFor instance, these corrections cause 23 December 1903 to be the latest December solstice, and 20 December 2096 to be the earliest solstice\u2014about 2.35 days of variation compared with the seasonal event.\n\n==Proposed reforms==\nThe following are [[Calendar reform|proposed reforms]] of the Gregorian calendar:\n* [[Holocene calendar]]\n* [[International Fixed Calendar]] (also called the ''International Perpetual calendar'')\n* [[World Calendar]]\n* [[World Season Calendar]]\n* [[Leap week calendar]]s\n** [[Pax Calendar]]\n** [[Symmetry454]]\n** [[Hanke\u2013Henry Permanent Calendar]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n*[[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]]\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n*[[Conversion between Julian and Gregorian calendars]]\n*[[Doomsday rule]]\n*[[French revolutionary calendar]]\n*[[Hebrew calendar]]\n*[[Dionysius Exiguus]]\n*[[s:Translation:Inter gravissimas|Inter gravissimas in English]] \u2013 Wikisource\n*[[Julian day]]\n*[[History of calendars]]\n* [[ISO 8601]], an international standard for the representation of dates and times, which uses the Gregorian calendar (see Section 3.2.1).\n*[[List of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar per country]]\n*[[List of calendars]]\n*[[Old Calendarists]]\n**[[Greek Old Calendarists]]\n*[[Revised Julian calendar]] (Milankovi\u0107) \u2013 used in Eastern Orthodoxy\n'''Precursors of the Gregorian reform'''\n* [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]], ''De Anni Ratione'' (\"On reckoning the years\"), c. 1235\n* [[Roger Bacon]], ''[[Opus Majus]]'' (\"Greater Work\"), c. 1267\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Barsoum, Ignatius A.

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

In 1355, emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] gave it to the Genoese adventurer [[Francesco I Gattilusio|Francesco Gattilusio]], who married the emperor's sister, Maria.  They renovated the fortress in 1373, and it remained in Genoese hands until 1462, when it was [[Ottoman conquest of Lesbos#Siege|besieged and captured]] by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].\n\nMytilene along with the rest of Lesbos remained under Ottoman control until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, when in November it became part of the [[Kingdom of Greece]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{wide image|Panorama Mytilini.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|View of the seafront}}\n\nMytilene is located in the southeastern part of the island, north and east of the Bay of Gera.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but the next day in the [[Mytilenian Debate]] changed its mind. A fast [[trireme]] sailed the {{convert|186|nmi|km}} in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the general massacre, but a thousand citizens were executed for taking part in the rebellion.\n\n[[Aristotle]] lived on Mytilene for two years, 337\u2013335 BC, with his friend and successor, [[Theophrastus]] (a native of the island), after being the tutor to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], son of King [[Philip II of Macedon]].<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/theophrastus.html Bio of Theophrastus] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_aristotle.html Grade Saver bio on Aristotle] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><!---but not Alexander the Great just yet.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|Diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles.

The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16.\nInvestigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine\u2019s gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine\u2019s liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn June 19th, 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure.\nOfficials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on July 7th, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\".

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|Diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market. During its maiden flight on 14 February 1996 carrying the [[Intelsat 708]] satellite, the rocket suffered a guidance failure two seconds into the flight and destroyed a nearby town, killing at least six people,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/coxreport/body/ch6bod.html |title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral |accessdate=23 May 2012 |author=Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=3 January 1999|work=U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China}}</ref> but outside estimates suggest that anywhere between 200 and 500 people might have been killed.<ref name=ChenLan>{{cite web|last=Lan|first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2323/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> However, the author of the report<ref name=\"ChenLan\"/> later ruled out large casualties, because evidence suggest that the crash site was evacuated before the launch.<ref name=ChenLan2>{{cite web|last=Lan|first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster (part 2)|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2326/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Long March 3B and 3B/E rockets conducted ten successful launches between 1997 and 2008.<ref name=\"cgwic.com\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the [[Agila 2]] satellite was forced to use onboard propellant to reach its correct orbit because of poor injection accuracy on the part of its Long March 3B launch vehicle.<ref>''International reference guide to space launch systems''.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles.
