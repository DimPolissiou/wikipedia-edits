Before DNA testing became available, measurement of serum [[calcitonin]] was the most important laboratory test for MEN2B.  Calcitonin is produced by the \"C\" cells of the thyroid, which, because they are always hyperplastic or malignant in MEN2B, produce more calcitonin than normal.  Calcitonin levels remain a valuable marker to detect recurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma after thyroidectomy.\n\n[[Luxol fast blue]] staining identifies [[myelin|myelin sheathing]] of some fibers, and lesional cells react immunohistochemically for S-100 protein, collagen type IV, vimentin, NSE, and neural filaments.

Nevertheless it has repeatedly endorsed the Belt-and-Road Initiative and cooperated in related projects. The motivation is a quest for global relevance, and the strengthening of economic ties with BRI recipients. Furthermore there is a strategic defensive factor: making sure the China is not the single dominant factor in Asian economics.<ref>Irene Chan, \"Reversing China\u2019s Belt-and-Road Initiative\u2014Singapore\u2019s Response to the BRI and Its Quest for Relevance.\" ''East Asia'' 36.3 (2019): 185-204.</ref>\n\nAlthough the '''Philippines''' historically has been closely tied to the United States, China has sought its support for the BRI in terms of the quest for dominance in the South China Sea.

Philippines President [[Rodrigo Roa Duterte]] has reversed his predecessors policy of resisting Chinese expansion. He calculates that this will be the economically more beneficial route, expecting a sort of revival of old maritime silk route, and will support his plans for massive infrastructure expansion.<ref>Renato Cruz De Castro,  \"China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Duterte Administration\u2019s Appeasement Policy: Examining the Connection Between the Two National Strategies.\" ''East Asia'' 36.3 (2019): 205-227.</ref>\n\n==== Arab countries ====\nIn April 2019 and during the second Arab Forum on Reform and Development, China engaged in an array of partnerships called \"Build the Belt and Road, Share Development and Prosperity\" with 18 Arab countries.

Many further areas of commerce are being involved nowadays; ports in [[Oman]], factories in [[Algeria]], skyscrapers in [[Egypt]]'s new capital, etc. China is interested in providing financial security to those countries, who after many Arab wars and American interventions, live off the U.S support. On the one hand, Arab countries gain independence and on the other, China opens the door of a colossal market. As the president of [[Lebanon]] [[Michel Aoun]] stated, \"We regard China as a good friend and are willing to further consolidate the relationship with China.

More than half the continent has already signed partnerships with the Middle Kingdom.

Nevertheless it has repeatedly endorsed the Belt-and-Road Initiative and cooperated in related projects. The motivation is a quest for global relevance, and the strengthening of economic ties with BRI recipients. Furthermore there is a strategic defensive factor: making sure the China is not the single dominant factor in Asian economics.<ref>Irene Chan, \"Reversing China\u2019s Belt-and-Road Initiative\u2014Singapore\u2019s Response to the BRI and Its Quest for Relevance.\" ''East Asia'' 36.3 (2019): 185-204.</ref>\n\nAlthough the '''Philippines''' historically has been closely tied to the United States, China has sought its support for the BRI in terms of the quest for dominance in the South China Sea.

The amount of trade between the two entities has grown almost ten-fold over the last 10 years. That is because China does not see the Middle East as their 'petrol station' anymore. Many further areas of commerce are being involved nowadays; ports in [[Oman]], factories in [[Algeria]], skyscrapers in [[Egypt]]'s new capital, etc. China is interested in providing financial security to those countries, who after many Arab wars and American interventions, live off the U.S support. On the one hand, Arab countries gain independence and on the other, China opens the door of a colossal market. As the president of [[Lebanon]] [[Michel Aoun]] stated, \"We regard China as a good friend and are willing to further consolidate the relationship with China. We would like to draw the experience from China\u2019s reform and development so as to benefit our people and seek our opportunities for development\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/04/opinion/bri-transforming-world-economic-order/|title=Asia Times {{!}} BRI transforming world economic order {{!}} Opinion|last=Times|first=Asia|website=Asia Times|date=25 April 2019|language=en|access-date=23 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509173856/https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/04/opinion/bri-transforming-world-economic-order/|archive-date=9 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An additional advantage on China's part is that it plays a neutral role on the level of diplomacy.

More than half the continent has already signed partnerships with the Middle Kingdom.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, had assembled around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose army was necessary to mount a campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nOver the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, had assembled around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it would be weak and easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] had declared himself unable to join a Royalist march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles with too few troops to contemplate a campaign against London.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nOver the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. When Canada's best players (from the [[National Hockey League]]) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the [[Czech national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] won gold and the team fell to [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the bronze medal game. Canada finally won its first hockey gold in 50 years in Salt Lake City in 2002, sparking national celebrations.  \n\nThe 2010 games were the first Olympics to take place in an NHL market since the league's players started to compete in the games, as Vancouver is home to the [[Vancouver Canucks]].\n\nWomen's ice hockey was introduced at the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano Olympics]] in 1998, with [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canada]] winning the silver medal. [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canada]] has appeared in every Olympic gold medal game, facing the United States five times (1998, 2002, 2010, 2014, 2018) and [[Sweden women's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] once (2006). Canada has topped the podium four times (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014), taking silver against the United States twice (1998, 2018).\n\n{{See also|Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada women's national ice hockey team}}\n{{Medals table\n | caption     = \n | team        = Games\n | hide_rank   = yes\n | leading     = \n | gold_1  = 1  | silver_1  = 0  | bronze_1  = 0  | name_1  = [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp]] | host_1 = yes \n | gold_2  = 1  | silver_2  = 0  | bronze_2  = 0  | name_2  = [[Ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924 Chamonix]]\n | gold_3  = 1  | silver_3  = 0  | bronze_3  = 0  | name_3  = [[Ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928 St. Moritz]]\n | gold_4  = 1  | silver_4  = 0  | bronze_4  = 0  | name_4  = [[Ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932 Lake Placid]]\n | gold_5  = 0  | silver_5  = 1  | bronze_5  = 0  | name_5  = [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]\n | gold_6  = 1  | silver_6  = 0  | bronze_6  = 0  | name_6  = [[Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948 St. Moritz]]\n | gold_7  = 1  | silver_7  = 0  | bronze_7  = 0  | name_7  = [[Ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics|1952 Oslo]]\n | gold_8  = 0  | silver_8  = 0  | bronze_8  = 1  | name_8  = [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo]]\n | gold_9  = 0  | silver_9  = 1  | bronze_9  = 0  | name_9  = [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Squaw Valley]]\n | gold_10 = 0  | silver_10 = 0  | bronze_10 = 1  | name_10 = [[Ice hockey at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968 Grenoble]]\n | gold_11 = 0  | silver_11 = 1  | bronze_11 = 0  | name_11 = [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville]]\n | gold_12 = 0  | silver_12 = 1  | bronze_12 = 0  | name_12 = [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Lillehammer]]\n | gold_13 = 0  | silver_13 = 1  | bronze_13 = 0  | name_13 = [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano]]\n | gold_14 = 2  | silver_14 = 0  | bronze_14 = 0  | name_14 = [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Salt Lake City]]\n | gold_15 = 1  | silver_15 = 0  | bronze_15 = 0  | name_15 = [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Turin]]\n | gold_16 = 2  | silver_16 = 0  | bronze_16 = 0  | name_16 = [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver]]\n | gold_17 = 2  | silver_17 = 0  | bronze_17 = 0  | name_17 = [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi]]\n | gold_18 = 0  | silver_18 = 1  | bronze_18 = 1  | name_18 = [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Pyeongchang]]\n}}\nNote: Ice hockey was part of the Summer Olympic program for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 games in Antwerp]], but is listed here for completeness.

The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. When Canada's best players (from the [[National Hockey League]]) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the [[Czech national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] won gold and the team fell to [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the bronze medal game.

Its entire course, some 700 meters, is in the southern direction. It receives a short ''Pajsijeva'' street from the right and then crosses the ''Kraljice Natalije'' street, where it leaves the municipality of Stari Grad and enters Savski Venac. It then receives the ''Lomina'' street from the right and passes through the intersection where it crosses the streets of ''Gavrila Principa'', ''Admirala Geprata'' and ''Milovana Milovanovi\u0107a''. It ends at the meeting with the [[Nemanjina Street]], though its natural extension is the ''Hajduk Veljkov Venac'' and further, ''Sarajevska'' street.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beograd - plan grada|date=2006|publisher=M@gic M@p|isbn=86-83501-53-1}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe street was constructed in 1872, when it got its name it still bears today. Originally, it was routed as a connection between the ''Abad\u017eijska'' (modern ''Kraljice Natalije'') and ''Savamalska'' (modern ''Gavrila Principa'' streets. This entire section of the city was projected by the Viennese architect Franz Janke. First proper building in the street was built in 1876, at the corner with the ''Abad\u017eijska''. In 1885, a tailor (''abad\u017eija'') \u0110or\u0111e Arsenijevi\u0107 opened his tailor store in that building and placed a plastered relief of a scissors on the building's front fa\u00e7ade. As it was prolongued on both sides, it became the direct, and shortest, connection between downtown and [[Savamala]], on the bank of the [[Sava|Sava river]]. In the 19th century, Balkanska was famous for its artisan shops: tailors, waxers, ''[[Opanak|opan\u010dari]]'', quilters. In the 20th century it became known for the food, as a location of some of the best pastries in Belgrade, especially known for its ice-creams and [[halva]]. At the top of the street one of the first fast-food facilities in Belgrade was open, \"Leskov\u010danin\", which used to sell ''[[Pljeskavica|Leskova\u010dka pljeskavica]]''.<ref name=\"b92\">{{cite web|url= http://www.b92.net/putovanja/destinacije/evropa.php?&nav_id=468720|author=|title= Balkanska - zanatlijska ulica|date=29 December 2010|publisher=[[B92]]|language=Serbian}}</ref> In general, Balkanska was a place where you could buy almost any type of goods. Today, only few of the old craftsman's shops survived, like pastry shops and bakeries, but as of 2015, the tanner shop, hat maker or purse tailor can still be found in the street.<ref name=\"Politika\">{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Branka Vasiljevi\u0107| title = Balkanska - lepotica izboranog lica| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 8 February 2015| url = }}</ref>\n\nSome of the oldest, still operational shops are bakery \"An\u0111elko\" (est. 1920), purse tailor \"Zlatko\" (est. 1946) and hatter \"Kapa Rade\" (est. c.1949).<ref name=rok/> In the 1960s, the street was known for the illegal street traders who were selling \"the best English fabrics\".<ref>{{cite news | author = Milo\u0161 Lazi\u0107 | script-title=sr: \u041f\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0446\u0435 - \u0421\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0452\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0437\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0430 | trans-title = Farmers markets - Village among market stalls | newspaper = Politika-Magazin, No. 1156 | page = 22 | language = Serbian | date = 24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn order the preserve the craftsmanship for which the street was known, city government announced in July 2017 the project of adapting the ''Balkanska'' into the \"street of the old crafts\", not only as a tourist attraction but as a way of keeping the \"spirit of Belgrade\".<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author =Branka Vasiljevi\u0107  | title = Obnovljena Skadarlijska \u010desma | newspaper = Politika | pages = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 8 July 2017 | url = }}</ref> In April 2018 it was announced that the small shops in the street will be reconstructed, the fa\u00e7ades will be renovated and those which are empty will be offered to the artisans from other parts of the city.<ref>{{ cite news | author = Ana Vukovi\u0107 | title = Balkanska - ulica starih zanata | trans-title = Balkanska - street of old crafts | newspaper = Politika | page = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 4 May 2018 }}</ref> The reconstruction began on 10 July 2018 and is expected to last until 15 October.<ref name=rekon/> The [[asphalt concrete]] will be removed from the street completely and replaced with the stone slabs on the sidewalks while the street itself will be paved with cobblestone, like it was before.

City promised that it will not charge the rent to those shops which are renting the government and city owned facilities and that entrepreneurs will be free of paying taxes during the extended reconstruction, however several artisan shops were closed.<ref name=rok/>\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMajor physical feature, by which Balkanska is best known, is its continual steepness, from the beginning to the end. It connects central city plateau, located on the top of Terazije ridge, with the Sava bank and Savamala neighborhood.

Its entire course, some 700 meters, is in the southern direction. It receives a short ''Pajsijeva'' street from the right and then crosses the ''Kraljice Natalije'' street, where it leaves the municipality of Stari Grad and enters Savski Venac. It then receives the ''Lomina'' street from the right and passes through the intersection where it crosses the streets of ''Gavrila Principa'', ''Admirala Geprata'' and ''Milovana Milovanovi\u0107a''. It ends at the meeting with the [[Nemanjina Street]], though its natural extension is the ''Hajduk Veljkov Venac'' and further, ''Sarajevska'' street.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beograd - plan grada|date=2006|publisher=M@gic M@p|isbn=86-83501-53-1}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe street was constructed in 1872, when it got its name it still bears today. Originally, it was routed as a connection between the ''Abad\u017eijska'' (modern ''Kraljice Natalije'') and ''Savamalska'' (modern ''Gavrila Principa'' streets. This entire section of the city was projected by the Viennese architect Franz Janke. First proper building in the street was built in 1876, at the corner with the ''Abad\u017eijska''. In 1885, a tailor (''abad\u017eija'') \u0110or\u0111e Arsenijevi\u0107 opened his tailor store in that building and placed a plastered relief of a scissors on the building's front fa\u00e7ade. As it was prolongued on both sides, it became the direct, and shortest, connection between downtown and [[Savamala]], on the bank of the [[Sava|Sava river]]. In the 19th century, Balkanska was famous for its artisan shops: tailors, waxers, ''[[Opanak|opan\u010dari]]'', quilters. In the 20th century it became known for the food, as a location of some of the best pastries in Belgrade, especially known for its ice-creams and [[halva]]. At the top of the street one of the first fast-food facilities in Belgrade was open, \"Leskov\u010danin\", which used to sell ''[[Pljeskavica|Leskova\u010dka pljeskavica]]''.<ref name=\"b92\">{{cite web|url= http://www.b92.net/putovanja/destinacije/evropa.php?&nav_id=468720|author=|title= Balkanska - zanatlijska ulica|date=29 December 2010|publisher=[[B92]]|language=Serbian}}</ref> In general, Balkanska was a place where you could buy almost any type of goods.
