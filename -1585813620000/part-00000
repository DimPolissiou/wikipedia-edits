It is known for its very large physical paper format ([[aspect ratio (newspaper)|Nordisch]]) and its long and detailed articles.\n\n== Print edition ==\n\n=== Sections and supplements ===\nThe ''Zeit'' is divided into different sections. Some of which are:\n* Politik (''English: politics'')\n* Streit (''English literally: fight'')\n* Dossier (''English: dossier)\n* Geschichte (''English: history'')\n* Wirtschaft (''English: economy'')\n* Wissen (''English: Science'')\n* Feuilleton (''English: features'')\n* Zeitmagazin \n\n=== Appearance and printing ===\n[[File:ZEIT - Nr1-12-1946.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 1 to 12 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; closed gate]]\n[[File:Czeschka -ZEIT-Hbg-Wappen.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 13 to 18 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; open gate]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - bis Nr. 18 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead edition 13 to 18 (1946)]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - ab Nr. 19 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead since edition 19 (1946)]]\n\nThe masthead lettering in the weekly ''Die Zeit'' with its elegant font was designed by [[Carl Otto Czeschka]] in 1946. Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' which shows the [[Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom|British national coat of arms]] in between ''The'' and ''Times''. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder's self-conception which he published in an editorial called \"''Unsere Aufgabe''{{-\"}} (English: \"Our Mission\") on February 21, 1946.\n\nThe very first version of Czeschka's design, which included the [[Hamburg]] crest, was used from the first edition (published on February 21, 1946) to the 12th edition (published on May 9, 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock's feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions' legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great [[Coat_of_arms_of_Hamburg| Hamburg coat of arms]] by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a [[national emblem]] for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, ''Zeit Magazin'' changed its masthead on June 27, 1946, into the [[Coat_of_arms_of_Bremen| Coat of arms of Bremen]]: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], the mayor of [[Bremen]]. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef M\u00fcller-Marein who later became the editorial director of the ''Zeit''. The design with the ''Bremer Schl\u00fcssel'' in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist [[Alfred Mahlau]] had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of the ''Zeit'' and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in ''Tiemann-Antiqua''. The running texts are printed in ''[[Garamond]]'', a font that is very frequently used in books.\n\nThe ''Zeit'' did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional [[German orthography]], which was led by [[Der Spiegel]], S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and [[Bild]]. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, the ''Zeit'' refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the [[Duden]]. The [[Newspaper_format#Sizes_and_aspect_ratios|nordisch format]], a trademark of the newspaper, has always been addressed in literature and cabaret\u2014mostly in satirical form. According to Hanns Dieter H\u00fcsche the ''Zeit'' is \"''so gro\u00df, wenn man die aufschl\u00e4gt, muss der Nachbar gleich zum Zahnarzt''{{-\"}} (English literally: \"so big, if you open it, the neighbour must go to the dentist immediately\"). In reality however, the format is not bigger than that of a dozen other [[List_of_newspapers_in_Germany|German newspapers]]. The ''Zeit'' is printed by the [[Printer_(publishing)|printers]] Frankfurter Societ\u00e4ts-Druckerei GmbH in M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf and [[Axel Springer SE]] in [[Ahrensburg]]. The [[Deutscher Pressevertrieb]], based in Hamburg, is in charge of the distribution of the newspapers.\n\n=== Zeitmagazin ===\nThe ''Zeitmagazin'' was first published as a supplement in 1970 and later discontinued in 1999. The ''Zeit'' then introduced the section ''Leben'' (''English: Lifestyle''). Since May 24 2007, the ''Zeit'' reintroduced the ''Zeitmagazin''.\nFor the supplement's 40th birthday, the ''Zeit'' published a 100-page anniversary issue, including 40 different covers - one for each year.\n\n=== Circulation ===\nThe 1993 circulation of ''Die Zeit'' was 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Humphreys|title=Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=82|url=https://www.google.com.tr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2vlTzbOGhdIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=media+and+magazines+in+central+europe&ots=rDZApnAeFb&sig=3smUcJ-cI-LHdK1BuERlh1TnG4I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> With a circulation of 504,072 for the second half of 2012<ref name=zeitm>{{cite web|title=The Die Zeit Universe|url=http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|work=ZEITmagazin|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=1 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144920/http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and an estimated readership of slightly above 2 million, it is the most widely read German weekly newspaper.

The independent editorial office consists of around 70 editors, graphic designers and technicians. Upon February 1, 2009, ''Zeit Online'', ''Tagesspiegel Online'' and ''zoomer.de'' were merged into ''Zeit Digital'' with one joint editorial office in [[Berlin]]. Only some editors as well as the technology and the marketing departments remained in [[Hamburg]]. ''Zoomer.de'' was discontinued in February 2009, and the editorial office of ''Tagesspiegel Online'' was handed back to ''Tagesspiegel'' in September 2009. In 2017, ''Die Zeit'' was among the most quoted sources in German Wikipedia. At present, it is one of the 100 most visited websites in Germany.\n\n'''Sections: '''\n\nThe content is categorized into four section groups that each consist of one or more sections, as follows: \n\n-\tPolitics, Economy and Society\n\n-\tCulture and Discovery\n\n-\tKnowledge & Digital \n\n-\tSports \n\nSince April 2014, Zeit Online also has been publishing a local section for Hamburg.\n\nIn a survey of German literature blogs, the literature section of Zeit Online was rated as the best portal, better than the literature section of Spiegel, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine amongst others. \n\nOn November, 2nd 2012, Zeit online launched a Content API that developers can use.\n\n'''Website traffic:''' \n\nUp to 2017, the Zeit experienced a significant increase in clicks on their website. In March 2017, Z+ was launched and so was a payment model for the new product. Since then, some of the content has only been available after payment. \n\nIn January 2019, the website was visited 75,1 million times. On average, 2,34 pages were opened per visit. \n\n'''Recent History:''' \n\nGero von Randow, a former Zeit editor, was the editor-in-chief until February 2008. The journalist Wolfgang Blau took over his position in March of that year. Blau joined The Guardian in April 2013. Since March 15th, 2013, Jochen Wegner has been in charge.

It is known for its very large physical paper format ([[aspect ratio (newspaper)|Nordisch]]) and its long and detailed articles.\n\n== Print edition ==\n\n=== Sections and supplements ===\nThe ''Zeit'' is divided into different sections. Some of which are:\n* Politik (''English: politics'')\n* Streit (''English literally: fight'')\n* Dossier (''English: dossier)\n* Geschichte (''English: history'')\n* Wirtschaft (''English: economy'')\n* Wissen (''English: Science'')\n* Feuilleton (''English: features'')\n* Zeitmagazin \n\n=== Appearance and printing ===\n[[File:ZEIT - Nr1-12-1946.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 1 to 12 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; closed gate]]\n[[File:Czeschka -ZEIT-Hbg-Wappen.jpg|thumb|Hamburg crest used in edition 13 to 18 (1946) by C.O. Czeschka; open gate]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - bis Nr. 18 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead edition 13 to 18 (1946)]]\n[[File:ZEIT-Kopfzeile - ab Nr. 19 1946.jpg|thumb|Zeit masthead since edition 19 (1946)]]\n\nThe masthead lettering in the weekly ''Die Zeit'' with its elegant font was designed by [[Carl Otto Czeschka]] in 1946. Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' which shows the [[Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom|British national coat of arms]] in between ''The'' and ''Times''. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder's self-conception which he published in an editorial called \"''Unsere Aufgabe''{{-\"}} (English: \"Our Mission\") on February 21, 1946.\n\nThe very first version of Czeschka's design, which included the [[Hamburg]] crest, was used from the first edition (published on February 21, 1946) to the 12th edition (published on May 9, 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock's feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions' legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great [[Coat_of_arms_of_Hamburg| Hamburg coat of arms]] by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a [[national emblem]] for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, ''Zeit Magazin'' changed its masthead on June 27, 1946, into the [[Coat_of_arms_of_Bremen| Coat of arms of Bremen]]: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by [[Wilhelm Kaisen]], the mayor of [[Bremen]]. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef M\u00fcller-Marein who later became the editorial director of the ''Zeit''. The design with the ''Bremer Schl\u00fcssel'' in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist [[Alfred Mahlau]] had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of the ''Zeit'' and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in ''Tiemann-Antiqua''. The running texts are printed in ''[[Garamond]]'', a font that is very frequently used in books.\n\nThe ''Zeit'' did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional [[German orthography]], which was led by [[Der Spiegel]], S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and [[Bild]]. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, the ''Zeit'' refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the [[Duden]]. The [[Newspaper_format#Sizes_and_aspect_ratios|nordisch format]], a trademark of the newspaper, has always been addressed in literature and cabaret\u2014mostly in satirical form. According to Hanns Dieter H\u00fcsche the ''Zeit'' is \"''so gro\u00df, wenn man die aufschl\u00e4gt, muss der Nachbar gleich zum Zahnarzt''{{-\"}} (English literally: \"so big, if you open it, the neighbour must go to the dentist immediately\"). In reality however, the format is not bigger than that of a dozen other [[List_of_newspapers_in_Germany|German newspapers]]. The ''Zeit'' is printed by the [[Printer_(publishing)|printers]] Frankfurter Societ\u00e4ts-Druckerei GmbH in M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf and [[Axel Springer SE]] in [[Ahrensburg]]. The [[Deutscher Pressevertrieb]], based in Hamburg, is in charge of the distribution of the newspapers.\n\n=== Zeitmagazin ===\nThe ''Zeitmagazin'' was first published as a supplement in 1970 and later discontinued in 1999. The ''Zeit'' then introduced the section ''Leben'' (''English: Lifestyle''). Since May 24 2007, the ''Zeit'' reintroduced the ''Zeitmagazin''.\nFor the supplement's 40th birthday, the ''Zeit'' published a 100-page anniversary issue, including 40 different covers - one for each year.\n\n=== Circulation ===\nThe 1993 circulation of ''Die Zeit'' was 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Humphreys|title=Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=82|url=https://www.google.com.tr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2vlTzbOGhdIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=media+and+magazines+in+central+europe&ots=rDZApnAeFb&sig=3smUcJ-cI-LHdK1BuERlh1TnG4I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> With a circulation of 504,072 for the second half of 2012<ref name=zeitm>{{cite web|title=The Die Zeit Universe|url=http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|work=ZEITmagazin|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=1 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144920/http://www.iqm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Sonstige/International/Downloads/Zeitmagazin_PL_E_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and an estimated readership of slightly above 2 million, it is the most widely read German weekly newspaper.

Its capital and largest city is [[Heraklion]], located on the northern shore of the island. {{As of|2011}}, the region had a population of 623,065. The [[Dodecanese]] are located to the northeast of Crete, while the [[Cyclades]] are situated to the north, separated by the [[Sea of Crete]]. The [[Peloponnese]] is to the region's northwest.\n\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age. Crete was the centre of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], from 2700 to 1420 BC; the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. Later, Crete fell under Roman rule, and afterwards the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Andalusia]]n [[Arabs]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] successively ruled Crete. The Cretan people, who maintained a desire to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans in 1898 as the [[Cretan State]] and became part of Greece in December 1913.\n\nThe island is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east; the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) contains Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]). The [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] airport at [[Heraklion]] and the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] serve international travelers.

Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|links=no}}); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] ({{lang-el|links=no|\u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}}); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.\n\n===Mountains and valleys===\n<!--Linked from [[:Category:Mountains of Crete]]-->\n\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:\n*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2454|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] {{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}} {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Thripti {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\nThese mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Gourgouthakas]], [[Diktaion]], and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.\n\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23\u201358 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810}}</ref>\n\n===Gorges, rivers and lakes===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos.

As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\n\nThe south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]].

From west to east these are: [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]], and [[Lasithi]].

[[Chania]] was the capital until 1971.

However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\n\nAs in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[Greek citron|citrons]] and [[Avocado|avocadoes]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.4 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,800 \u20ac or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fith highest GDP per capita.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\n[[File:Kreta - Europastra\u00dfe75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]\n\n====Airports====\nThe island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n====Ferries====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].\n\n====Road Network====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\n====Railway====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port.  There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.<ref name=\"books.google.gr\">Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\n\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\n\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}\nCrete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title \"''Creticus''\". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}</ref> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the [[Panhellenion]], a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor [[Hadrian]]. When [[Diocletian]] redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the [[diocese of Moesia]], and later by [[Constantine I]] to the [[diocese of Macedonia]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}\n\n[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century.

Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\n\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.\n\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\".<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\n\nThe [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u201369)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]] or Great Cretan Revolution ({{lang-el|links=no|\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866}}) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n===Cretan State 1898\u20131908===\n{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt|Candia massacre}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]]]]\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165.

As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<ref name=Holland>Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850\u20131960''. p. 81.

According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Gortys R02.jpg|View of [[Gortyn]]\nFile:Festos1(js).jpg|Archaeological site of [[Phaistos]]\nFile:Knossos south propylaeum.jpg|Ruins of the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]]\nFile:Archaeological Museum of Chania.jpg|Archeological Museum of [[Chania]]\nFile:AMC Intern of Museum of Chania (Crete) 2.jpg|[[Chania|Museum of Chania]]\nFile:Chania naval museum.jpg|Chania Naval museum\nFile:Pluto Serapis and Persephone Isis Heraklion museum.jpg|[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and [[Persephone]] in [[Heraklion]] Museum\nFile:Jars in Malia Crete the two.jpg|Jars in [[Malia, Crete|Malia]], Crete\n</gallery>\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n===Fauna===\n\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all \"harmful\" and \"poisonous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[natural history museum]], the [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums \u2013 [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n====Prehistoric fauna====\n[[Dwarf elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|dwarf hippopotamus]], [[dwarf mammoths]], [[Candiacervus|dwarf deer]], and [[Cretan owl|giant flightless owls]] were native to [[Pleistocene]] Crete.<ref>Van der Geer, A.A.E., Dermitzakis, M., De Vos, J., 2006.

One such area is located at the island of [[Elafonisi]] on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in eastern Crete and the [[Dionysades]] (both in the municipality of [[Sitia]], [[Lasithi]]), have diverse animal and plant life. [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Ierapetra]], has the largest naturally-grown ''[[Juniperus macrocarpa]]'' forest in Europe.

The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M. Galt, \"A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera\", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).</ref> [[Heracles]], in one of his labors, took the [[Cretan bull]] to the Peloponnese. [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and [[Zeus]] made love at [[Gortys]] and conceived the kings of Crete: [[Rhadamanthys]], [[Sarpedon (brother of Minos)|Sarpedon]], and [[Minos]].\n\nThe [[labyrinth]] of the [[Palace of Knossos]] was the setting for the myth of [[Theseus#Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]] in which the [[Minotaur]] was slain by [[Theseus]]. [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape. After his death [[King Minos]] became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]], while [[Rhadamanthys]] became the ruler of the Elysian fields.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Greece}}\n{{See also|Cretan School|Cretan literature|Music of Crete|Cretan cuisine}}\n\nCrete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nCretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.\nCrete is also famous for its traditional cuisine.

Its capital and largest city is [[Heraklion]], located on the northern shore of the island. {{As of|2011}}, the region had a population of 623,065. The [[Dodecanese]] are located to the northeast of Crete, while the [[Cyclades]] are situated to the north, separated by the [[Sea of Crete]]. The [[Peloponnese]] is to the region's northwest.\n\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age. Crete was the centre of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], from 2700 to 1420 BC; the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. Later, Crete fell under Roman rule, and afterwards the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Andalusia]]n [[Arabs]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] successively ruled Crete. The Cretan people, who maintained a desire to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans in 1898 as the [[Cretan State]] and became part of Greece in December 1913.\n\nThe island is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east; the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) contains Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]).

The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23\u201358 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810}}</ref>\n\n===Gorges, rivers and lakes===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos.

Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[biologist]]s. Some are [[Environmental protection|environmentally protected]]. A small sample of the islands includes:\n*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\n*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\n*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe\n*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\n*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)\n*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi\n\nOff the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Greece}}\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\n\nThe south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.<ref>Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

From west to east these are: [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]], and [[Lasithi]]. These are further subdivided into 24 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].\n\nThe region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, [[Stavros Arnaoutakis]], who was elected in the [[Greek local elections, 2010|November 2010 local administration elections]] for the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]].\n\n===Cities===\n{{Main|Cities of Greece}}\n\n[[Heraklion]] is the largest city and capital of Crete.

However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\n\nAs in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[Greek citron|citrons]] and [[Avocado|avocadoes]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.4 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,800 \u20ac or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fith highest GDP per capita.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\n[[File:Kreta - Europastra\u00dfe75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]\n\n====Airports====\nThe island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n====Ferries====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].\n\n====Road Network====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\n====Railway====\nAlso, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port.

A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\n\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\n\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}\nCrete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title \"''Creticus''\". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}</ref> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the [[Panhellenion]], a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor [[Hadrian]]. When [[Diocletian]] redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the [[diocese of Moesia]], and later by [[Constantine I]] to the [[diocese of Macedonia]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}\n\n[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century.

The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]]. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]' [[Siege of Chandax|campaign]] completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.\n\n===Byzantine Empire \u2013 second period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}\n\nIn 961, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs.<ref name=intro>Panagiotakis, Introduction, p.

Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader [[Boniface of Montferrat]]<ref name=intro/> in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the [[Republic of Venice]],<ref name=intro/> whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade.

Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\n\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.\n\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\".<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.\n\nThe [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u201369)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]] or Great Cretan Revolution ({{lang-el|links=no|\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1866}}) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n===Cretan State 1898\u20131908===\n{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt|Candia massacre}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]]]]\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165.

As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<ref name=Holland>Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850\u20131960''. p. 81.

During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources.

As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all \"harmful\" and \"poisonous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[natural history museum]], the [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums \u2013 [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n====Prehistoric fauna====\n[[Dwarf elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|dwarf hippopotamus]], [[dwarf mammoths]], [[Candiacervus|dwarf deer]], and [[Cretan owl|giant flightless owls]] were native to [[Pleistocene]] Crete.<ref>Van der Geer, A.A.E., Dermitzakis, M., De Vos, J., 2006.

The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M.

The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nCretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]].

Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany.

It developed into the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (1896; \"RIETS\") and eventually [[Yeshiva University]] in 1945. It was established in the wake of [[History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States#Immigration_of_Central_and_Eastern_European_Jews|the immigration of Central and Eastern European Jews]] (1880's - 1924). \n[[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem]], founded in 1907, was led by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] from the 1940s;\n[[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], est 1904, was headed by Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]] from 1943 to 1980.\n[[:Category:Hasidic Judaism in the United States|Many Hasidic dynasties]] have their main Yeshivot in America, typically established in the 1940s; [[770_Eastern_Parkway#Central_Lubavitcher_Yeshiva| the Central Lubavitcher Yeshiva]] now has over 1000 students.\n\nThe postwar establishment of Ashkenazi yeshivot parallels that in Israel; \nas does the educational pattern in [[Haredi_Judaism#United_States|the American Haredi community]], although more obtain a secular education at the college level;\nsee [[#College credit]] above.\n[[Beth Medrash Govoha]] in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]  with 3,000 students in the early 2000s was founded in 1943 by R.

On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.\n|}\n[[File:Yeshiva lunchroom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Mincha]]'',  [[Yeshiva Centre, Melbourne]] ]]\nYeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, as regards several structural features - curriculum aside.\nThe year is structured into \"''zmanim''\"; the day is structured into \"''seders''\".\nThe learning itself is delivered through a \"''shiur''\", a lecture with pre-specified sources; \nstudy in general, and particularly the preparation for ''shiur'', takes place in \"''chavruta''\" or paired-study.\nThis study is in a common venue called the ''[[beth midrash|bet midrash]]''.\n\nThe institution is headed by its ''[[Rosh Yeshiva]]'', while other senior Rabbis are referred to as \"Ram\" (''[[Rosh mesivta|Rosh Mesivta]], Reish Metivta''); \nthe [[Mashgiach ruchani|''Mashgiach'']] assumes responsibility for students' spiritual development (''[[Mashpia]]'', in Hasidic Yeshivot).\nA Kollel is headed by its ''[[Rosh Kollel]]'', even when it is part of a Yeshiva.\nA ''sho'el umeishiv'' (lit. \"ask and he answers\") is usually available to consult to students on difficult points in their day's Talmudic studies.\nThe Rabbi responsible for the (Talmud) ''shiur'' is known as a ''[[Maggid Shiur]]''. Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], and (less often) [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College.

After (and during) the war, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors.\nThe Mir in Jerusalem - today the largest Yeshiva in the world - was established in 1944, by Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students.\nPorat Yosef, the leading Sephardi Yeshiva, was founded in 1914; its  predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904.\nFrom the 1940s and onward, especially following  immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities,  Sephardi leaders, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and [[Mizrahi Jews]] (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).\n\nThe Haredi community has grown with time - In 2016, 9% of Israel's population was Haredi, including [[Sephardic Haredim]] -  supporting a large number of yeshivot correspondingly (see [[Israel #Religion]]). \nBoys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see ''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'' and ''[[Bais Yaakov]]''.\nA significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; after marriage, many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2006, there were 80,000 in full-time learning .<ref name =\"JVL\"/>)\nKollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard \"undergraduate\" program ; see [[#Talmud study]] below.\nSome Kollels similarly focus on Halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) or  [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|''Dayanut'']] (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.\n\n[[Mercaz Harav]], the foundational and leading [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a [[Hesder]] yeshiva (discussed [[#Types of yeshivot|below]]) during [[Religious_Zionism#Military_service|their national service]]; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].)\nWomen correspondingly study in a [[Midrasha]]. \nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''.\n[[Bar Ilan University]] allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly, which also offers a Haredi track;\nthere are [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'' (these often offer a specialization in ''Tanakh'' or ''Machshavah'' - see [[Yeshiva#Curriculum|below]]).\nTraining as a ''Dayan'' in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\nSee [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]].\n\n=====United States=====\n:''See: [[:Category:Orthodox yeshivas in the United States]].''\nThe first Orthodox yeshiva in the United States was [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Manhattan)|Etz Chaim]] of [[New York City|New York]] (1886), modeled after Volozhin. It developed into the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (1896; \"RIETS\") and eventually [[Yeshiva University]] in 1945. It was established in the wake of [[History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States#Immigration_of_Central_and_Eastern_European_Jews|the immigration of Central and Eastern European Jews]] (1880's - 1924). \n[[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem]], founded in 1907, was led by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] from the 1940s;\n[[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], est 1904, was headed by Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]] from 1943 to 1980.\n[[:Category:Hasidic Judaism in the United States|Many Hasidic dynasties]] have their main Yeshivot in America, typically established in the 1940s; [[770_Eastern_Parkway#Central_Lubavitcher_Yeshiva| the Central Lubavitcher Yeshiva]] now has over 1000 students.\n\nThe postwar establishment of Ashkenazi yeshivot parallels that in Israel; \nas does the educational pattern in [[Haredi_Judaism#United_States|the American Haredi community]], although more obtain a secular education at the college level;\nsee [[#College credit]] above.\n[[Beth Medrash Govoha]] in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]  with 3,000 students in the early 2000s was founded in 1943 by R.

On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.\n|}\n[[File:Yeshiva lunchroom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Mincha]]'',  [[Yeshiva Centre, Melbourne]] ]]\nYeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, as regards several structural features - curriculum aside.\nThe year is structured into \"''zmanim''\"; the day is structured into \"''seders''\".\nThe learning itself is delivered through a \"''shiur''\", a lecture with pre-specified sources; \nstudy in general, and particularly the preparation for ''shiur'', takes place in \"''chavruta''\" or paired-study.\nThis study is in a common venue called the ''[[beth midrash|bet midrash]]''.\n\nThe institution is headed by its ''[[Rosh Yeshiva]]'', while other senior Rabbis are referred to as \"Ram\" (''[[Rosh mesivta|Rosh Mesivta]], Reish Metivta''); \nthe [[Mashgiach ruchani|''Mashgiach'']] assumes responsibility for students' spiritual development (''[[Mashpia]]'', in Hasidic Yeshivot).\nA Kollel is headed by its ''[[Rosh Kollel]]'', even when it is part of a Yeshiva.\nA ''sho'el umeishiv'' (lit. \"ask and he answers\") is usually available to consult to students on difficult points in their day's Talmudic studies.\nThe Rabbi responsible for the (Talmud) ''shiur'' is known as a ''[[Maggid Shiur]]''. Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), [[Niddah]], and (less often) [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJewish law", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}

One way science journalism can achieve that is to avoid an [[information deficit model]] of communication, which assumes a top-down, one-way direction of communicating information that limits an open dialogue between knowledge holders and the public.\n\nScience journalists often have training in the scientific disciplines that they cover. Some have earned a degree in a scientific field before becoming journalists or exhibited talent in writing about science subjects. However, good preparation for interviews and even deceptively simple questions such as \"What does this mean to the people on the street?\" can often help a science journalist develop material that is useful for the intended audience. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Status==\nWith budget cuts at major newspapers and other media, there are fewer working science journalists working for traditional print and broadcast media than before.<ref name=\"ibtimes1\">{{cite web|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Remember Newspaper Science Sections?

One way science journalism can achieve that is to avoid an [[information deficit model]] of communication, which assumes a top-down, one-way direction of communicating information that limits an open dialogue between knowledge holders and the public.\n\nScience journalists often have training in the scientific disciplines that they cover. Some have earned a degree in a scientific field before becoming journalists or exhibited talent in writing about science subjects. However, good preparation for interviews and even deceptively simple questions such as \"What does this mean to the people on the street?\" can often help a science journalist develop material that is useful for the intended audience. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Status==\nWith budget cuts at major newspapers and other media, there are fewer working science journalists working for traditional print and broadcast media than before.<ref name=\"ibtimes1\">{{cite web|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Remember Newspaper Science Sections?

{"title_page": "Lean construction", "text_new": "'''Lean construction''' is a combination of [[operational research]] and practical development in design and construction with an adaption of [[lean manufacturing]] principles and practices to the end-to-end design and construction process.  Unlike manufacturing, construction is a project-based production process. Lean Construction is concerned with the alignment and holistic pursuit of concurrent and continuous improvements in all dimensions of the built and natural environment: design, construction, activation, maintenance, salvaging, and recycling (Abdelhamid 2007, Abdelhamid et al. 2008).  This approach tries to manage and improve construction processes with minimum cost and maximum value by considering customer needs (Koskela et al. 2002<ref name = koskela-et-al-2002 />), while it helps to achieve and maintain sustainability objectives in all three dimension of planet, people and profit across the entire construction supply chain (Solaimani & Sedighi, 2019<ref>Solaimani, S., & Sedighi, M.

Analysis of project plan failures indicated that \"normally only about 50% of the tasks on weekly work plans are completed by the end of the plan week\" and that constructors could mitigate most of the problems through \"active management of variability, starting with the structuring of the project (temporary production system) and continuing through its operation and improvement,\" (Ballard and Howell 2003<ref name = ballard-and-howell-2003>{{cite conference | last1= Ballard| first1= Glenn | last2= Howell | first2= Gregory | title= Competing Construction Management Paradigms| booktitle = Proceedings of the 2003 ASCE Construction Research Congress | date = 19\u201321 March 2003 | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/LCJ_04_0008.pdf | format = pdf | pages = | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}</ref>).\n\nEvidence from research and observations indicated that the conceptual models of Construction Management and the tools it utilizes ([[work breakdown structure]], [[critical path method]], and [[earned value management]]) fail to deliver projects 'on-time, at budget, and at desired quality' (Abdelhamid 2004).  With recurring negative experiences on projects, evidenced by endemic quality problems and rising litigation, it became evident that the governing principles of construction management needed revisiting. One comment published by the [[Construction Management Association of America|CMAA]], in its ''Sixth Annual Survey of Owners'' (2006), pointed to concern about work methods and the cost of waste: <blockquote>\"While the cost of steel and cement are making headlines, the less publicized failures in the management of construction projects can be disastrous. Listen carefully to the message in this comment. We are not talking about just materials, methods, equipment, or contract documents. We are talking about how we work to deliver successful capital projects and how we manage the costs of inefficiency.\"<ref name = sixth-annual-survey>{{cite web | year = 2006 | title = Sixth Annual Survey of Owners | url = http://www.cmaafoundation.org/files/surveys/2005-survey.pdf | author = FMI/CMAA | publisher = Construction Management Association of America | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===A new paradigm===\nKoskela (2000)<ref name = koskela-thesis/> argued that the mismatch between the conceptual models and observed reality underscored the lack of robustness in the existing constructs and signaled the need for a theory of production in construction. Koskela then used the ideal production system embodied in the [[Toyota Production System]] to develop a more overarching production [[management paradigm]] for project-based production systems where production is conceptualized in three complementary ways, namely, as a Transformation (T), as a Flow (F), and as Value generation (V).\n: '''Transformation''' is the production of inputs into outputs.<ref name = koskela-thesis/>\n\n: '''Flow''' can be defined as \"Movement that is smooth and uninterrupted, as in the 'flow of work from one crew to the next' or the flow of value at the Pull of the customer.\"<ref name = lci-glossary/>\n\n: '''Value''' is \"What the Customer is actually paying for the project to produce and install.\"<ref name = lci-glossary>{{Cite web |url=http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |title=LCI Glossary |access-date=2009-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227061851/http://leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |archive-date=2009-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nKoskela and Howell (2002) also presented a review of existing management theory \u2013 specifically as related to the planning, execution, and control paradigms \u2013 in project-based production systems. Both conceptualizations provide a solid intellectual foundation of lean construction as evident from both research and practice (Abdelhamid 2004).\n\nRecognizing that construction sites reflect prototypical behavior of complex and chaotic systems, especially in the flow of both material and information on and off site, Bertelsen (2003a and 2003b) suggested that construction should be modeled using chaos and complex systems theory.\nBertelsen (2003b) specifically argued that construction could and should be understood in three complementary ways:\n* As a project-based production process\n* As an industry that provides autonomous agents\n* As a social system\n\n==What is Lean Construction?==\nThe term ''lean construction'' was coined by the [[International Group for Lean Construction]] in its first meeting in 1993 (Gleeson et al. 2007).  Greg Howell and Glenn Ballard (founders of the Lean Construction Institute in 1997) both maintain that ''Construction'' in ''Lean Construction'' refers to the entire industry and not the phase during which construction takes place.  Thus, Lean Construction is for owners, architects, designers, engineers, constructors, suppliers & end users.\n\nIn any case, the term Lean Construction has escaped canonical definition.  There has been a number of reasons for that.  The body of knowledge is in a state of development since 1990.  Nonetheless, a definition is needed to be able to operationalize the concepts and principles contained in the philosophy.  It is insightful to study the change of definition over time as that represents the evolution and advancement in the state of knowledge about Lean Construction.  \n\nThe reference to Lean Construction as a proper noun is not an attempt to falsely distinguish it from other areas that focus on construction project management. It is a proper noun because it refers to a very specific set of concepts, principles, and practices that are distinct from conventional design and construction management practices .\n\nA number of groups have proposed definitions: The International Group for Lean Construction; The Lean Construction Institute; The Associated General Contractors of America; Construction Management Association of America, and others.  Researchers have also put forward definitions as foundation for their work and to invite others to add, modify and critique. A sampling is provided here.\n\nLean Construction is a \u201cway to design production systems to minimize waste of materials, time, and effort in order to generate the maximum possible amount of value,\" (Koskela et al. 2002<ref name = koskela-et-al-2002>{{cite book | last1 =Koskela | first1 =L.\n | last2 =Howell | first2 = G.\n | last3 =Ballard | first3 =G.\n | last4 =Tommelein | first4 =I. | author-link = | author2-link = | chapter = Foundations of Lean Construction | title = Design and Construction: Building in Value | editor1-last = Best | editor1-first = Rick | editor2-last = de Valence | editor2-first = Gerard | place = Oxford, UK | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann, Elsevier | year = 2002 | month= | edition = | chapterurl = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0750651490}}</ref>).  Designing a production system to achieve the stated ends is only possible through the collaboration of all project participants (Owner, A/E, contractors, Facility Managers, End-user) at early stages of the project.  This goes beyond the contractual arrangement of design/build or constructability reviews where contractors, and sometime facility managers, merely react to designs instead of informing and influencing the design (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).\n\nLean Construction recognizes that desired ends affect the means to achieve these ends, and that available means will affect realized ends (Lichtig 2004).  Essentially, Lean Construction aims to embody the benefits of the Master Builder concept (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).\n\n\"One can think of lean construction in a way similar to [[mesoeconomics]]. Lean construction draws upon the principles of project-level management and upon the principles that govern production-level management. Lean construction recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.\" (Abdelhamid 2007)\n\nLean construction supplements traditional construction management approaches with (Abdelhamid 2007): (1) two critical and necessary dimensions for successful capital project delivery by requiring the deliberate consideration of material and information flow and value generation in a production system; and (2) different project and production management (planning-execution-control) paradigms.\n\nWhile lean construction is identical to lean production in spirit, it is different in how it was conceived as well as how it is practiced. There is a view that \"adaptation\" of Lean Manufacturing/Production forms the basis of Lean Construction.  The view of Lauri Koskela, Greg Howell, and Glenn Ballard is very different, with the origin of lean construction arising mainly from the need for a production theory in construction and anomalies that were observed in the reliability of weekly [[production planning]].\n\nGetting work to flow reliably and predictably on a construction site requires the impeccable alignment of the entire supply chain responsible for constructed facilities such that value is maximized and waste is minimized.  With such a broad scope, it is fair to say that tools found in Lean Manufacturing and Lean Production, as practiced by Toyota and others, have been adapted to be used in the fulfillment of Lean construction principles. TQM, [[Statistical process control|SPC]], six-sigma, have all found their way into lean construction. Similarly, tools and methods found in other areas, such as in social science and business, are used where they are applicable. The tools and methods in construction management, such as CPM and work breakdown structure, etc., are also utilized in lean construction implementations. The three unique tools and methods that were specifically conceived for lean construction are the Last Planner System, Target Value Design, and the Lean Project Delivery System.\n\nIf the tool, method, and/or technique will assist in fulfilling the aims of lean construction, it is considered a part of the toolkit available for use.  A sampling of these tools includes: [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Lean Design), A3, process design (Lean Design), offsite fabrication and [[Just in time (business)|JIT]] (Lean Supply), [[Value stream mapping|value chain mapping]] (Lean Assembly), visual site (Lean Assembly); [[5S (methodology)|5S]] (Lean Assembly), daily crew [[Stand-up meeting|huddles]] (Lean Assembly).\n\nThe priority for all construction work is to:\n# Keep work flowing so that the crews are always productive installing product\n# Reduce inventory of material and tools and\n# Reduce costs<ref name = sowards-2004>{{cite journal | url = http://contractormag.com/technology/cm_newsarticle_456 | last= Sowards | first= Dennis | title= 5S's that would make any CEO Happy | journal= Contractor Magazine |date=June 2004 | accessdate= 31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile lean construction\u2019s main tool for making design and construction processes more predictable is the '''Last Planner System''' ([[#Last_Planner_System|see below]]) and derivatives of it, other lean tools already proven in manufacturing have been adapted to the construction industry with equal success.

The IPD approach to contracting aligns project objectives with the interests of key participants. IPD relies on participant selection, transparency and continuing dialog. Construction consumers might consider rethinking their contracting strategies to share more fully in the benefits. The IPD approach creates an organization with the ability to apply [[Lean Project Delivery]] (LPD) principles and practices.

This distinction is needed because Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is now{{when | date = March 2013}} only referring to the multi-party agreement regardless of what practices are used, the so-called IPD-lite or IPD-ish.{{citation needed | date = March 2013}}\n\n==Practical applications of lean construction==\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn the UK, a major R&D project, ''Building Down Barriers'', was launched in 1997 to adapt the Toyota Production System for use in the construction sector. The resulting supply chain management toolset was tested and refined on two pilot projects and the comprehensive and detailed process-based toolset was published in 2000 as the 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials'.  The project demonstrated very clearly that lean thinking would only deliver major performance improvements if the construction sector learned from the extensive experience of other business sectors. Lean thinking must become the way that all the firms in the design and construction supply chain co-operate with each other at a strategic level that over-arches individual projects. In the aerospace sector, these long-term supply-side relationships are called a '[[Virtuality|Virtual]] Company', in other business sectors they are called an 'Extended Lean Enterprise'.\n\nThe UK 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials' states that: 'The commercial core of supply chain management is setting up long-term relationships based on improving the value of what the supply chain delivers, improving quality and reducing underlying costs through taking out waste and inefficiency. This is the opposite of 'business as usual' in the construction sector, where people do things on project after project in the same old inefficient ways, forcing each other to give up profits and overhead recovery in order to deliver at what seems the market price. What results is a fight over who keeps any of the meagre margins that result from each project, or attempts to recoup 'negative margins' through 'claims', The last thing that receives time or energy in this desperate, project-by-project gladiatorial battle for survival is consideration of how to reduce underlying costs or improve quality'.\n\n==Last Planner System==\nThe Last Planner System, as developed by the Lean Construction Institute,{{citation needed |date = April 2013}} is: <blockquote>The collaborative, commitment-based planning system that integrates should-can-will-did planning (pull planning, make-ready, look-ahead planning) with constraint analysis, weekly work planning based upon reliable promises, and learning based upon analysis of PPC (plan percent complete) and reasons for variance.<ref>[http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm ''Glossary''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227061851/http://leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |date=2009-02-27 }} Lean Construction Institute</ref></blockquote>\n\nUsers such as owners, clients or construction companies, can use LPS to achieve better performance in design and construction through increased '''schedule/programme predictability''' (i.e. work is completed as and when promised).{{citation needed |date = April 2013}}\n\nLPS is a system of inter-related elements, and full benefits come when all are implemented together. It is based on simple paper forms, so it can be administered using [[Post-it note]]s, paper, pencil, eraser and photocopier. A spreadsheet can help.\n\nLPS begins with '''collaborative scheduling/programming''' engaging the main project suppliers from the start. Risk analysis ensures that float is built in where it will best protect programme integrity and predictability.  Where appropriate the process can be used for ''programme compression'' too. In this way, one constructor took 6 weeks out of an 18-week programme for the construction of a 40 bed hotel.  Benefits to the client are enormous.\n\n[[Image:Intense discussion during a programme compression workshop.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 1: intense discussion during a programme compression workshop'''\n\nBefore work starts, team leaders '''make tasks ready''' so that when work should be done, it can be.  Why put work into production if a pre-requisite is missing?  This ''MakeReady'' process continues throughout the project.\n\n[[Image:Part of MakeReady form.jpg]] <br />\n'''Figure 2: part of a MakeReady form for documenting the process of making tasks ready (this one for use in design)'''\n\nThere is a '''weekly work planning''' (WWP) meeting involving all the last planners \u2013 design team leaders and/or trade supervisors on site.  It is in everyone\u2019s interest to explore inter-dependencies between tasks and prevent colleagues from over-committing.\n\n[[Image:Part of a Weekly Work Plan form.png]]<br />\n'''Figure 3: part of a Weekly Work Plan form used by trade foremen on site or design team leaders to prepare for the WWP meeting'''.\n\nThis weekly work planning processes is built around ''promises''.  The agreed programme defines when tasks ''should'' be done and acts as a request to the supplier to do that task.  The ''last planners'' (that is the trade foremen on site or design team leaders in a design process) only promise once they have clarified the conditions of satisfaction and are clear that the task '''can''' be done.\n\n[[Image:The promise cycle.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 4: the promise cycle (after [[Fernando Flores]])'''\n\nOnce the task is complete the last planner responsible declares completion so that site management or the next trade can assure themselves that it is complete to an appropriate standard.\n\nA key measure of the success of the Last Planner system is '''PPC'''.  This measures the ''Percentage of Promises Completed'' on time.  As PPC increases. project productivity and profitability increase, with step changes at around 70% and 85%.  This score is measured site-wide and displayed around the site.  Weekly measures are used by the project and by individual suppliers as the basis for learning how to improve the predictability of the work programme and hence the PPC scores.\n\nA key part of the '''continual improvement''' process is a study of the reasons why tasks promised in the WWP are delivered late.  The following chart shows typical reasons:\n\n[[Image:Example of a reasons Pareto chart.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 5: example of a reasons Pareto chart'''\n\nRecording the reasons in a [[Pareto chart]] like the one above makes it easy to see where attention is most likely to yield the most results.  Using tools like 5 Why analysis and cause-effect diagrams will help the team understand how they can improve the clarity of information and ensure that there are sufficient operatives.\n\nLast Planner benefits don\u2019t stop at project predictability, profit and productivity; it contributes to positive changes in other industry KPIs. Danish research {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} shows almost half the accidents and up to 70% less sickness absence on LPS managed sites.\n\nLCI retains a registered Trademark on the term and Copyright in the idea and materials to prevent people who misunderstand or misrepresent the system from using it in trade. Consulting companies or individuals wishing to use the Last Planner System in trade (commercial offering of service) must first be approved by LCI. Consultants are expected to make financial and other contributions to LCI in recognition of the work and effort LCI put into developing Last Planner.\n\nLast Planner System development continues under the direction of Lean Construction Institute Directors [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822194259/http://www.leanconstruction.org/ballardbio.htm Professor Glenn Ballard] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20010909115359/http://leanconstruction.org/howellbio.htm Greg Howell] with support from users around the world. For more information about the development process see Ballard (1994,<ref name = ballard-1994/> 2000) and Ballard and Howell (2004) for example.\n\nFor a detailed description and list of the benefits of LPS, see ''Mossman: Last Planner\u00ae: 5 + 1 crucial & collaborative conversations for predictable design & construction delivery''<ref>[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3369275/Mossman-Last-Planner.pdf Mossman-Last-Planner.pdf]</ref> and for additional references see the Designing Buildings wiki.<ref>http://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/The_Last_Planner_System</ref>\n\n==Differences between LC and project management approaches==\nThere are many differences between the Lean Construction (LC) approach and the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) approach to construction. These include:\n\n*Managing the interaction between activities and combined effects of dependence and variation, is a first concern in lean construction because their interactions highly affects the time and cost of projects (Howell, 1999<ref name = howell-1999>{{cite conference | last= Howell | first= Gregory A. | year = 1999 | title = What is Lean Construction | publisher = Lean Construction Institute | url= http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/Howell.pdf | booktitle = Proceedings IGLC-7 | pages= 1\u201310 | format= pdf | accessdate= 31 March 2013}}</ref>); in comparison, these interactions are not considered in PMI.\n*In lean construction, optimization efforts focus on making work flow reliable (Ballard, LPDS, 2000); in contrast PMI focuses on improving productivity of each activity which can make errors and reducing quality and result in rework.\n*The project is structured and managed as a value generating process (value is defined as satisfying customer requirements);<ref name = howell-1999/> while PMI considers less cost as value.\n*In the [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] approach, downstream stakeholders are involved in front end planning and design through cross functional teams (Ballard, LPDS, 2000). PMI doesn\u2019t consider this issue.\n*In lean construction, project control has the job of execution (Ballard, PhD thesis, 2000<ref name =ballard-thesis/>); whereas, control in PMI method relies on variance detection after-the-fact.\n*In the lean approach, pull techniques govern the [[Value stream mapping|flow]] of information and materials, from upstream to downstream;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> with PMI, push techniques govern the release of information and materials.\n*Capacity and inventory are adjusted to absorb variation ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]). Feedback loops, included at every level, help ensure minimal inventories and rapid system response;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> in comparison, PMI doesn\u2019t consider adjustments.\n*Lean construction tries to mitigate variation in every aspect (product quality, rate of work) and manage the remaining variation, while PMI doesn\u2019t consider variation mitigation and management.<ref name =ballard-thesis/>\n*Lean approach tries to make continuous improvements in the process, workflows and product;<ref name = howell-1999/> whereas PMI approach doesn\u2019t pay that much attention to continuous improvement.\n*In lean construction, decision making is distributed in design production control systems;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> by comparison, in PMI decision making is centered to one manager some times.\n*Lean construction tries to increase transparency between the stakeholders, managers and labourers, in order to know the impact of their work on the whole project;<ref name = howell-1999/> on the other hand, PMI doesn\u2019t consider transparency in its methods.\n*In lean construction a buffer of sound assignments is maintained for each crew or production unit;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> in contrast, PMI method doesn\u2019t consider a backlog for crews.\n*Lean construction is developing new forms of commercial contracts to give incentives to suppliers for reliable work flow and optimization at the deliverable-to-the-client level;<ref name = howell-1999/> while PMI doesn\u2019t have such policy.\n*Lean construction production system design resists the tendency toward local suboptimization,<ref name =ballard-thesis/> however, PMI persists on optimizing each activity.\n*The PMI-driven approach only considers managing a project at the macro-level.  This is necessary but not sufficient for the success of projects.  Lean Construction encompasses Project and Production Management, and formally recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.

Unlike manufacturing, construction is a project-based production process. Lean Construction is concerned with the alignment and holistic pursuit of concurrent and continuous improvements in all dimensions of the built and natural environment: design, construction, activation, maintenance, salvaging, and recycling (Abdelhamid 2007, Abdelhamid et al. 2008).  This approach tries to manage and improve construction processes with minimum cost and maximum value by considering customer needs (Koskela et al. 2002<ref name = koskela-et-al-2002 />), while it helps to achieve and maintain sustainability in construction sector (Solaimani & Sedighi, 2019<ref>Solaimani, S., & Sedighi, M.

Analysis of project plan failures indicated that \"normally only about 50% of the tasks on weekly work plans are completed by the end of the plan week\" and that constructors could mitigate most of the problems through \"active management of variability, starting with the structuring of the project (temporary production system) and continuing through its operation and improvement,\" (Ballard and Howell 2003<ref name = ballard-and-howell-2003>{{cite conference | last1= Ballard| first1= Glenn | last2= Howell | first2= Gregory | title= Competing Construction Management Paradigms| booktitle = Proceedings of the 2003 ASCE Construction Research Congress | date = 19\u201321 March 2003 | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/LCJ_04_0008.pdf | format = pdf | pages = | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}</ref>).\n\nEvidence from research and observations indicated that the conceptual models of Construction Management and the tools it utilizes ([[work breakdown structure]], [[critical path method]], and [[earned value management]]) fail to deliver projects 'on-time, at budget, and at desired quality' (Abdelhamid 2004).  With recurring negative experiences on projects, evidenced by endemic quality problems and rising litigation, it became evident that the governing principles of construction management needed revisiting. One comment published by the [[Construction Management Association of America|CMAA]], in its ''Sixth Annual Survey of Owners'' (2006), pointed to concern about work methods and the cost of waste: <blockquote>\"While the cost of steel and cement are making headlines, the less publicized failures in the management of construction projects can be disastrous. Listen carefully to the message in this comment. We are not talking about just materials, methods, equipment, or contract documents. We are talking about how we work to deliver successful capital projects and how we manage the costs of inefficiency.\"<ref name = sixth-annual-survey>{{cite web | year = 2006 | title = Sixth Annual Survey of Owners | url = http://www.cmaafoundation.org/files/surveys/2005-survey.pdf | author = FMI/CMAA | publisher = Construction Management Association of America | accessdate = 31 March 2013}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===A new paradigm===\nKoskela (2000)<ref name = koskela-thesis/> argued that the mismatch between the conceptual models and observed reality underscored the lack of robustness in the existing constructs and signaled the need for a theory of production in construction. Koskela then used the ideal production system embodied in the [[Toyota Production System]] to develop a more overarching production [[management paradigm]] for project-based production systems where production is conceptualized in three complementary ways, namely, as a Transformation (T), as a Flow (F), and as Value generation (V).\n: '''Transformation''' is the production of inputs into outputs.<ref name = koskela-thesis/>\n\n: '''Flow''' can be defined as \"Movement that is smooth and uninterrupted, as in the 'flow of work from one crew to the next' or the flow of value at the Pull of the customer.\"<ref name = lci-glossary/>\n\n: '''Value''' is \"What the Customer is actually paying for the project to produce and install.\"<ref name = lci-glossary>{{Cite web |url=http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |title=LCI Glossary |access-date=2009-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227061851/http://leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |archive-date=2009-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nKoskela and Howell (2002) also presented a review of existing management theory \u2013 specifically as related to the planning, execution, and control paradigms \u2013 in project-based production systems. Both conceptualizations provide a solid intellectual foundation of lean construction as evident from both research and practice (Abdelhamid 2004).\n\nRecognizing that construction sites reflect prototypical behavior of complex and chaotic systems, especially in the flow of both material and information on and off site, Bertelsen (2003a and 2003b) suggested that construction should be modeled using chaos and complex systems theory.\nBertelsen (2003b) specifically argued that construction could and should be understood in three complementary ways:\n* As a project-based production process\n* As an industry that provides autonomous agents\n* As a social system\n\n==What is Lean Construction?==\nThe term ''lean construction'' was coined by the [[International Group for Lean Construction]] in its first meeting in 1993 (Gleeson et al. 2007).  Greg Howell and Glenn Ballard (founders of the Lean Construction Institute in 1997) both maintain that ''Construction'' in ''Lean Construction'' refers to the entire industry and not the phase during which construction takes place.  Thus, Lean Construction is for owners, architects, designers, engineers, constructors, suppliers & end users.\n\nIn any case, the term Lean Construction has escaped canonical definition.  There has been a number of reasons for that.  The body of knowledge is in a state of development since 1990.  Nonetheless, a definition is needed to be able to operationalize the concepts and principles contained in the philosophy.  It is insightful to study the change of definition over time as that represents the evolution and advancement in the state of knowledge about Lean Construction.  \n\nThe reference to Lean Construction as a proper noun is not an attempt to falsely distinguish it from other areas that focus on construction project management. It is a proper noun because it refers to a very specific set of concepts, principles, and practices that are distinct from conventional design and construction management practices .\n\nA number of groups have proposed definitions: The International Group for Lean Construction; The Lean Construction Institute; The Associated General Contractors of America; Construction Management Association of America, and others.  Researchers have also put forward definitions as foundation for their work and to invite others to add, modify and critique. A sampling is provided here.\n\nLean Construction is a \u201cway to design production systems to minimize waste of materials, time, and effort in order to generate the maximum possible amount of value,\" (Koskela et al. 2002<ref name = koskela-et-al-2002>{{cite book | last1 =Koskela | first1 =L.\n | last2 =Howell | first2 = G.\n | last3 =Ballard | first3 =G.\n | last4 =Tommelein | first4 =I. | author-link = | author2-link = | chapter = Foundations of Lean Construction | title = Design and Construction: Building in Value | editor1-last = Best | editor1-first = Rick | editor2-last = de Valence | editor2-first = Gerard | place = Oxford, UK | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann, Elsevier | year = 2002 | month= | edition = | chapterurl = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0750651490}}</ref>).  Designing a production system to achieve the stated ends is only possible through the collaboration of all project participants (Owner, A/E, contractors, Facility Managers, End-user) at early stages of the project.  This goes beyond the contractual arrangement of design/build or constructability reviews where contractors, and sometime facility managers, merely react to designs instead of informing and influencing the design (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).\n\nLean Construction recognizes that desired ends affect the means to achieve these ends, and that available means will affect realized ends (Lichtig 2004).  Essentially, Lean Construction aims to embody the benefits of the Master Builder concept (Abdelhamid et al. 2008).\n\n\"One can think of lean construction in a way similar to [[mesoeconomics]]. Lean construction draws upon the principles of project-level management and upon the principles that govern production-level management. Lean construction recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.\" (Abdelhamid 2007)\n\nLean construction supplements traditional construction management approaches with (Abdelhamid 2007): (1) two critical and necessary dimensions for successful capital project delivery by requiring the deliberate consideration of material and information flow and value generation in a production system; and (2) different project and production management (planning-execution-control) paradigms.\n\nWhile lean construction is identical to lean production in spirit, it is different in how it was conceived as well as how it is practiced. There is a view that \"adaptation\" of Lean Manufacturing/Production forms the basis of Lean Construction.  The view of Lauri Koskela, Greg Howell, and Glenn Ballard is very different, with the origin of lean construction arising mainly from the need for a production theory in construction and anomalies that were observed in the reliability of weekly [[production planning]].\n\nGetting work to flow reliably and predictably on a construction site requires the impeccable alignment of the entire supply chain responsible for constructed facilities such that value is maximized and waste is minimized.  With such a broad scope, it is fair to say that tools found in Lean Manufacturing and Lean Production, as practiced by Toyota and others, have been adapted to be used in the fulfillment of Lean construction principles. TQM, [[Statistical process control|SPC]], six-sigma, have all found their way into lean construction. Similarly, tools and methods found in other areas, such as in social science and business, are used where they are applicable. The tools and methods in construction management, such as CPM and work breakdown structure, etc., are also utilized in lean construction implementations. The three unique tools and methods that were specifically conceived for lean construction are the Last Planner System, Target Value Design, and the Lean Project Delivery System.\n\nIf the tool, method, and/or technique will assist in fulfilling the aims of lean construction, it is considered a part of the toolkit available for use.  A sampling of these tools includes: [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Lean Design), A3, process design (Lean Design), offsite fabrication and [[Just in time (business)|JIT]] (Lean Supply), [[Value stream mapping|value chain mapping]] (Lean Assembly), visual site (Lean Assembly); [[5S (methodology)|5S]] (Lean Assembly), daily crew [[Stand-up meeting|huddles]] (Lean Assembly).\n\nThe priority for all construction work is to:\n# Keep work flowing so that the crews are always productive installing product\n# Reduce inventory of material and tools and\n# Reduce costs<ref name = sowards-2004>{{cite journal | url = http://contractormag.com/technology/cm_newsarticle_456 | last= Sowards | first= Dennis | title= 5S's that would make any CEO Happy | journal= Contractor Magazine |date=June 2004 | accessdate= 31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile lean construction\u2019s main tool for making design and construction processes more predictable is the '''Last Planner System''' ([[#Last_Planner_System|see below]]) and derivatives of it, other lean tools already proven in manufacturing have been adapted to the construction industry with equal success. These include: [[5S (methodology)|5S]], [[Kanban]], [[Kaizen]] events, [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die|quick setup/changeover]], [[Poka-yoke|Poka Yoke]], [[visual control]] and [[5 Whys]] (Mastroianni and Abdelhamid 2003, Salem et al. 2005<ref name = salem-et-al-2005>{{cite journal | url =http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/V2_N2/LCJ_05_009.pdf |date=October 2005 | volume = 2 | issue = 2\n | last1= Salem \n | first1= O\n | last2= Solomon \n | first2= J \n | last3= Genaidy \n | first3= A \n | last4= Luegring\n | first4= M\n | title= Site Implementation and Assessment of Lean Construction Techniques \n | journal=Lean Construction | pages = 1\u201321 | publisher= | issn = 1555-1369\n | location = | format = pdf | accessdate= 29 March 2013}}</ref>).\n\n==Early involvement of contractors and suppliers==\nThe early involvement of contractors and suppliers is seen as a key differentiator for construction so called 'best practice'.<ref>{{cite book | year = 2004 | last = Cain | first = Clive | title = Profitable partnering for lean construction | isbn = 1405110864 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Blackwell}}</ref> While there are Trade Marked business processes (see below), academics have also addressed related concepts such as 'early contractor involvement' (ECI).<ref>{{cite conference | last1 = Walker | first1 = D.H.T | last2 = Lloyd-Walker | first2 = B | title = Understanding Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) procurement forms | editor-last =  Smith | editor-first = S | conference  = Procs 28th Annual ARCOM Conference | date = 3\u20135 September 2012 | url = http://www.arcom.ac.uk/-docs/proceedings/ar2012-0877-0887_Walker_Lloyd-Walker.pdf | location =  Edinburgh, UK | publisher = Association of Researchers in Construction Management | pages = 877\u2013887}}</ref>\n\n===Integrated Project Delivery===\n Primary IPD team members include the owner, architect, key technical consultants, general contractor and key subcontractors.{{citation needed | date = July 2013}}\n\nUsing IPD, project participants can overcome key organizational and contractual problems. The IPD approach to contracting aligns project objectives with the interests of key participants. IPD relies on participant selection, transparency and continuing dialog. Construction consumers might consider rethinking their contracting strategies to share more fully in the benefits. The IPD approach creates an organization with the ability to apply [[Lean Project Delivery]] (LPD) principles and practices.

The resulting supply chain management toolset was tested and refined on two pilot projects and the comprehensive and detailed process-based toolset was published in 2000 as the 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials'.  The project demonstrated very clearly that lean thinking would only deliver major performance improvements if the construction sector learned from the extensive experience of other business sectors. Lean thinking must become the way that all the firms in the design and construction supply chain co-operate with each other at a strategic level that over-arches individual projects. In the aerospace sector, these long-term supply-side relationships are called a '[[Virtuality|Virtual]] Company', in other business sectors they are called an 'Extended Lean Enterprise'.\n\nThe UK 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials' states that: 'The commercial core of supply chain management is setting up long-term relationships based on improving the value of what the supply chain delivers, improving quality and reducing underlying costs through taking out waste and inefficiency. This is the opposite of 'business as usual' in the construction sector, where people do things on project after project in the same old inefficient ways, forcing each other to give up profits and overhead recovery in order to deliver at what seems the market price. What results is a fight over who keeps any of the meagre margins that result from each project, or attempts to recoup 'negative margins' through 'claims', The last thing that receives time or energy in this desperate, project-by-project gladiatorial battle for survival is consideration of how to reduce underlying costs or improve quality'.\n\n==Last Planner System==\nThe Last Planner System, as developed by the Lean Construction Institute,{{citation needed |date = April 2013}} is: <blockquote>The collaborative, commitment-based planning system that integrates should-can-will-did planning (pull planning, make-ready, look-ahead planning) with constraint analysis, weekly work planning based upon reliable promises, and learning based upon analysis of PPC (plan percent complete) and reasons for variance.<ref>[http://www.leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm ''Glossary''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227061851/http://leanconstruction.org/glossary.htm |date=2009-02-27 }} Lean Construction Institute</ref></blockquote>\n\nUsers such as owners, clients or construction companies, can use LPS to achieve better performance in design and construction through increased '''schedule/programme predictability''' (i.e. work is completed as and when promised).{{citation needed |date = April 2013}}\n\nLPS is a system of inter-related elements, and full benefits come when all are implemented together. It is based on simple paper forms, so it can be administered using [[Post-it note]]s, paper, pencil, eraser and photocopier. A spreadsheet can help.\n\nLPS begins with '''collaborative scheduling/programming''' engaging the main project suppliers from the start. Risk analysis ensures that float is built in where it will best protect programme integrity and predictability.  Where appropriate the process can be used for ''programme compression'' too. In this way, one constructor took 6 weeks out of an 18-week programme for the construction of a 40 bed hotel.  Benefits to the client are enormous.\n\n[[Image:Intense discussion during a programme compression workshop.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 1: intense discussion during a programme compression workshop'''\n\nBefore work starts, team leaders '''make tasks ready''' so that when work should be done, it can be.  Why put work into production if a pre-requisite is missing?  This ''MakeReady'' process continues throughout the project.\n\n[[Image:Part of MakeReady form.jpg]] <br />\n'''Figure 2: part of a MakeReady form for documenting the process of making tasks ready (this one for use in design)'''\n\nThere is a '''weekly work planning''' (WWP) meeting involving all the last planners \u2013 design team leaders and/or trade supervisors on site.  It is in everyone\u2019s interest to explore inter-dependencies between tasks and prevent colleagues from over-committing.\n\n[[Image:Part of a Weekly Work Plan form.png]]<br />\n'''Figure 3: part of a Weekly Work Plan form used by trade foremen on site or design team leaders to prepare for the WWP meeting'''.\n\nThis weekly work planning processes is built around ''promises''.  The agreed programme defines when tasks ''should'' be done and acts as a request to the supplier to do that task.  The ''last planners'' (that is the trade foremen on site or design team leaders in a design process) only promise once they have clarified the conditions of satisfaction and are clear that the task '''can''' be done.\n\n[[Image:The promise cycle.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 4: the promise cycle (after [[Fernando Flores]])'''\n\nOnce the task is complete the last planner responsible declares completion so that site management or the next trade can assure themselves that it is complete to an appropriate standard.\n\nA key measure of the success of the Last Planner system is '''PPC'''.  This measures the ''Percentage of Promises Completed'' on time.  As PPC increases. project productivity and profitability increase, with step changes at around 70% and 85%.  This score is measured site-wide and displayed around the site.  Weekly measures are used by the project and by individual suppliers as the basis for learning how to improve the predictability of the work programme and hence the PPC scores.\n\nA key part of the '''continual improvement''' process is a study of the reasons why tasks promised in the WWP are delivered late.  The following chart shows typical reasons:\n\n[[Image:Example of a reasons Pareto chart.jpg]]<br />\n'''Figure 5: example of a reasons Pareto chart'''\n\nRecording the reasons in a [[Pareto chart]] like the one above makes it easy to see where attention is most likely to yield the most results.  Using tools like 5 Why analysis and cause-effect diagrams will help the team understand how they can improve the clarity of information and ensure that there are sufficient operatives.\n\nLast Planner benefits don\u2019t stop at project predictability, profit and productivity; it contributes to positive changes in other industry KPIs. Danish research {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} shows almost half the accidents and up to 70% less sickness absence on LPS managed sites.\n\nLCI retains a registered Trademark on the term and Copyright in the idea and materials to prevent people who misunderstand or misrepresent the system from using it in trade. Consulting companies or individuals wishing to use the Last Planner System in trade (commercial offering of service) must first be approved by LCI. Consultants are expected to make financial and other contributions to LCI in recognition of the work and effort LCI put into developing Last Planner.\n\nLast Planner System development continues under the direction of Lean Construction Institute Directors [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822194259/http://www.leanconstruction.org/ballardbio.htm Professor Glenn Ballard] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20010909115359/http://leanconstruction.org/howellbio.htm Greg Howell] with support from users around the world. For more information about the development process see Ballard (1994,<ref name = ballard-1994/> 2000) and Ballard and Howell (2004) for example.\n\nFor a detailed description and list of the benefits of LPS, see ''Mossman: Last Planner\u00ae: 5 + 1 crucial & collaborative conversations for predictable design & construction delivery''<ref>[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3369275/Mossman-Last-Planner.pdf Mossman-Last-Planner.pdf]</ref> and for additional references see the Designing Buildings wiki.<ref>http://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/The_Last_Planner_System</ref>\n\n==Differences between LC and project management approaches==\nThere are many differences between the Lean Construction (LC) approach and the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) approach to construction. These include:\n\n*Managing the interaction between activities and combined effects of dependence and variation, is a first concern in lean construction because their interactions highly affects the time and cost of projects (Howell, 1999<ref name = howell-1999>{{cite conference | last= Howell | first= Gregory A. | year = 1999 | title = What is Lean Construction | publisher = Lean Construction Institute | url= http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/Howell.pdf | booktitle = Proceedings IGLC-7 | pages= 1\u201310 | format= pdf | accessdate= 31 March 2013}}</ref>); in comparison, these interactions are not considered in PMI.\n*In lean construction, optimization efforts focus on making work flow reliable (Ballard, LPDS, 2000); in contrast PMI focuses on improving productivity of each activity which can make errors and reducing quality and result in rework.\n*The project is structured and managed as a value generating process (value is defined as satisfying customer requirements);<ref name = howell-1999/> while PMI considers less cost as value.\n*In the [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] approach, downstream stakeholders are involved in front end planning and design through cross functional teams (Ballard, LPDS, 2000). PMI doesn\u2019t consider this issue.\n*In lean construction, project control has the job of execution (Ballard, PhD thesis, 2000<ref name =ballard-thesis/>); whereas, control in PMI method relies on variance detection after-the-fact.\n*In the lean approach, pull techniques govern the [[Value stream mapping|flow]] of information and materials, from upstream to downstream;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> with PMI, push techniques govern the release of information and materials.\n*Capacity and inventory are adjusted to absorb variation ([[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]). Feedback loops, included at every level, help ensure minimal inventories and rapid system response;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> in comparison, PMI doesn\u2019t consider adjustments.\n*Lean construction tries to mitigate variation in every aspect (product quality, rate of work) and manage the remaining variation, while PMI doesn\u2019t consider variation mitigation and management.<ref name =ballard-thesis/>\n*Lean approach tries to make continuous improvements in the process, workflows and product;<ref name = howell-1999/> whereas PMI approach doesn\u2019t pay that much attention to continuous improvement.\n*In lean construction, decision making is distributed in design production control systems;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> by comparison, in PMI decision making is centered to one manager some times.\n*Lean construction tries to increase transparency between the stakeholders, managers and labourers, in order to know the impact of their work on the whole project;<ref name = howell-1999/> on the other hand, PMI doesn\u2019t consider transparency in its methods.\n*In lean construction a buffer of sound assignments is maintained for each crew or production unit;<ref name =ballard-thesis/> in contrast, PMI method doesn\u2019t consider a backlog for crews.\n*Lean construction is developing new forms of commercial contracts to give incentives to suppliers for reliable work flow and optimization at the deliverable-to-the-client level;<ref name = howell-1999/> while PMI doesn\u2019t have such policy.\n*Lean construction production system design resists the tendency toward local suboptimization,<ref name =ballard-thesis/> however, PMI persists on optimizing each activity.\n*The PMI-driven approach only considers managing a project at the macro-level.  This is necessary but not sufficient for the success of projects.  Lean Construction encompasses Project and Production Management, and formally recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.
