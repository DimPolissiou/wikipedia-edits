{"title_page": "Web scraping", "text_new": "{{short description|Data scraping used for extracting data from websites}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2017}}\n{{broader|Data scraping}}\n'''Web scraping''', '''web harvesting''', or '''web data extraction''' is [[data scraping]] used for [[data extraction|extracting data]] from [[website]]s. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]], or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a [[Internet bot|bot]] or [[web crawler]]. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local [[database]] or spreadsheet, for later [[data retrieval|retrieval]] or [[data analysis|analysis]].\n\nWeb scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be [[Parsing|parsed]], searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).\n\nWeb scraping is used for [[contact scraping]], and as a component of applications used for [[web indexing]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]], online price change monitoring and [[Comparison shopping website|price comparison]], product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, [[Change detection and notification|website change detection]], research, tracking online presence and reputation, [[web mashup]] and, [[web data integration]].\n\n[[Web page]]s are built using text-based mark-up languages ([[HTML]] and [[XHTML]]), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form.  However, most web pages are designed for human [[End-user (computer science)|end-users]] and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. Companies like [[Amazon AWS]] and [[Google]] provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users.\n\nNewer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers.  For example, [[JSON]] is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.\n\nThere are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in  [[Document Object Model|DOM]] parsing, [[computer vision]] and [[natural language processing]] to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe history of the web scraping dates back nearly to the time when the Internet was born.\n\n* After the birth of [[History of the World Wide Web|'''World Wide Web''']] in 1989, the first web robot<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.searchenginehistory.com/ |title=Search Engine History.com |website=Search Engine History |access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref>, '''[[World Wide Web Wanderer]]''', was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.\n* In December 1993, the first '''crawler-based web search engine''', [[JumpStation]], was launched. As there were not so many websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on their human website administrators to collect and edit the links into a particular format. In comparison, JumpStation brought a new leap, being the first WWW search engine that relied on a web robot. \n* In 2000, the '''first Web API and API crawler''' came. [[Application programming interface|API]] stands for '''Application Programming Interface'''. It is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks.\u00a0In 2000, [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]] and [[eBay]] launched their own API, with which programmers were enabled to access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.\n\\\n\n== Techniques ==\nWeb scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the [[semantic web]] vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and [[human-computer interaction]]s. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.\n\n=== Human copy-and-paste ===\n\nSometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human\u2019s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\n\n=== Text pattern matching ===\n\nA simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX [[grep]] command or [[regular expression]]-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance [[Perl]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]]).\n\n=== HTTP programming ===\n\n[[Static web page|Static]] and [[dynamic web page]]s can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using [[socket programming]].\n\n=== HTML parsing ===\n\nMany websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a [[Wrapper (data mining)|wrapper]]. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Ruihua|author2=Microsoft Research|title=Joint Optimization of Wrapper Generation and Template Detection|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4fb4/3c5a212df751e84c3b2f8d29fabfe56c3616.pdf|journal=The 13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining|date=Sep 14, 2007}}</ref> Moreover, some [[semi-structured data]] query languages, such as [[XQuery]] and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n\n=== DOM parsing ===\n{{Further information|Document Object Model}}\n\nBy embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the [[Internet Explorer]] or the [[Mozilla]] browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the DOM tree.\n\n=== Vertical aggregation ===\n\nThere are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \u201cbots\u201d for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the [[Long Tail]] of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\n\n=== Semantic annotation recognizing ===\n\nThe pages being scraped may embrace [[metadata]] or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as [[Microformat]] does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<ref>[http://www.gooseeker.com/en/node/knowledgebase/freeformat Semantic annotation based web scraping<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n\n=== Computer vision web-page analysis ===\n\nThere are efforts using [[machine learning]] and [[computer vision]] that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2012/07/25/diffbot-is-using-computer-vision-to-reinvent-the-semantic-web/\n|title=Diffbot Is Using Computer Vision to Reinvent the Semantic Web\n|accessdate=2013-03-15\n|first=Wade|last=Roush\n|date=2012-07-25\n|publisher=www.xconomy.com\n}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\n\nThere are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.\n\n== Legal issues ==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=October 2015}}\nThe legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the [[terms of use]] of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID596\n|title=FAQ about linking&nbsp;\u2013 Are website terms of use binding contracts?\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|publisher=www.chillingeffects.org\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20020308222536/http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID596\n|archivedate =2002-03-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, website owners can use three major [[Cause of action|legal claims]] to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] (\u201cCFAA\u201d), and (3) [[Trespass to chattels|trespass to chattel]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kenneth|first=Hirschey, Jeffrey|date=2014-01-01|title=Symbiotic Relationships: Pragmatic Acceptance of Data Scraping|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/btlj/vol29/iss4/16/|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=29|issue=4|doi=10.15779/Z38B39B|issn=1086-3818}}</ref> However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|''Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service'']] that duplication of facts is allowable.\n\nU.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing [[trespass to chattels]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch06.html\n|title=Internet Law, Ch. 06: Trespass to Chattels\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|work =\n|publisher=www.tomwbell.com\n|pages =\n|language =\n|doi =\n|quote =\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID460\n|title=What are the \"trespass to chattels\" claims some companies or website owners have brought?\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|publisher=www.chillingeffects.org\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20020308222536/http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID460\n|archivedate =2002-03-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, ''[[eBay v. Bidder's Edge]]'', resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as [[auction sniping]]. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to [[Personal property|chattels]], the [[plaintiff]] must demonstrate that the [[defendant]] intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch07/Ticketmaster.html\n|title=Ticketmaster Corp. v.

The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/American+Airlines,+FareChase+Settle+Suit.-a0103213546|title=American Airlines, FareChase Settle Suit.|accessdate=2012-02-26\n|date=2003-06-13|publisher=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be [[US Copyright law]], and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company [[Yahoo!]], and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.<ref name=\"impervawp2011\">Imperva (2011).

Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in ''[[Craigslist v. 3Taps]]''. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].\n\nAlthough these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled, and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner\u2019s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.findlaw.com/2003/Jul/29/132944.html\n|title=Controversy Surrounds 'Screen Scrapers': Software Helps Users Access Web Sites But Activity by Competitors Comes Under Scrutiny|accessdate=2010-10-27\n|first=Kenneth A.|last=Adler|date=2003-07-29}}</ref>\n\nWhile the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.

Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]], or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a [[Internet bot|bot]] or [[web crawler]]. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local [[database]] or spreadsheet, for later [[data retrieval|retrieval]] or [[data analysis|analysis]].\n\nWeb scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be [[Parsing|parsed]], searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).\n\nWeb scraping is used for [[contact scraping]], and as a component of applications used for [[web indexing]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]], online price change monitoring and [[Comparison shopping website|price comparison]], product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, [[Change detection and notification|website change detection]], research, tracking online presence and reputation, [[web mashup]] and, [[web data integration]].\n\n[[Web page]]s are built using text-based mark-up languages ([[HTML]] and [[XHTML]]), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form.  However, most web pages are designed for human [[End-user (computer science)|end-users]] and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. Companies like [[Amazon AWS]] and [[Google]] provide web scraping tools, services and public data available free of cost to end users.\n\nNewer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers.  For example, [[JSON]] is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.\n\nThere are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in  [[Document Object Model|DOM]] parsing, [[computer vision]] and [[natural language processing]] to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe history of the web scraping dates back nearly to the time when the Internet was born.\n\n* After the birth of [[History of the World Wide Web|'''World Wide Web''']] in 1989, the first web robot<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.searchenginehistory.com/ |title=Search Engine History.com |website=Search Engine History |access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref>, '''[[World Wide Web Wanderer]]''', was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.\n* In December 1993, the first '''crawler-based web search engine''', [[JumpStation]], was launched. As there were not so many websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on their human website administrators to collect and edit the links into a particular format. In comparison, JumpStation brought a new leap, being the first WWW search engine that relied on a web robot. \n* In 2000, the '''first Web API and API crawler''' came. [[Application programming interface|API]] stands for '''Application Programming Interface'''. It is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks.\u00a0In 2000, [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]] and [[eBay]] launched their own API, with which programmers were enabled to access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.\n\\\n\n== Techniques ==\nWeb scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the [[semantic web]] vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and [[human-computer interaction]]s. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.\n\n=== Human copy-and-paste ===\n\nSometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human\u2019s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\n\n=== Text pattern matching ===\n\nA simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX [[grep]] command or [[regular expression]]-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance [[Perl]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]]).\n\n=== HTTP programming ===\n\n[[Static web page|Static]] and [[dynamic web page]]s can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using [[socket programming]].\n\n=== HTML parsing ===\n\nMany websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a [[Wrapper (data mining)|wrapper]]. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Ruihua|author2=Microsoft Research|title=Joint Optimization of Wrapper Generation and Template Detection|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4fb4/3c5a212df751e84c3b2f8d29fabfe56c3616.pdf|journal=The 13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining|date=Sep 14, 2007}}</ref> Moreover, some [[semi-structured data]] query languages, such as [[XQuery]] and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n\n=== DOM parsing ===\n{{Further information|Document Object Model}}\n\nBy embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the [[Internet Explorer]] or the [[Mozilla]] browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages.\n\n=== Vertical aggregation ===\n\nThere are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \u201cbots\u201d for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the [[Long Tail]] of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\n\n=== Semantic annotation recognizing ===\n\nThe pages being scraped may embrace [[metadata]] or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as [[Microformat]] does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<ref>[http://www.gooseeker.com/en/node/knowledgebase/freeformat Semantic annotation based web scraping<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n\n=== Computer vision web-page analysis ===\n\nThere are efforts using [[machine learning]] and [[computer vision]] that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2012/07/25/diffbot-is-using-computer-vision-to-reinvent-the-semantic-web/\n|title=Diffbot Is Using Computer Vision to Reinvent the Semantic Web\n|accessdate=2013-03-15\n|first=Wade|last=Roush\n|date=2012-07-25\n|publisher=www.xconomy.com\n}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\n\nThere are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.\n\n== Legal issues ==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=October 2015}}\nThe legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the [[terms of use]] of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID596\n|title=FAQ about linking&nbsp;\u2013 Are website terms of use binding contracts?\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|publisher=www.chillingeffects.org\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20020308222536/http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID596\n|archivedate =2002-03-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, website owners can use three major [[Cause of action|legal claims]] to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] (\u201cCFAA\u201d), and (3) [[Trespass to chattels|trespass to chattel]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kenneth|first=Hirschey, Jeffrey|date=2014-01-01|title=Symbiotic Relationships: Pragmatic Acceptance of Data Scraping|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/btlj/vol29/iss4/16/|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=29|issue=4|doi=10.15779/Z38B39B|issn=1086-3818}}</ref> However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|''Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service'']] that duplication of facts is allowable.\n\nU.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing [[trespass to chattels]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch06.html\n|title=Internet Law, Ch. 06: Trespass to Chattels\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|work =\n|publisher=www.tomwbell.com\n|pages =\n|language =\n|doi =\n|quote =\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID460\n|title=What are the \"trespass to chattels\" claims some companies or website owners have brought?\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|publisher=www.chillingeffects.org\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20020308222536/http://www.chillingeffects.org/linking/faq.cgi#QID460\n|archivedate =2002-03-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, ''[[eBay v. Bidder's Edge]]'', resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as [[auction sniping]]. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to [[Personal property|chattels]], the [[plaintiff]] must demonstrate that the [[defendant]] intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch07/Ticketmaster.html\n|title=Ticketmaster Corp. v.

FareChase\n|accessdate=2007-08-20\n|date=2007-08-20\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131832/http://www.fornova.net/documents/AAFareChase.pdf\n|archivedate =2011-07-23\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> AA successfully obtained an [[injunction]] from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/American+Airlines,+FareChase+Settle+Suit.-a0103213546|title=American Airlines, FareChase Settle Suit.|accessdate=2012-02-26\n|date=2003-06-13|publisher=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be [[US Copyright law]], and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company [[Yahoo!]], and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.<ref name=\"impervawp2011\">Imperva (2011).

Imperva white paper..</ref>\nIn 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in ''[[Craigslist v. 3Taps]]''. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].\n\nAlthough these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled, and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner\u2019s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.findlaw.com/2003/Jul/29/132944.html\n|title=Controversy Surrounds 'Screen Scrapers': Software Helps Users Access Web Sites But Activity by Competitors Comes Under Scrutiny|accessdate=2010-10-27\n|first=Kenneth A.|last=Adler|date=2003-07-29}}</ref>\n\nWhile the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.

This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below.

Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.\n* Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic\n* Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a [[CAPTCHA]]. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges.\n* Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web [[application firewall]]s have limited bot detection capabilities as well.

As a result, small government is associated with conservatism in contemporary [[New Zealand politics]].\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nThe idea of small government was heavily promoted in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]]. There are differing views on the extent to which it was achieved. It allowed the stock markets and industries to compete more heavily with each other and made British goods more valued in world trade.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAn important part of the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government's policy was [[privatization|privatisation]], which was intended to reduce the role of the state in the economy and allow industries to act without government interference. Supporters blamed excessive [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] for much of Britain's economic woes during the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOpponents argue that privatisation harms social programs for the poor. This argument is particularly heard in connection with the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railways]] and the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Small government supporters, such as the British author and journalist James Bartholomew, point out that although record amounts of funding have gone into social security, public education, council housing and the NHS, it has been detrimental to the people it was intended to help and does not represent value for investment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bartholomew|first=James|title=The Welfare State We're In|publisher=Biteback Publishing|ISBN=978-1849544504}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, small government was generally associated with the Conservative Party and big government with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nIn addition to opposing government intervention in the economy, advocates of small government oppose government intervention in people's personal lives. The Labour government during the [[premiership of Tony Blair]] was criticized on this score, e.g. by giving unwanted advice about eating, drinking and smoking. This has been dubbed as the [[nanny state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n== United States ==\nAt the time the nation was founded, there was disagreement between the [[Federalist]]s who supported a strong federal government; and the [[Anti-Federalists]], who wanted a loose [[confederation]] of independent states. In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Jay]] explained why a strong federal government was necessary. Hamilton wrote: {{quote|Not to confer in each case a degree of power commensurate to the end would be to violate the most obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success.<ref>Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, ''The Federalist Papers'', p. 151, Signet Classics, 2003</ref>|sign=|source=}} [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] said: {{quote|[A] wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.<ref>First Inaugural Address, given at the Capitol Building, Washington, DC, Wednesday, March 4, 1801</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe modern small government movement in the United States is largely a product of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[presidency of Ronald Reagan|presidency]] from 1981 to 1989. Reagan declared himself a [[small-government conservative]] and famously said: {{quote|Government is not a solution to our problem; government is the problem.<ref>[http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/reagans-first-inaugural-government-is-not-the-solution-to-our-problem-government-is-the-problem \"Reagan's First Inaugural: \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem\"].

As a result, small government is associated with conservatism in contemporary [[New Zealand politics]].\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nThe idea of small government was heavily promoted in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]]. There are differing views on the extent to which it was achieved. It allowed the stock markets and industries to compete more heavily with each other and made British goods more valued in world trade.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAn important part of the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government's policy was [[privatization|privatisation]], which was intended to reduce the role of the state in the economy and allow industries to act without government interference. Supporters blamed excessive [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] for much of Britain's economic woes during the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOpponents argue that privatisation harms social programs for the poor. This argument is particularly heard in connection with the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railways]] and the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Small government supporters, such as the British author and journalist James Bartholomew, point out that although record amounts of funding have gone into social security, public education, council housing and the NHS, it has been detrimental to the people it was intended to help and does not represent value for investment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bartholomew|first=James|title=The Welfare State We're In|publisher=Biteback Publishing|ISBN=978-1849544504}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, small government was generally associated with the Conservative Party and big government with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nIn addition to opposing government intervention in the economy, advocates of small government oppose government intervention in people's personal lives. The Labour government during the [[premiership of Tony Blair]] was criticized on this score, e.g. by giving unwanted advice about eating, drinking and smoking. This has been dubbed as the [[nanny state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n== United States ==\nAt the time the nation was founded, there was disagreement between the [[Federalist]]s who supported a strong federal government; and the [[Anti-Federalists]], who wanted a loose [[confederation]] of independent states. In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Jay]] explained why a strong federal government was necessary. Hamilton wrote: {{quote|Not to confer in each case a degree of power commensurate to the end would be to violate the most obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success.<ref>Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, ''The Federalist Papers'', p. 151, Signet Classics, 2003</ref>|sign=|source=}} [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] said: {{quote|[A] wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.<ref>First Inaugural Address, given at the Capitol Building, Washington, DC, Wednesday, March 4, 1801</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe modern small government movement in the United States is largely a product of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[presidency of Ronald Reagan|presidency]] from 1981 to 1989. Reagan declared himself a [[small-government conservative]] and famously said: {{quote|Government is not a solution to our problem; government is the problem.<ref>[http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/reagans-first-inaugural-government-is-not-the-solution-to-our-problem-government-is-the-problem \"Reagan's First Inaugural: \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem\"].

Generally, members of the Tea Party support the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and often run against moderate Republicans in the primary elections.\n\nThe [[Libertarian Republican|libertarian]]-wing of the Republican Party as with the [[Liberty Caucus]] which includes politicians such as [[Ron Paul]] and his son [[Rand Paul|Rand]], is particularly strong in its support of small government. It is contrasted to the [[neoconservative]]-wing which favors large [[Military budget of the United States|defense spending]] and the [[Christian right]] which wants a federal government that would enforce what they see as Christian morality.\n\nA 2013 Gallup poll showed that the majority (54%) of Americans think the government is trying to do too much.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=Majority in U.S. Still Say Government Doing Too Much|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157481/majority-say-government-doing.aspx|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Conservatism}}\n* [[Big government]]\n* [[Limited government]]\n* [[Lean government]]\n* [[Minarchism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.centerforsmallgovernment.com/ Center for Small Government]\n* [http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/small-is-best/ Report and video comparing small and big governments by the CPS]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Small Government}}\n[[Category:Conservatism]]\n[[Category:Minarchism]]\n[[Category:Political philosophy]]\n", "name_user": "Drevolt", "label": "safe", "comment": "Punctuation, wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_government"}

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but did otherwise minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The system initially weakened while crossing the state and emerging into the Atlantic, but surface observations along the North Carolina coastline supported peak winds around 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) as the storm accelerated northeast; it is possible the cyclone possessed hurricane-force winds offshore. By 00:00&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;1, the system transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] as an [[occluded front]] became attached to the circulation.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but did otherwise minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

At 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;20, a hurricane was conclusively identified about halfway between Cabo Verde and the [[Leeward Islands]]. It gained strength on a general northwest heading, intensifying into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane and attaining peak winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) on September 24\u201325. Slight weakening occurred as the system passed well north of Bermuda. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;26 and struck Nova Scotia before turning northeast across Newfoundland and into the northern Atlantic.

From October 16\u201317, a cold front moved eastward across the basin. An area of low pressure formed along the southern end of the dissipating boundary, initially harboring characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. This low became more symmetric while also intensifying, therefore transitioning into a hurricane by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19 while located roughly 715&nbsp;miles (1,150&nbsp;km) southeast of Newfoundland. The system attained peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) within six hours and weakened shortly thereafter while moving west-northwest. It fell to tropical storm intensity by early on October&nbsp;20; by 00:00&nbsp;UTC the next day, there were no further indications of the storm. It either dissipated or was absorbed by a front encroaching from the west.<ref name=\"Meta\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other storms===\nIn addition to the eleven known tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength in the Atlantic in 1937, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project also identified five [[tropical depression]]s. The first of these lasted from August&nbsp;1\u20134 over the central Atlantic without affecting land, ultimately degenerating into a tropical wave. A second tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico and passed near New Orleans, Louisiana, on August&nbsp;29. A nearly stationary tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September&nbsp;29 and dissipated two days later; it may have been absorbed by [[#Tropical Storm Ten|Tropical Storm Ten]]. This system was originally included in the [[HURDAT|official Atlantic hurricane track database]] as a tropical storm, but was found to have winds of only 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) by the reanalysis. On October&nbsp;8, a northward-moving tropical depression spawned from a tropical wave well east of the Lesser Antilles, eventually transitioning into an extratropical system on October&nbsp;14. The season's final tropical cyclone was a nearly stationary tropical depression that persisted in the central Caribbean Sea between October&nbsp;25\u201329. The reanalysis project also examined eleven other disturbances from 1937 for possible tropical or subtropical cyclone characteristics, including a low-pressure system that split from a front over the open Atlantic on January&nbsp;1.<ref name=\"Meta\" />\n\n==Season effects==\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1937 Atlantic hurricane season.
