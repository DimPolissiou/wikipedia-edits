As engineered by [[Alec Issigonis]], the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump &mdash; despite disparate lubricating requirements &mdash; and had the engine's radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine.

In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.<ref name=Greats/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Road test==\nThe British \"[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]\" magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded.

Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978.
