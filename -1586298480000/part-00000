{"title_page": "Rosh yeshiva", "text_new": "'''Rosh yeshiva''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4}}, [[plural|pl]]. {{lang-he-n|\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4}} , ''{{transl|he|roshei yeshiva}}'', plural ''rosh yeshivahs'') is the title given to the dean of a [[yeshiva]], a Jewish educational institution that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law). It is a [[compound word]] of the Hebrew words ''rosh'' (\"head\") and ''yeshiva'' (a school of religious Jewish education). The rosh yeshiva is required to have a comprehensive knowledge of the Talmud and the ability to analyse and present new perspectives, called ''[[chidush]]im'' ([[wikt:novellae|novellae]]) verbally and often in print.\n\n==Role==\nThe primary role of the rosh yeshiva is not simply to be the dean, but is generally to give the highest-level lecture in the yeshiva, which is usually a program of at least two years. Students who have studied in a yeshiva are generally known as \"students of the Rosh Yeshiva\", as his lecture is the one in which they usually attain their method of Talmudic analysis and critical reasoning, and this method is based on the particular style of that rosh yeshiva. In addition, since yeshivas play a central role in the life of certain communities within [[Orthodox Judaism]], the position of rosh yeshiva is more than just his position within the yeshiva. A rosh yeshiva is often seen as a pillar of leadership in extended communities. In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the role of rosh yeshiva is secondary to the [[Rebbe]], who is head of the Hasidic dynasty that controls it. In many Hasidic groups, the rosh yeshiva of a school will be the son or son-in-law of the rebbe, the assumed heir of the rebbe. However, the role that yeshivohs have within Hasidic communities is not nearly as important as it is in Lithuanian Jewish ([[Litvishe]]) communities. Hasidic students usually get married at the age of 18, which \u2013 in most cases \u2013 is the end of their yeshiva education. Students in the Lithuanian Jewish communities typically continue to study until they get married starting at around age 23, with the vast majority continuing their studies in a [[Kollel]] after marriage. As a result, the role that a rosh yeshiva plays in Lithuanian Jewish communities is much more important than in the Hasidic ones.\n\n==History==\nYeshivas continue the scholarly traditions of the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] who often headed academies with hundreds of students. In the [[Talmudic academies in Babylonia]], the rosh yeshiva was referred to as the ''reish [[metivta]]'' (\"head of the academy\" in [[Aramaic]]) and had the title of ''[[Geonim|gaon]]''. Regard for the rosh yeshiva in many ways is the transplantation of Hasidic attitudes in the Lithuanian world. \n\n==General role==\nThe general role of the rosh yeshiva is to oversee the Talmudic studies and [[halakha|practical]] matters. The rosh yeshiva will often give the highest ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'' (class). He is also the one to decide whether to grant permission for students to undertake classes for rabbinical ordination, known as ''[[semicha]]''.\n\n==Dynasties==\nDepending on the size of the yeshiva, there may be several rosh yeshivas, sometimes from one extended family. There are familial dynasties of rosh yeshivas, for example, the [[Soloveitchik]], [[Finkel]], [[Feinstein]], [[Kotler]], and [[Kook (disambiguation)|Kook]] families, which head many yeshivas in the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].\n\n==Famous rosh yeshivas==\nPrior to [[the Holocaust]], most of the large yeshivas were based in [[Eastern Europe]].

GObject is designed for use both directly in [[C (programming language)|C]] programs to provide object-oriented C-based APIs and through [[language binding|binding]]s to other languages to provide transparent cross-language interoperability, e.g. [[PyGObject]].\n\n==GObject Introspection==\n* [https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection GObject introspection] is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and language bindings, cf. [[List of language bindings for GTK]].\n\n==History==\nDepending only on [[GLib]] and [[libc]], GObject is a cornerstone of [[GNOME]] and is used throughout [[GTK]], [[Pango]], [[Accessibility Toolkit|ATK]], and most higher-level [[GNOME]] libraries like [[GStreamer]] and applications. Prior to GTK+ 2.0, code similar to GObject was part of the GTK codebase. (The name \u201cGObject\u201d was not yet in use &mdash; the common baseclass was called <code>GtkObject</code>.)\n\nAt the release of GTK+ 2.0, the object system was extracted into a separate library due to its general utility. In the process, most non-[[GUI]]-specific parts of the <code>GtkObject</code> class were moved up into <code>GObject</code>, the new common baseclass. Having existed as a separate library since March 11, 2002 (the release date of GTK+ 2.0), the GObject library is now used by many non-GUI programs such as [[command-line]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] applications.\n\n==Relation to GLib==\nThough GObject has its own separate set of documentation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/|title=GObject Reference Manual}}</ref> and is usually compiled into its own [[shared library]] file, the source code for GObject resides in the [[GLib]] source tree and is distributed along with GLib. For this reason, GObject uses the GLib version numbers and is typically packaged together with GLib (for example, [[Debian]] puts GObject in its <code>libglib2.0</code> package family).\n\n==The type system==\nAt the most basic level of the GObject framework lies a generic and dynamic [[type system]] called GType. The GType system holds a runtime description of all objects allowing [[glue code]] to facilitate multiple language bindings. The type system can handle any [[single inheritance|singly inherited]] class structure, in addition to ''non-classed'' types such as [[opaque pointer]]s, [[string (computer science)|strings]], and variously sized [[integer]]s and [[floating point number]]s.\n\nThe type system knows how to copy, assign, and destroy values belonging to any of the registered types. This is trivial for types like integers, but many complex objects are [[reference counting|reference-counted]], while some are complex but not reference-counted. When the type system \u201ccopies\u201d a reference-counted object, it will typically just increase its reference count, whereas when copying a complex, non-reference-counted object (such as a string), it will typically create an actual copy by [[memory allocation|allocating memory]].\n\nThis basic functionality is used for implementing <code>GValue</code>, a type of generic container that can hold values of any type known by the type system. Such containers are particularly useful when interacting with dynamically typed language environments in which all native values reside in such [[tagged union|type-tagged]] containers.\n\n===Fundamental types===\nTypes that do not have any associated [[class (programming)|class]]es are called ''non-classed''. These types, together with all types that correspond to some form of [[root class]], are known as ''fundamental types'': the types from which all other types are derived. These make up a relatively closed set, but although the average user is not expected to create their own fundamental types, the possibility does exist and has been exploited to create custom [[class hierarchy|class hierarchies]] &mdash; i.e., class hierarchies not based on the <code>GObject</code> class.\n\nAs of GLib 2.9.2,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable|title=GObject Reference Manual - Stable}}</ref> the ''non-classed'' built-in fundamental types are:\n* an empty type, corresponding to C's <code>void</code> (<code>G_TYPE_NONE</code>);\n* types corresponding to C's signed and unsigned <code>char</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and 64-bit integers (<code>G_TYPE_CHAR</code>, <code>G_TYPE_UCHAR</code>, <code>G_TYPE_INT</code>, <code>G_TYPE_UINT</code>, <code>G_TYPE_LONG</code>, <code>G_TYPE_ULONG</code>, <code>G_TYPE_INT64</code>, and <code>G_TYPE_UINT64</code>);\n* a boolean type (<code>G_TYPE_BOOLEAN</code>);\n* an enumeration type and a \u201cflags\u201d type, both corresponding to C's <code>enum</code> type, but differing in that the latter is only used for [[bit field]]s (<code>G_TYPE_ENUM</code> and <code>G_TYPE_FLAGS</code>);\n* types for single- and double-precision [[IEEE float]]s, corresponding to C's <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> (<code>G_TYPE_FLOAT</code> and <code>G_TYPE_DOUBLE</code>);\n* a string type, corresponding to C's <code>char *</code> (<code>G_TYPE_STRING</code>);\n* an opaque pointer type, corresponding to C's <code>void *</code> (<code>G_TYPE_POINTER</code>).\n\nThe ''classed'' built-in fundamental types are:\n* a base class type for instances of <code>GObject</code>, the root of the standard class inheritance tree (<code>G_TYPE_OBJECT</code>)\n* a base interface type, analogous to the base class type but representing the root of the standard ''interface'' inheritance tree (<code>G_TYPE_INTERFACE</code>)\n* a type for [[Boxed type|boxed]] structures, which are used to wrap simple value objects or foreign objects in reference-counted \u201cboxes\u201d (<code>G_TYPE_BOXED</code>)\n* a type for \u201cparameter specification objects,\u201d which are used in GObject to describe [[metadata]] for object properties (<code>G_TYPE_PARAM</code>).\n\nTypes that can be instantiated automatically by the type system are called ''instantiable''. An important characteristic of these types is that the first bytes of any instance always contain a pointer to the ''class structure'' (a form of [[virtual table]]) associated to the type of the instance. For this reason, any instantiable type must be classed. Contrapositively, any non-classed type (such as ''integer'' or ''string'') must be non-instantiable. On the other hand, most classed types are instantiable, but some, such as interface types, are not.\n\n===Derived types===\nThe types that are derived from the built-in GObject fundamental types fall\nroughly into four categories:\n; Enumerated types and \u201cflags\u201d types : In general, every enumerated type and every integer-based bitfield type (i.e., every <code>enum</code> type) that one wishes to use in some way that is related to the object system &mdash; for example, as the type of an object property &mdash; should be registered with the type system. Typically, the initialization code that takes care of registering these types is generated by an automated tool called <code>glib-mkenums</code><ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/glib-mkenums.html|title=glib-mkenums, GObject Reference Manual}}</ref> and stored in a separate file.\n; Boxed types : Some data structures that are too simple to be made full-fledged class types (with all the overhead incurred) may still need to be registered with the type system. For example, we might have a class to which we want to add a <code>background-color</code> property, whose values should be instances of a structure that looks like {{code|2=c|1=struct color { int r, g, b; } }}. To avoid having to subclass <code>GObject</code>, we can create a [[boxed type]] to represent this structure, and provide functions for copying and freeing. GObject ships with a handful of boxed types wrapping simple GLib data types. Another use for boxed types is as a way to wrap foreign objects in a tagged container that the type system can identify and will know how to copy and free.\n; Opaque pointer types : Sometimes, for objects that need to be neither copied or reference-counted nor freed, even a boxed type would be [[Overkill (term)|overkill]]. While such objects can be used in GObject by simply treating them as opaque pointers (<code>G_TYPE_POINTER</code>), it is often a good idea to create a derived pointer type, documenting the fact that the pointers should reference a particular kind of object, even though nothing else is said about it.\n; Class and interface types : Most types in a GObject application will be classes &mdash; in the normal object-oriented sense of the word &mdash; derived directly or indirectly from the root class, <code>GObject</code>. There are also interfaces, which, unlike classic [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-style interfaces, can contain implemented methods. GObject interfaces can thus be described as [[mixin]]s.\n\n==Messaging system==\nThe GObject messaging system consists of two complementary parts: ''closures'' and ''signals''.\n; Closures : A GObject closure is a generalized version of a [[Callback (computer science)|callback]]. Support exists for closures written in C and C++, as well as arbitrary languages (when bindings are provided). This allows code written in (for example) Python and Java to be invoked via a GObject closure.\n; Signals : Signals are the primary mechanism by which closures are invoked. Objects register signal listeners with the type system, specifying a mapping between a given signal and a given closure. Upon emission of a registered signal, that signal's closure is invoked. In GTK, all native GUI events (such as mouse motion and keyboard actions) can generate GObject signals for listeners to potentially act upon.\n\n==Class implementation==\nEach GObject class is implemented by at least two structures: the ''class structure'' and the ''instance structure''.\n; The class structure : The class structure corresponds to the [[vtable]] of a C++ class. It must begin with the class structure of the superclass. Following that, it will hold a set of function pointers &mdash; one for each [[virtual method]] of the class. Class-specific variables can be used to emulate class members.\n; The instance structure : The instance structure, which will exist in one copy per object instance, must begin with the instance structure of the [[superclass (computer science)|superclass]] (this ensures that all instances begin with a pointer to the class structure, since all fundamental instantiable types share this property). After the data belonging to the superclass, the structure can hold any instance-specific variables, corresponding to C++ member variables.\n\nDefining a class in the GObject framework is complex, requiring large amounts of [[boilerplate (text)#Boilerplate code|boilerplate]] code, such as manual definitions of type casting macros and obscure type registration incantations. Also, since a C structure cannot have access modifiers like \u201cpublic\u201d, \u201cprotected\u201d, or \u201cprivate\u201d, workarounds must be used to provide [[Encapsulation (computer programming)|encapsulation]]. One approach is to include a pointer to the private data &mdash; conventionally called <code>_priv</code> &mdash; in the instance structure. The ''private structure'' can be declared in the public header file, but defined only in the implementation file, with the effect that the private data is opaque to users, but transparent to the implementor. If the private structure is registered with GType, it will be automatically allocated by the object system. Indeed, it is not even necessary to include the <code>_priv</code> pointer, if one is willing to use the incantation <code>G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE</code> every time the private data is needed.\n\nTo address some of these complexities, several higher-level languages exist that [[source-to-source compiler|source-to-source compiles]] to GObject in C.

GObject is designed for use both directly in [[C (programming language)|C]] programs to provide object-oriented C-based APIs and through [[language binding|binding]]s to other languages to provide transparent cross-language interoperability, e.g. [[PyGObject]].\n\n==GObject Introspection==\n* [https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection GObject introspection] is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and language bindings, cf. [[List of language bindings for GTK]].\n\n==History==\nDepending only on [[GLib]] and [[libc]], GObject is a cornerstone of [[GNOME]] and is used throughout [[GTK]], [[Pango]], [[Accessibility Toolkit|ATK]], and most higher-level [[GNOME]] libraries like [[GStreamer]] and applications. Prior to GTK+ 2.0, code similar to GObject was part of the GTK codebase. (The name \u201cGObject\u201d was not yet in use &mdash; the common baseclass was called <code>GtkObject</code>.)\n\nAt the release of GTK+ 2.0, the object system was extracted into a separate library due to its general utility. In the process, most non-[[GUI]]-specific parts of the <code>GtkObject</code> class were moved up into <code>GObject</code>, the new common baseclass. Having existed as a separate library since March 11, 2002 (the release date of GTK+ 2.0), the GObject library is now used by many non-GUI programs such as [[command-line]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] applications.\n\n==Relation to GLib==\nThough GObject has its own separate set of documentation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/|title=GObject Reference Manual}}</ref> and is usually compiled into its own [[shared library]] file, the source code for GObject resides in the [[GLib]] source tree and is distributed along with GLib. For this reason, GObject uses the GLib version numbers and is typically packaged together with GLib (for example, [[Debian]] puts GObject in its <code>libglib2.0</code> package family).\n\n==The type system==\nAt the most basic level of the GObject framework lies a generic and dynamic [[type system]] called GType. The GType system holds a runtime description of all objects allowing [[glue code]] to facilitate multiple language bindings. The type system can handle any [[single inheritance|singly inherited]] class structure, in addition to ''non-classed'' types such as [[opaque pointer]]s, [[string (computer science)|strings]], and variously sized [[integer]]s and [[floating point number]]s.\n\nThe type system knows how to copy, assign, and destroy values belonging to any of the registered types. This is trivial for types like integers, but many complex objects are [[reference counting|reference-counted]], while some are complex but not reference-counted. When the type system \u201ccopies\u201d a reference-counted object, it will typically just increase its reference count, whereas when copying a complex, non-reference-counted object (such as a string), it will typically create an actual copy by [[memory allocation|allocating memory]].\n\nThis basic functionality is used for implementing <code>GValue</code>, a type of generic container that can hold values of any type known by the type system. Such containers are particularly useful when interacting with dynamically typed language environments in which all native values reside in such [[tagged union|type-tagged]] containers.\n\n===Fundamental types===\nTypes that do not have any associated [[class (programming)|class]]es are called ''non-classed''. These types, together with all types that correspond to some form of [[root class]], are known as ''fundamental types'': the types from which all other types are derived. These make up a relatively closed set, but although the average user is not expected to create their own fundamental types, the possibility does exist and has been exploited to create custom [[class hierarchy|class hierarchies]] &mdash; i.e., class hierarchies not based on the <code>GObject</code> class.\n\nAs of GLib 2.9.2,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable|title=GObject Reference Manual - Stable}}</ref> the ''non-classed'' built-in fundamental types are:\n* an empty type, corresponding to C's <code>void</code> (<code>G_TYPE_NONE</code>);\n* types corresponding to C's signed and unsigned <code>char</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and 64-bit integers (<code>G_TYPE_CHAR</code>, <code>G_TYPE_UCHAR</code>, <code>G_TYPE_INT</code>, <code>G_TYPE_UINT</code>, <code>G_TYPE_LONG</code>, <code>G_TYPE_ULONG</code>, <code>G_TYPE_INT64</code>, and <code>G_TYPE_UINT64</code>);\n* a boolean type (<code>G_TYPE_BOOLEAN</code>);\n* an enumeration type and a \u201cflags\u201d type, both corresponding to C's <code>enum</code> type, but differing in that the latter is only used for [[bit field]]s (<code>G_TYPE_ENUM</code> and <code>G_TYPE_FLAGS</code>);\n* types for single- and double-precision [[IEEE float]]s, corresponding to C's <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> (<code>G_TYPE_FLOAT</code> and <code>G_TYPE_DOUBLE</code>);\n* a string type, corresponding to C's <code>char *</code> (<code>G_TYPE_STRING</code>);\n* an opaque pointer type, corresponding to C's <code>void *</code> (<code>G_TYPE_POINTER</code>).\n\nThe ''classed'' built-in fundamental types are:\n* a base class type for instances of <code>GObject</code>, the root of the standard class inheritance tree (<code>G_TYPE_OBJECT</code>)\n* a base interface type, analogous to the base class type but representing the root of the standard ''interface'' inheritance tree (<code>G_TYPE_INTERFACE</code>)\n* a type for [[Boxed type|boxed]] structures, which are used to wrap simple value objects or foreign objects in reference-counted \u201cboxes\u201d (<code>G_TYPE_BOXED</code>)\n* a type for \u201cparameter specification objects,\u201d which are used in GObject to describe [[metadata]] for object properties (<code>G_TYPE_PARAM</code>).\n\nTypes that can be instantiated automatically by the type system are called ''instantiable''. An important characteristic of these types is that the first bytes of any instance always contain a pointer to the ''class structure'' (a form of [[virtual table]]) associated to the type of the instance. For this reason, any instantiable type must be classed. Contrapositively, any non-classed type (such as ''integer'' or ''string'') must be non-instantiable. On the other hand, most classed types are instantiable, but some, such as interface types, are not.\n\n===Derived types===\nThe types that are derived from the built-in GObject fundamental types fall\nroughly into four categories:\n; Enumerated types and \u201cflags\u201d types : In general, every enumerated type and every integer-based bitfield type (i.e., every <code>enum</code> type) that one wishes to use in some way that is related to the object system &mdash; for example, as the type of an object property &mdash; should be registered with the type system. Typically, the initialization code that takes care of registering these types is generated by an automated tool called <code>glib-mkenums</code><ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/glib-mkenums.html|title=glib-mkenums, GObject Reference Manual}}</ref> and stored in a separate file.\n; Boxed types : Some data structures that are too simple to be made full-fledged class types (with all the overhead incurred) may still need to be registered with the type system. For example, we might have a class to which we want to add a <code>background-color</code> property, whose values should be instances of a structure that looks like {{code|2=c|1=struct color { int r, g, b; } }}. To avoid having to subclass <code>GObject</code>, we can create a [[boxed type]] to represent this structure, and provide functions for copying and freeing. GObject ships with a handful of boxed types wrapping simple GLib data types. Another use for boxed types is as a way to wrap foreign objects in a tagged container that the type system can identify and will know how to copy and free.\n; Opaque pointer types : Sometimes, for objects that need to be neither copied or reference-counted nor freed, even a boxed type would be [[Overkill (term)|overkill]]. While such objects can be used in GObject by simply treating them as opaque pointers (<code>G_TYPE_POINTER</code>), it is often a good idea to create a derived pointer type, documenting the fact that the pointers should reference a particular kind of object, even though nothing else is said about it.\n; Class and interface types : Most types in a GObject application will be classes &mdash; in the normal object-oriented sense of the word &mdash; derived directly or indirectly from the root class, <code>GObject</code>. There are also interfaces, which, unlike classic [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-style interfaces, can contain implemented methods. GObject interfaces can thus be described as [[mixin]]s.\n\n==Messaging system==\nThe GObject messaging system consists of two complementary parts: ''closures'' and ''signals''.\n; Closures : A GObject closure is a generalized version of a [[Callback (computer science)|callback]]. Support exists for closures written in C and C++, as well as arbitrary languages (when bindings are provided). This allows code written in (for example) Python and Java to be invoked via a GObject closure.\n; Signals : Signals are the primary mechanism by which closures are invoked. Objects register signal listeners with the type system, specifying a mapping between a given signal and a given closure. Upon emission of a registered signal, that signal's closure is invoked. In GTK, all native GUI events (such as mouse motion and keyboard actions) can generate GObject signals for listeners to potentially act upon.\n\n==Class implementation==\nEach GObject class is implemented by at least two structures: the ''class structure'' and the ''instance structure''.\n; The class structure : The class structure corresponds to the [[vtable]] of a C++ class. It must begin with the class structure of the superclass. Following that, it will hold a set of function pointers &mdash; one for each [[virtual method]] of the class. Class-specific variables can be used to emulate class members.\n; The instance structure : The instance structure, which will exist in one copy per object instance, must begin with the instance structure of the [[superclass (computer science)|superclass]] (this ensures that all instances begin with a pointer to the class structure, since all fundamental instantiable types share this property). After the data belonging to the superclass, the structure can hold any instance-specific variables, corresponding to C++ member variables.\n\nDefining a class in the GObject framework is complex, requiring large amounts of [[boilerplate (text)#Boilerplate code|boilerplate]] code, such as manual definitions of type casting macros and obscure type registration incantations. Also, since a C structure cannot have access modifiers like \u201cpublic\u201d, \u201cprotected\u201d, or \u201cprivate\u201d, workarounds must be used to provide [[Encapsulation (computer programming)|encapsulation]]. One approach is to include a pointer to the private data &mdash; conventionally called <code>_priv</code> &mdash; in the instance structure. The ''private structure'' can be declared in the public header file, but defined only in the implementation file, with the effect that the private data is opaque to users, but transparent to the implementor. If the private structure is registered with GType, it will be automatically allocated by the object system. Indeed, it is not even necessary to include the <code>_priv</code> pointer, if one is willing to use the incantation <code>G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE</code> every time the private data is needed.\n\nTo address some of these complexities, several higher-level languages exist that [[source-to-source compiler|source-to-source compiles]] to GObject in C. The [[Vala (programming language)|Vala programming language]] uses a [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]-style syntax and is pre-processed into [[Vanilla (computing)|vanilla]] C code. The GObject Builder, or [https://www.jirka.org/gob.html GOB2], offers a template syntax reminiscent of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].\n\n==Usage==\nThe combination of C and GObject is used in many successful [[free software]] projects, such as the [[GNOME]] desktop, the [[GTK]] toolkit and the [[GIMP]] image manipulation program.\n\nThough many GObject applications are written entirely in C, the GObject system maps well into the native object systems of many other languages, like [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Common Lisp]], and [[.NET Framework|.NET]]/[[Mono (software)|Mono]].

Of course, other implementations of signals are available on almost all platforms, although sometimes an extra library is needed, such as Boost.Signals2 for C++.\n\n{{See also|IBM System Object Model#Comparison of Support for Compiled Class Libraries|l1=Comparison with COM, Objective-C, SOM, Windows Runtime, XPCOM}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]]\n* [[Genie (programming language)|Genie]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/ The GObject Reference Manual (and tutorial)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170202012725/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.gtk%2B.devel.general/6329 GObject Tutorial Aug 2004]\n* [https://www.jirka.org/gob.html GOB2 &mdash; the GObject Builder]\n* [https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala Vala Homepage]\n\n{{GTK}}\n\n<!-- Interlang -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gobject}}\n[[Category:C libraries]]\n[[Category:Free computer libraries]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in C]]\n[[Category:Freedesktop.org]]\n[[Category:GNOME libraries]]\n[[Category:GTK]]\n", "name_user": "Gavr123456789", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add more info to see also section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject"}

Initially a battalion, the South Belfast Brigade emerged from the local \"defence associations\" active in the city at the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. It subsequently emerged as the largest of the UDA's six brigades and expanded to cover an area much wider than its initial South Belfast borders.\n\n==Origins==\nIn the first days of the Troubles a number of local \"defence associations\" were established across Belfast by Protestants, ostensibly to protect against attacks from the IRA. Whilst South Belfast had fewer [[interface area]]s than the west or north of the city it nonetheless followed suit. An early example of such a group was the [[Donegall Road]] defence committee, although in contrast to the likes of the [[Shankill Defence Association]] in the west of the city, this group was loyal to [[Ian Paisley]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 15</ref>\n\nAccording to one unidentified founder member of the group, the meeting that saw the establishment of the UDA at Aberdeen Street Primary School on the [[Shankill Road]] in 1971 was not attended by any groups from the south of the city.<ref>Bruce, pp. 49-50</ref> Southern representatives however attended two subsequent meetings and came on board as part of the new group.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 20</ref> As such when the UDA in Belfast adopted a more formal structure the following year South Belfast was determined as one of the city's four battalions, along with East, North and West Belfast. Each of these areas was promoted to brigade status at an undetermined date soon afterwards.<ref name=\"McD24\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 24</ref> The earliest centre of activity for the UDA in South Belfast was [[Sandy Row]] close to [[Belfast city centre]], although it soon spread out to other areas of the city as well as to nearby towns such as [[Lisburn]], [[Dromara]] and [[Ballynahinch, County Down|Ballynahinch]].<ref name=\"McD24\"/>\n\n==Sandy Row UDA==\n[[File:Loyalist mural south Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy Row, 1981]]\nSammy Murphy emerged as the commander in Sandy Row, using the local [[Orange Order|Orange Hall]] as his headquarters.<ref name=\"fisk145148\">Fisk, Robert (1975). ''The Point of No Return: the strike which broke the British in Ulster''. London: Times Books. pp. 145-148</ref> In June 1972 he took the lead in a stand-off with republicans in [[Lenadoon]], an area in the southwest of the city but too far removed from the [[Shankill Road]] to be considered part of the West Belfast jurisdiction. With the [[Provisional IRA]] (IRA) on ceasefire the UDA hoped to use the incident to force them to break their truce to end negotiations between the IRA and the British government.<ref name=\"McD31\"/> With Protestant residents intimidated out of Horn Drive in Lenadoon, the IRA wanted to move in Catholics who had suffered a similar fate in other parts of the city. Murphy brought in a force of UDA members to prevent this and a stand-off ensued between the UDA and the Catholic would-be residents, with the British Army also in attendance. After a while the Catholics began throwing stones at the UDA.\n\n.<ref name=\"McD31\" />\n\nSoon IRA snipers entered the fray and a gun battle between the republicans and the British Army ensued. The UDA eventually withdrew. While Murphy believed his plan for bringing down the IRA ceasefire had been a success,<ref name=\"McD31\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 31</ref> the IRA leadership had already warned British government negotiators that the ceasefire would finish if the British Army failed to protect the homeless Catholics in Lenadoon. [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade]] leaders [[Seamus Twomey]] and [[Brendan Hughes]], who were especially eager to end the ceasefire because they believed the British were acting in bad faith, had laid careful plans to end it at Lenadoon if the soldiers entered the fray on the side of the loyalists.<ref>Peter Taylor, [https://books.google.dk/books?id=pf6BAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT137&lpg=PT137&dq=lenadoon+ira+ceasefire&source=bl&ots=0SmEaktbOU&sig=guLMx2f9wPN4XuIMbgPwytnHoQI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bceeVb-bB8XgyQOMl4HYCw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=lenadoon%20ira%20ceasefire&f=false The Provos: The IRA and Sinn Fein], A&C Black, 2014</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<ref>Ed Moloney, [https://books.google.dk/books?id=W2AeD_OacD4C&pg=PT216&lpg=PT216&dq=lenadoon+ira+ceasefire&source=bl&ots=31Eh8I6GyS&sig=yZCUswk1kotLd7G4sJeg-TBmBOc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bceeVb-bB8XgyQOMl4HYCw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=lenadoon%20ira%20ceasefire&f=false A Secret History of the IRA], Penguin UK, 2007</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe UDA in Sandy Row were also involved in \"rompering\", a nickname given by the UDA to the slow, torture-driven killings of kidnapped victims. On 30 August 1972 members of the group, as well as leading [[Woodvale Defence Association]] figure [[Ernie Elliott]], kidnapped Catholic former British soldier Patrick Devaney before taking him to Sandy Row where he was hung upside down from a beam and beaten with hammers before being shot in the back of the head.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 42</ref> The same group was responsible for one of the early UDA-on-UDA killings in December 1972 when members of the group shot and killed Ernie Elliott after a drunken argument about weapons that Elliott's men had loaned to the southern contingent.<ref>Bruce, p. 67</ref> According to later eyewitness reports Elliott had entered a UDA club in the area and began waving a gun about, with the weapon discharging during a struggle when others attempted to disarm him.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 34</ref> Another \"rompering\" death was also carried out in the area in July 1974 when a 32-year-old Protestant single mother [[Murder of Ann Ogilby|Ann Ogilby was killed]] by a UDA women's unit based in the area.<ref name=\"douglas\">[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/elizabeth-douglas-the-sandy-row-executioner-28215605.html Elizabeth Douglas, the Sandy Row executioner]</ref> Ogilby's interned boyfriend William Young was the local commander of the Donegall Pass UDA which came under the South Belfast UDA's auspices.

With few becoming involved in a proposed withdrawal of labour, the local UDA undertook a series of assaults and car burnings, before setting fire to a shop on the corner of Sandy Row. They then shot at the fire brigade when they arrived, killing Brian Douglas, a Protestant fireman, and precipitating a night of rioting and violence in both the south and east of the city.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 48</ref> The group also attacked nearby Durham Street, killing two Catholics from the area in quick succession in March 1973.<ref name=\"McD54\"/> [[Robert Fisk]], who worked as the Belfast correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' from 1972\u201375, suggested that the Sandy Row UDA was the one of the most bellicose of all the paramilitary units in Belfast during this period.<ref name=\"fisk145148\"/> [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] and [[Jim Cusack]] confirmed this, declaring that the Sandy Row and Donegall Pass UDA were almost out of control at the time, with both its men and women inured to killings and beatings.<ref name=\"mcdonald5758\">McDonald & Cusack, pp.57-58</ref>\n\n==Wider emergence==\nTowards the end of 1972 the UDA began to increase in importance in other areas of South Belfast, with the \"Village\" area of the [[Donegall Road]] becoming another centre of activity. A hit team was established here and in January 1973 they carried out four murders of Catholic youths from nearby West Belfast in quick succession. The youngest victim, Peter Watterson (aged 15), was mortally wounded in a drive-by shooting outside his mother's shop on the Falls Road/Donegall Road junction.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 52-53</ref> Soon afterwards however the IRA retaliated by capturing local commander Francis \"Hatchet\" Smith in Roden Street, close to his home, and fatally shooting him.<ref name=\"McD53\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 53</ref> With Smith dead, the UDA in South Belfast, which by that time was recognised as a brigade, stepped up its activity, kidnapping 14-year-old Philip Rafferty from his home in [[Andersonstown]] and taking him to the [[Giant's Ring]], where he was murdered.<ref name=\"McD53\"/> Gabriel Savage, a seventeen-year-old, was killed in similar circumstances soon afterwards.<ref name=\"McD54\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 54</ref>\n\nOther units began to emerge in [[Taughmonagh]] and [[Dunmurry]], with the former responsible for killing Daniel Rouse in June 1973, in an attack which saw the 17-year-old beaten severely before being shot.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 59</ref> The brigade was also active during the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]] of 1974, with the Village team killing a Catholic university student, Michael Mallon, at the height of strike.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 76</ref> Sammy Murphy and the Sandy Row UDA took a belligerent stance during the strike. They almost came to direct confrontation with the British Army over the removal of UDA roadblocks in the area and had made preparations to use force had the British Army smashed them. Murphy, who was described in military press releases as a community leader, successfully negotiated with the soldiers to defuse the explosive situation.<ref name=\"fisk145148\"/>\n\nGerard McWilliams, a young [[hippy]] from a Catholic background living in the [[Lisburn Road]], was beaten and stabbed to death in an entry near his home by South Belfast brigade members in September 1974 as he returned from a night out at the Club Bar, a popular student and bohemian venue near [[Queen's University Belfast]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 90</ref> Two months later a unit from Sandy Row shot and killed a bouncer from the same bar, which was Catholic-owned but entertained a mixed clientele.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 91</ref> Similar attacks continued into 1975, with a Sandy Row gunman killing a young Catholic builder on nearby Great Victoria Street, before another attack by the Sandy Row unit on 9 February when they entered St Bride's Catholic Church on the [[Malone Road]], a popular target for vandalism attacks by local loyalist youths, and killed two students in attendance.<ref name=\"McD94\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 94</ref> These killings helped to set off a bloody period over the following two years when both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups were highly active in tit-for-tat sectarian killings.<ref name=\"McD94\"/>\n\n==John McMichael==\n===1977-84===\n[[File:McMichael mural.png|thumb|right|McMichael depicted on a mural in Roden Street]]\nWith South Belfast formalised as a brigade, Lisburn-based [[John McMichael]] emerged as the brigadier and, due to his closeness to UDA leader [[Andy Tyrie]], soon became one of the most prominent figures within the wider movement.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 103-105</ref> Following the heavy activity of the years before, under the guidance of McMichael and Tyrie the UDA slowed down their run of killings. They were responsible for the deaths of three Catholics in 1977 and two in 1978.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 115</ref>\n\nThis changed in 1979, when a group of commando units was formed within the UDA under the name Ulster Defence Force (UDF), in order to take advantage of [[British Intelligence Corps]] documents that the UDA had obtained detailing the whereabouts of several republican leaders. Although the UDF was officially outside the UDA's brigade structure it was under the overall command of McMichael and included several of his most trusted South Belfast Brigade lieutenants within its ranks.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 116-117</ref> A notable action by the UDF, an attack on the home of [[Bernadette McAliskey]], was carried out by South Belfast members of the UDF, including McMichael's closest confidante [[Ray Smallwoods]].<ref name=\"McD118\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 118</ref> Tom Graham of [[Lisburn]] and Andrew Watson from Seymour Hill, Dunmurry, both parts of the South Belfast Brigade area, were subsequently convicted and imprisoned along with Smallwoods for the attack.<ref name=\"murray263\">Murray, Raymond (1990).

Acting directly under McMichael's command, Stone carried out a series of killings of both republican political activists and other Catholic civilians.<ref>Michael Stone, ''None Shall Divide Us'', John Blake Publishing, 2003, pp. 66-79</ref>\n\nJohn McMichael was killed by a bomb attached to his car outside his Hilden Court home, in Lisburn's loyalist Hilden estate, on 22 December 1987, shortly before his fortieth birthday. He was on his way to deliver Christmas turkeys to the families of loyalist prisoners.<ref name=\"wood128\">Wood, p. 128</ref> At 8:20{{small|pm}}, after he had turned on the ignition of his car and the vehicle slowly reversed down the driveway, the movement-sensitive switch in the detonating mechanism of the five pound booby-trap bomb attached to its underside was activated, and the device exploded. McMichael lost both legs in the blast and suffered grave internal injuries. He was rushed to Lagan Valley Hospital where he died two hours later.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 150</ref> The IRA claimed responsibility for the killing.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 157</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of killing===\nIn the late 1980s [[James Craig (loyalist)|James Craig]], who had been an important figure in the [[UDA West Belfast Brigade|West Belfast Brigade]], moved over to the South Belfast Brigade after being ordered to leave the Shankill Road. He operated as the \"chief collector\" for the brigade and his presence ensured that they became as associated with racketeering as West Belfast had been during his tenure with that brigade.<ref name=\"Bruce2467\">Bruce, pp. 246-247</ref> Craig was killed in October 1988 as part of an internal UDA feud, with rumours rife that he had been involved in setting up McMichael's assassination. Rumours suggested that McMichael had indicated his desire to tackle racketeering shortly before his death, although this suggestion is rejected by [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], who argues that as the rackets were profiting the brigade as a whole (as \"chief collector\" Craig was entitled to a percentage of everything<ref name=\"Bruce2467\"/>) there was no desire amongst the brigade leadership to cut off this source of revenue.<ref>Taylor, pp. 170-171</ref> Nonetheless, a number of arrests were made relating to the brigade's rackets and in January 1990 a number of sentences were handed down to several of Craig's former associates, with [[Jackie McDonald]] sentenced to ten years imprisonment for blackmail, intimidation and making threats to kill.<ref>Taylor, p. 171</ref>\n\n==Towards ceasefire==\nFollowing the deaths of McMichael and Craig, the UDA entered a period of disarray with much of the old leadership, including Tyrie, removed. One of Tyrie's last acts was to promote Jackie McDonald, at the time an unpopular figure due to his associations with Craig, to the role of South Belfast brigadier.<ref>Taylor, p. 170</ref> His tenure proved short-lived however, due to the aforementioned conviction in 1990 in relation to his links to Craig. McDonald did oversee one prominent killing that was implicated in collusion investigations. On 25 August 1989 [[Loughlin Maginn]], a Catholic from [[Rathfriland]] who was suspected by local loyalists of being an IRA member despite a lack of evidence, was killed by the South Belfast UDA. In a later interview McDonald would state he was sure Maginn was an IRA member, stating that his source was intelligence reports he had received from the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR). The killing was investigated as part of the [[Stevens Inquiries]] into allegations of collusion and it was determined that contact between UDR and UDA members had been instrumental in the murder. In March 1992 four men were sentenced to life for the murder, Geoffrey McCullough and Edward Jones of the UDA and Andrew Browned and Andrew Smith of the UDR.<ref>Taylor, pp. 205-206</ref>\n\n[[File:Annadale UFF.JPG|thumb|Ulster Freedom Fighters insignia continues to be displayed in the Annadale Flats]]\nMcDonald was succeeded as brigadier by [[Alex Kerr (loyalist)|Alex Kerr]], also a native of Taughmonagh.<ref>David Lister & Hugh Jordan, ''Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company'', Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2004, p. 127</ref> Kerr took over a brigade in an area where sectarian tensions were growing as the Catholic population of South Belfast had increased significantly and as a result more interface areas had sprung up.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 161</ref> In this climate the South Belfast Brigade, and in particular its Upper [[Ormeau Road|Ormeau]] members based in the Annadale flats, was to once again take a leading role in sectarian killings. Dominated by [[Joe Bratty]], Thomas \"Tucker\" Annett, Raymond Elder and Stephen \"Inch\" McFerran, this group carried out a number of killings in the early 1990s. Emmanuel Shields, a Catholic civilian who lived close to the Annadale flats and who was known personally to members of the Upper Ormeau UDA, was killed at his home on 7 September 1990. Shields had been beaten by future members of Bratty's team when they were children and had escaped a shooting attack at his mother's home years earlier.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 184</ref>\n\nIn 1990 South Belfast members also killed Tommy Casey, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] activist, at his home in [[Cookstown]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 186</ref> Although somewhat removed from South Belfast, this killing was part of a wider expansion of the South Belfast Brigade which by the early 1990s had expanded into Mid-[[Ulster]], where a brigade had existed on and off but had become moribund. South Belfast Brigade teams were based in South [[County Town|Down]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Lurgan]] and on the border at [[County Fermanagh]], as well as Cookstown.<ref name=\"McD187\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 187</ref> With these teams, Upper Ormeau, Lisburn and a combined Sandy Row/Village unit all active, the brigade was rivalled only by West Belfast in terms of ruthlessness in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"McD187\"/> The Village unit carried out the killing of a Catholic taxi driver, John O'Hara, on 17 April 1991, as part of a new UDA-wide policy of ringing known Catholic taxi firms to book a taxi and then shooting the driver when they arrived.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 188-189</ref> A notorious Lisburn hitman, known by the codename \"Gravedigger\", was also active on 25 May 1991 conducted a high-profile killing when he led a team that gunned down Sinn F\u00e9in councillor [[Eddie Fullerton]] at his home in [[County Donegal]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 192-193</ref> The policy of attacking Sinn F\u00e9in politicians had been developed by Ray Smallwoods, who had been released from prison and taken on a prominent role in both the [[Ulster Democratic Party]] (UDP) and the UDA, and it was followed soon after by the killing of Sinn F\u00e9in Councillor Bernard O'Hagan in [[Magherafelt]] by the Lisburn unit.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 205</ref> The Lisburn unit expanded significantly in 1991-2, launching a recruitment drive amongst teenagers in schools within its area. It carried out two more killings in early 1992.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 221-222</ref>\n\nIn February 1992 the brigade carried out the [[Sean Graham bookmakers' shooting]] in which five Catholic civilians were killed in a gun attack on the Ormeau Road.<ref>Taylor, p. 218</ref> Other killings that the group carried out included that of Michael Gilbride, a Catholic taxi driver who had settled in the Lower Ormeau area but who was killed outside his parents' home on Fernwood Street, not far from Bratty's Annadale Flats base.<ref>McDonald and Cusack, p. 238</ref><ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1992.html Sutton Index of Deaths 1992], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 23 November 2015.</ref> Donna Wilson, a Protestant and resident of Annadale Flats who had recently moved to the area from Tullycarnet in [[Dundonald, County Down|Dundonald]] was killed after residents had complained to Bratty in his role as local UDA commander about the noise of her stereo.

The two then pooled their resources in a new dissident group, the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF).<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 284</ref>\n\nJackie McDonald was again appointed brigadier, having been released from prison. McDonald faced an early challenge as relations with the local [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) deteriorated and threatened to break out into a [[loyalist feud]]. [[Robert Bates (loyalist)|Robert \"Basher\" Bates]] had been a member of the notorious [[Shankill Butchers]] and one of his killings had been that of UDA member James Curtis Moorhead, with whom he had got into an argument in a Shankill bar in 1977. Having become a [[born-again Christian]], Bates was released from prison and took a job at the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre on the Woodvale Road. Whilst outside the centre on 11 June 1997 a relative of Moorhead, who was himself a UDA member, approached Bates and shot him dead.<ref name=\"McD290\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 290</ref> Well-known locally, the killer was quickly identified and the UVF demanded he be given into their custody. However, following a meeting of the UDA's governing Inner Council (which McDonald, as South Belfast brigadier, attended) it was decided that the killer, who was highly regarded in the UDA, would be expelled from the Shankill and transferred to Taughmonagh as a member of the South Belfast Brigade.<ref name=\"McD290\"/> An attempt to kill him outside a bar on Sandy Row followed, leading to sour relations between the Sandy Row UDA and the Donegall Pass UVF.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 291</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a leading member of the Dunmurry UDA, Brian Morton, described in some contemporary reports as being the brigade's second-in-command, was killed when a [[pipe bomb]] he was making exploded prematurely.<ref>Wood, p. 201</ref> As part of a series of tit-for-tat killings in 1998, two members of the brigade, Jim Guiney and Robert Dougan, were killed by republicans.

Whilst supporting the [[Orange Order]]'s desire to march through [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] areas, McDonald was a lot less enthusiastic than Adair about getting involved in the [[Drumcree conflict]]. McDonald felt that mainstream [[Ulster unionism|unionist]] parties were playing too much of a role in Drumcree and publicly condemned their tendency to link up with loyalist paramilitaries when it suited them only to later drop them when their usefulness had expired.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 319</ref> Similarly he was unconvinced by a series of vandalism attacks on loyalist areas in Belfast in late June by three carloads of \"republicans\", feeling that the missile-throwing youths were actually members of Adair's C Company sent to stir up sectarian hatred and win support for Adair's Drumcree strategy.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 319-320</ref>\n\nMcDonald was one of a number of brigadiers to accept Adair's invitation to a \"Loyalist Day of Culture\" on the [[Shankill Road]] on 19 August 2000 but was shocked to find that C Company had used the day to drive UVF members and their families from the road, even attacking the homes of such UVF \"elder statesmen\" as [[Gusty Spence]] and [[Winston Churchill Rea]]. At the culmination of the day, McDonald and other brigadiers, as well as Deputy [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]] [[Frank McCoubrey]], were brought onto a makeshift stage where C Company members emerged and fired machine guns into the air in a show of strength.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 326-327</ref> McDonald had no desire to feud with the UVF and told his men to leave the Shankill that evening.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 330</ref> He promptly contacted his opposite number in the South Belfast UVF and concluded a pact that their members would not attack each other.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 336</ref>\n\nEven when the initial feud cooled, the enmity between McDonald and Adair continued to simmer and in Inner Council meetings the two frequently clashed as, according to one veteran loyalist, \"Jackie was the only one with the balls to stand up to him\".<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 370</ref> Nonetheless, when Adair was released from prison on 15 May 2002, McDonald, arguing that he deserved a second chance and hoping that his return to prison may have mellowed him, was one of the brigadiers to appear at Adair's Boundary Way home and welcome him back in front of the television cameras.<ref>Lister & Jordan, ''Mad Dog'', p. 303</ref>\n\nThe public display of amity between McDonald and Adair did not result in improved relations as time passed. On 14 September 2002, East Belfast LVF man Stephen Warnock was killed by the [[Red Hand Commando]] and immediately afterwards Adair, seeing an opportunity to strike back at a rival, went to his family home to inform visiting LVF members that the killing had been actually ordered by Jim Gray. With Adair's encouragement, an LVF hit team waited for Gray to appear at Warnock's house where, after he paid his respects to the family, he was shot in the face as he left. Gray was seriously injured but survived the attack.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 371-372</ref>\n\nMcDonald called a crisis meeting of brigadiers, including Adair, at [[Sandy Row]] but it failed to reach a conclusion as Adair denied involvement in the attack on Gray.<ref name=\"UDA374\"/> As soon as the meeting was over, Adair drove to Ballysillan in north Belfast to meet with allies in the LVF, although he was unaware that a mainstream UDA team were following him and recording his movements.<ref>Lister & Jordan, ''Mad Dog'', pp. 318-319</ref> When McDonald was told about this second meeting he secured agreement with the other brigadiers that Adair should be expelled from the UDA.<ref name=\"UDA374\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 374</ref> Tension simmered for the next few months with little real fighting although McDonald threw a ring of steel around his Taughmonagh stronghold and even obtained an [[air raid siren]] to be sounded if any C Company members attempted to enter the estate.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 375</ref>\n\nThe killing of John Gregg and his associate Rab Carson by C Company in [[Sailortown, Belfast|Sailortown]] on 1 February 2003 finally led to a showdown, with McDonald taking charge of the anti-Adair faction. McDonald quickly got word to A and B Company of the [[UDA West Belfast Brigade|West Belfast UDA]], covering the Highfield estate and Woodvale areas of the [[Greater Shankill]] and nominally under Adair's command, that Adair was to be removed and secured the loyalty of these two groups. He also told them to set up an office on the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club as a safe house where members of C Company could defect back to the mainstream UDA.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 383-384</ref>\n\nAt around 1{{small|am}} on 6 February 2003, about 100 heavily armed UDA members invaded the lower Shankill and set upon the twenty or so members of C Company who had remained loyal to Adair. For his part Adair fled the scene with his family and his close ally [[John White (loyalist)|John White]], ending his spell in charge on the Shankill.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 386</ref> Several weeks later McDonald organised a \"battle of the bands\" (competition between loyalist flute bands) at which he made it clear that unity had been re-established. He then received a standing ovation from those present as, marching behind a masked man carrying an [[AK 47]], McDonald led the other five brigadiers onto the stage.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 395</ref> The feud had effectively made McDonald de facto head of the UDA and had shifted power away from the west of the city to make the South Belfast Brigade the movement's most important.\n\n==Subsequent activity==\nAs head of both the South Belfast Brigade and effective leader of the UDA McDonald sought to move the group away from violence and announced in 2007 that the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a codename used by the UDA to refer to its killing wing, was to be stood down.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Jackie McDonald is widely regarded as the UDA's most senior figure.

Initially a battalion, the South Belfast Brigade emerged from the local \"defence associations\" active in the city at the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. It subsequently emerged as the largest of the UDA's six brigades and expanded to cover an area much wider than its initial South Belfast borders.\n\n==Origins==\nIn the first days of the Troubles a number of local \"defence associations\" were established across Belfast by Protestants, ostensibly to protect against attacks from the IRA. Whilst South Belfast had fewer [[interface area]]s than the west or north of the city it nonetheless followed suit. An early example of such a group was the [[Donegall Road]] defence committee, although in contrast to the likes of the [[Shankill Defence Association]] in the west of the city, this group was loyal to [[Ian Paisley]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 15</ref>\n\nAccording to one unidentified founder member of the group, the meeting that saw the establishment of the UDA at Aberdeen Street Primary School on the [[Shankill Road]] in 1971 was not attended by any groups from the south of the city.<ref>Bruce, pp. 49-50</ref> Southern representatives however attended two subsequent meetings and came on board as part of the new group.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 20</ref> As such when the UDA in Belfast adopted a more formal structure the following year South Belfast was determined as one of the city's four battalions, along with East, North and West Belfast. Each of these areas was promoted to brigade status at an undetermined date soon afterwards.<ref name=\"McD24\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 24</ref> The earliest centre of activity for the UDA in South Belfast was [[Sandy Row]] close to [[Belfast city centre]], although it soon spread out to other areas of the city as well as to nearby towns such as [[Lisburn]], [[Dromara]] and [[Ballynahinch, County Down|Ballynahinch]].<ref name=\"McD24\"/>\n\n==Sandy Row UDA==\n[[File:Loyalist mural south Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy Row, 1981]]\nSammy Murphy emerged as the commander in Sandy Row, using the local [[Orange Order|Orange Hall]] as his headquarters.<ref name=\"fisk145148\">Fisk, Robert (1975). ''The Point of No Return: the strike which broke the British in Ulster''. London: Times Books. pp. 145-148</ref> In June 1972 he took the lead in a stand-off with republicans in [[Lenadoon]], an area in the southwest of the city but too far removed from the [[Shankill Road]] to be considered part of the West Belfast jurisdiction. With the [[Provisional IRA]] (IRA) on ceasefire the UDA hoped to use the incident to force them to break their truce to end negotiations between the IRA and the British government.<ref name=\"McD31\"/> With Protestant residents intimidated out of Horn Drive in Lenadoon, the IRA wanted to move in Catholics who had suffered a similar fate in other parts of the city. Murphy brought in a force of UDA members to prevent this and a stand-off ensued between the UDA and the Catholic would-be residents, with the British Army also in attendance. After a while the Catholics began throwing stones at the UDA.\n\n.<ref name=\"McD31\" />\n\nSoon IRA snipers entered the fray and a gun battle between the republicans and the British Army ensued. The UDA eventually withdrew.

With few becoming involved in a proposed withdrawal of labour, the local UDA undertook a series of assaults and car burnings, before setting fire to a shop on the corner of Sandy Row. They then shot at the fire brigade when they arrived, killing Brian Douglas, a Protestant fireman, and precipitating a night of rioting and violence in both the south and east of the city.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 48</ref> The group also attacked nearby Durham Street, killing two Catholics from the area in quick succession in March 1973.<ref name=\"McD54\"/> [[Robert Fisk]], who worked as the Belfast correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' from 1972\u201375, suggested that the Sandy Row UDA was the one of the most bellicose of all the paramilitary units in Belfast during this period.<ref name=\"fisk145148\"/> [[Henry McDonald (writer)|Henry McDonald]] and [[Jim Cusack]] confirmed this, declaring that the Sandy Row and Donegall Pass UDA were almost out of control at the time, with both its men and women inured to killings and beatings.<ref name=\"mcdonald5758\">McDonald & Cusack, pp.57-58</ref>\n\n==Wider emergence==\nTowards the end of 1972 the UDA began to increase in importance in other areas of South Belfast, with the \"Village\" area of the [[Donegall Road]] becoming another centre of activity. A hit team was established here and in January 1973 they carried out four murders of Catholic youths from nearby West Belfast in quick succession.

Acting directly under McMichael's command, Stone carried out a series of killings of both republican political activists and other Catholic civilians.<ref>Michael Stone, ''None Shall Divide Us'', John Blake Publishing, 2003, pp. 66-79</ref>\n\nJohn McMichael was killed by a bomb attached to his car outside his Hilden Court home, in Lisburn's loyalist Hilden estate, on 22 December 1987, shortly before his fortieth birthday. He was on his way to deliver Christmas turkeys to the families of loyalist prisoners.<ref name=\"wood128\">Wood, p. 128</ref> At 8:20{{small|pm}}, after he had turned on the ignition of his car and the vehicle slowly reversed down the driveway, the movement-sensitive switch in the detonating mechanism of the five pound booby-trap bomb attached to its underside was activated, and the device exploded. McMichael lost both legs in the blast and suffered grave internal injuries. He was rushed to Lagan Valley Hospital where he died two hours later.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 150</ref> The IRA claimed responsibility for the killing.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 157</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of killing===\nIn the late 1980s [[James Craig (loyalist)|James Craig]], who had been an important figure in the [[UDA West Belfast Brigade|West Belfast Brigade]], moved over to the South Belfast Brigade after being ordered to leave the Shankill Road. He operated as the \"chief collector\" for the brigade and his presence ensured that they became as associated with racketeering as West Belfast had been during his tenure with that brigade.<ref name=\"Bruce2467\">Bruce, pp. 246-247</ref> Craig was killed in October 1988 as part of an internal UDA feud, with rumours rife that he had been involved in setting up McMichael's assassination. Rumours suggested that McMichael had indicated his desire to tackle racketeering shortly before his death, although this suggestion is rejected by [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], who argues that as the rackets were profiting the brigade as a whole (as \"chief collector\" Craig was entitled to a percentage of everything<ref name=\"Bruce2467\"/>) there was no desire amongst the brigade leadership to cut off this source of revenue.<ref>Taylor, pp. 170-171</ref> Nonetheless, a number of arrests were made relating to the brigade's rackets and in January 1990 a number of sentences were handed down to several of Craig's former associates, with [[Jackie McDonald]] sentenced to ten years imprisonment for blackmail, intimidation and making threats to kill.<ref>Taylor, p. 171</ref>\n\n==Towards ceasefire==\nFollowing the deaths of McMichael and Craig, the UDA entered a period of disarray with much of the old leadership, including Tyrie, removed. One of Tyrie's last acts was to promote Jackie McDonald, at the time an unpopular figure due to his associations with Craig, to the role of South Belfast brigadier.<ref>Taylor, p. 170</ref> His tenure proved short-lived however, due to the aforementioned conviction in 1990 in relation to his links to Craig. McDonald did oversee one prominent killing that was implicated in collusion investigations. On 25 August 1989 [[Loughlin Maginn]], a Catholic from [[Rathfriland]] who was suspected by local loyalists of being an IRA member despite a lack of evidence, was killed by the South Belfast UDA. In a later interview McDonald would state he was sure Maginn was an IRA member, stating that his source was intelligence reports he had received from the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR). The killing was investigated as part of the [[Stevens Inquiries]] into allegations of collusion and it was determined that contact between UDR and UDA members had been instrumental in the murder. In March 1992 four men were sentenced to life for the murder, Geoffrey McCullough and Edward Jones of the UDA and Andrew Browned and Andrew Smith of the UDR.<ref>Taylor, pp. 205-206</ref>\n\n[[File:Annadale UFF.JPG|thumb|Ulster Freedom Fighters insignia continues to be displayed in the Annadale Flats]]\nMcDonald was succeeded as brigadier by [[Alex Kerr (loyalist)|Alex Kerr]], also a native of Taughmonagh.<ref>David Lister & Hugh Jordan, ''Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company'', Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2004, p. 127</ref> Kerr took over a brigade in an area where sectarian tensions were growing as the Catholic population of South Belfast had increased significantly and as a result more interface areas had sprung up.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 161</ref> In this climate the South Belfast Brigade, and in particular its Upper [[Ormeau Road|Ormeau]] members based in the Annadale flats, was to once again take a leading role in sectarian killings. Dominated by [[Joe Bratty]], Thomas \"Tucker\" Annett, Raymond Elder and Stephen \"Inch\" McFerran, this group carried out a number of killings in the early 1990s. Emmanuel Shields, a Catholic civilian who lived close to the Annadale flats and who was known personally to members of the Upper Ormeau UDA, was killed at his home on 7 September 1990. Shields had been beaten by future members of Bratty's team when they were children and had escaped a shooting attack at his mother's home years earlier.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 184</ref>\n\nIn 1990 South Belfast members also killed Tommy Casey, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] activist, at his home in [[Cookstown]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 186</ref> Although somewhat removed from South Belfast, this killing was part of a wider expansion of the South Belfast Brigade which by the early 1990s had expanded into Mid-[[Ulster]], where a brigade had existed on and off but had become moribund. South Belfast Brigade teams were based in South [[County Town|Down]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Lurgan]] and on the border at [[County Fermanagh]], as well as Cookstown.<ref name=\"McD187\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 187</ref> With these teams, Upper Ormeau, Lisburn and a combined Sandy Row/Village unit all active, the brigade was rivalled only by West Belfast in terms of ruthlessness in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"McD187\"/> The Village unit carried out the killing of a Catholic taxi driver, John O'Hara, on 17 April 1991, as part of a new UDA-wide policy of ringing known Catholic taxi firms to book a taxi and then shooting the driver when they arrived.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 188-189</ref> A notorious Lisburn hitman, known by the codename \"Gravedigger\", was also active on 25 May 1991 conducted a high-profile killing when he led a team that gunned down Sinn F\u00e9in councillor [[Eddie Fullerton]] at his home in [[County Donegal]].<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 192-193</ref> The policy of attacking Sinn F\u00e9in politicians had been developed by Ray Smallwoods, who had been released from prison and taken on a prominent role in both the [[Ulster Democratic Party]] (UDP) and the UDA, and it was followed soon after by the killing of Sinn F\u00e9in Councillor Bernard O'Hagan in [[Magherafelt]] by the Lisburn unit.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 205</ref> The Lisburn unit expanded significantly in 1991-2, launching a recruitment drive amongst teenagers in schools within its area. It carried out two more killings in early 1992.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 221-222</ref>\n\nIn February 1992 the brigade carried out the [[Sean Graham bookmakers' shooting]] in which five Catholic civilians were killed in a gun attack on the Ormeau Road.<ref>Taylor, p. 218</ref> Other killings that the group carried out included that of Michael Gilbride, a Catholic taxi driver who had settled in the Lower Ormeau area but who was killed outside his parents' home on Fernwood Street, not far from Bratty's Annadale Flats base.<ref>McDonald and Cusack, p. 238</ref><ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1992.html Sutton Index of Deaths 1992], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 23 November 2015.</ref> Donna Wilson, a Protestant and resident of Annadale Flats who had recently moved to the area from Tullycarnet in [[Dundonald, County Down|Dundonald]] was killed after residents had complained to Bratty in his role as local UDA commander about the noise of her stereo. Bratty assembled a team of ten men armed with baseball bats who broke in, beat her to death, seriously injuring three of her companions and wrecked the flat. In the end only a sixty-year-old who had led the complaints to Bratty was charged with relation to Wilson's death.<ref>McDonald and Cusack, pp. 238-239</ref> Bratty was also identified as the [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] for the attack in which Teresa Clinton, the wife of a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] election candidate, was murdered in her lower Ormeau home.<ref name=\"McD255\">McDonald and Cusack, p. 255</ref> Thomas Annett was not present at the Clinton killing but was killed in 1996 on 12 July when he got into a row with fellow UDA members outside an Ormeau Road bar and ended up being kicked to death.<ref>[http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2007/apr13_guilty_plea_loyalists_double_life_kept_secret.php Guilty plea meant loyalist's double life remained secret], ''[[The Irish News]]'', 15 April 2007</ref><ref name=\"McD255\"/> Bratty and Elder were ultimately killed by the IRA on 31 July 1994, shortly before its declaration of a ceasefire.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 269</ref>  McFerran, who was later revealed to have been an [[RUC Special Branch]] agent, was one of those who participated in the killing of Annett.<ref name=\"mccaffrey\">Barry McCaffrey.

The two then pooled their resources in a new dissident group, the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF).<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 284</ref>\n\nJackie McDonald was again appointed brigadier, having been released from prison. McDonald faced an early challenge as relations with the local [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) deteriorated and threatened to break out into a [[loyalist feud]]. [[Robert Bates (loyalist)|Robert \"Basher\" Bates]] had been a member of the notorious [[Shankill Butchers]] and one of his killings had been that of UDA member James Curtis Moorhead, with whom he had got into an argument in a Shankill bar in 1977. Having become a [[born-again Christian]], Bates was released from prison and took a job at the Ex-Prisoners Interpretative Centre on the Woodvale Road. Whilst outside the centre on 11 June 1997 a relative of Moorhead, who was himself a UDA member, approached Bates and shot him dead.<ref name=\"McD290\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 290</ref> Well-known locally, the killer was quickly identified and the UVF demanded he be given into their custody. However, following a meeting of the UDA's governing Inner Council (which McDonald, as South Belfast brigadier, attended) it was decided that the killer, who was highly regarded in the UDA, would be expelled from the Shankill and transferred to Taughmonagh as a member of the South Belfast Brigade.<ref name=\"McD290\"/> An attempt to kill him outside a bar on Sandy Row followed, leading to sour relations between the Sandy Row UDA and the Donegall Pass UVF.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 291</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a leading member of the Dunmurry UDA, Brian Morton, described in some contemporary reports as being the brigade's second-in-command, was killed when a [[pipe bomb]] he was making exploded prematurely.<ref>Wood, p. 201</ref> As part of a series of tit-for-tat killings in 1998, two members of the brigade, Jim Guiney and Robert Dougan, were killed by republicans.

Whilst supporting the [[Orange Order]]'s desire to march through [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] areas, McDonald was a lot less enthusiastic than Adair about getting involved in the [[Drumcree conflict]]. McDonald felt that mainstream [[Ulster unionism|unionist]] parties were playing too much of a role in Drumcree and publicly condemned their tendency to link up with loyalist paramilitaries when it suited them only to later drop them when their usefulness had expired.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 319</ref> Similarly he was unconvinced by a series of vandalism attacks on loyalist areas in Belfast in late June by three carloads of \"republicans\", feeling that the missile-throwing youths were actually members of Adair's C Company sent to stir up sectarian hatred and win support for Adair's Drumcree strategy.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 319-320</ref>\n\nMcDonald was one of a number of brigadiers to accept Adair's invitation to a \"Loyalist Day of Culture\" on the [[Shankill Road]] on 19 August 2000 but was shocked to find that C Company had used the day to drive UVF members and their families from the road, even attacking the homes of such UVF \"elder statesmen\" as [[Gusty Spence]] and [[Winston Churchill Rea]]. At the culmination of the day, McDonald and other brigadiers, as well as Deputy [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]] [[Frank McCoubrey]], were brought onto a makeshift stage where C Company members emerged and fired machine guns into the air in a show of strength.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 326-327</ref> McDonald had no desire to feud with the UVF and told his men to leave the Shankill that evening.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 330</ref> He promptly contacted his opposite number in the South Belfast UVF and concluded a pact that their members would not attack each other.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 336</ref>\n\nEven when the initial feud cooled, the enmity between McDonald and Adair continued to simmer and in Inner Council meetings the two frequently clashed as, according to one veteran loyalist, \"Jackie was the only one with the balls to stand up to him\".<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 370</ref> Nonetheless, when Adair was released from prison on 15 May 2002, McDonald, arguing that he deserved a second chance and hoping that his return to prison may have mellowed him, was one of the brigadiers to appear at Adair's Boundary Way home and welcome him back in front of the television cameras.<ref>Lister & Jordan, ''Mad Dog'', p. 303</ref>\n\nThe public display of amity between McDonald and Adair did not result in improved relations as time passed. On 14 September 2002, East Belfast LVF man Stephen Warnock was killed by the [[Red Hand Commando]] and immediately afterwards Adair, seeing an opportunity to strike back at a rival, went to his family home to inform visiting LVF members that the killing had been actually ordered by Jim Gray. With Adair's encouragement, an LVF hit team waited for Gray to appear at Warnock's house where, after he paid his respects to the family, he was shot in the face as he left. Gray was seriously injured but survived the attack.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 371-372</ref>\n\nMcDonald called a crisis meeting of brigadiers, including Adair, at [[Sandy Row]] but it failed to reach a conclusion as Adair denied involvement in the attack on Gray.<ref name=\"UDA374\"/> As soon as the meeting was over, Adair drove to Ballysillan in north Belfast to meet with allies in the LVF, although he was unaware that a mainstream UDA team were following him and recording his movements.<ref>Lister & Jordan, ''Mad Dog'', pp. 318-319</ref> When McDonald was told about this second meeting he secured agreement with the other brigadiers that Adair should be expelled from the UDA.<ref name=\"UDA374\">McDonald & Cusack, p. 374</ref> Tension simmered for the next few months with little real fighting although McDonald threw a ring of steel around his Taughmonagh stronghold and even obtained an [[air raid siren]] to be sounded if any C Company members attempted to enter the estate.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, p. 375</ref>\n\nThe killing of John Gregg and his associate Rab Carson by C Company in [[Sailortown, Belfast|Sailortown]] on 1 February 2003 finally led to a showdown, with McDonald taking charge of the anti-Adair faction. McDonald quickly got word to A and B Company of the [[UDA West Belfast Brigade|West Belfast UDA]], covering the Highfield estate and Woodvale areas of the [[Greater Shankill]] and nominally under Adair's command, that Adair was to be removed and secured the loyalty of these two groups. He also told them to set up an office on the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club as a safe house where members of C Company could defect back to the mainstream UDA.<ref>McDonald & Cusack, pp. 383-384</ref>\n\nAt around 1{{small|am}} on 6 February 2003, about 100 heavily armed UDA members invaded the lower Shankill and set upon the twenty or so members of C Company who had remained loyal to Adair.
