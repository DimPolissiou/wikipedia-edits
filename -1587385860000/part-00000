However, like other similar diamond retailers, Tiffany's enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores. In 1978, a female customer in New York City was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from Tiffany two years earlier for $100,000. Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' publication in 1982, [[Edward Jay Epstein]] explained the rationale for such a policy:\n\n<blockquote>\nRetail jewelers, especially the prestigious Fifth Avenue stores, prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers, because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low ... Most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value. Moreover, since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment, and need not pay for them until they are sold, they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers. Rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds, retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds \"retail.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond?|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/?single_page=true|accessdate= 15 July 2013|newspaper= The Atlantic|date= 1 February 1982|author= Edward Jay Epstein}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Colored gemstones===\nTiffany offers jewelry incorporating a wide variety of colored gemstones including gems it played a role in popularizing such as [[tsavorite]],<ref name=\"ICA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/tsavorite.html |title=Tsavorite Garnet |publisher=Gemstone.org |accessdate=2015-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610182036/http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/tsavorite.html |archivedate=2008-06-10 }}</ref> [[Spodumene#Kunzite|Kunzite]], and [[morganite]].

However, like other similar diamond retailers, Tiffany's enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing of diamonds sold from its stores. In 1978, a female customer in New York City was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had bought from Tiffany two years earlier for $100,000. Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' publication in 1982, [[Edward Jay Epstein]] explained the rationale for such a policy:\n\n<blockquote>\nRetail jewelers, especially the prestigious Fifth Avenue stores, prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers, because the offer they would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low ... Most jewelers would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value. Moreover, since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement rings from wholesalers on consignment, and need not pay for them until they are sold, they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds from customers. Rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid for diamonds, retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients firms that specialize in buying diamonds \"retail.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond?|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/?single_page=true|accessdate= 15 July 2013|newspaper= The Atlantic|date= 1 February 1982|author= Edward Jay Epstein}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Colored gemstones===\nTiffany offers jewelry incorporating a wide variety of colored gemstones including gems it played a role in popularizing such as [[tsavorite]],<ref name=\"ICA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/tsavorite.html |title=Tsavorite Garnet |publisher=Gemstone.org |accessdate=2015-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610182036/http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/tsavorite.html |archivedate=2008-06-10 }}</ref> [[Spodumene#Kunzite|Kunzite]], and [[morganite]].

The total number of homeless people in the United States is unknown, since counts from independent shelter providers and statistics managed by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] vary greatly. While federal HUD counts hover annually at around 500,000 people, independent shelter providers estimate at least 4,000,000 people are homeless in the United States. Point-in-time counts are also not precise measures of homeless populations.\n\nHomeless people may use shelters, or may sleep in cars, tents, on couches, or in other public places. Separate counts of sheltered people and unsheltered people are critical in understanding the homeless population.\n\nEach state has different laws, social services and medical policies, and other conditions which influence the number of homeless persons, and what services are available to homeless people in each state.\n\nThe state by state counts of people listed below are derived from under-reported federal HUD statistics.\n\n==Alaska==\nMental illness in Alaska is a current epidemic that the state struggles to maintain.

Aggressive measures have been taken in order to address this issue. The state of Arizona has been very active in attempting to criminalize acts of panhandling. Measures have included arresting and jailing individuals caught in the act. Arizona's Revised Statutes title 13. Criminal Code 2905(a)(3) sought to ban begging from the state of Arizona, specifically in the area of being \"present in a public place to beg, unless specifically authorized by law.\"<ref name=\"American Civil Liberties Union\">{{cite web|title=Arizona's Anti-Begging Law declared Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclu.org/news/arizonas-anti-begging-law-declared-unconstitutional|website=American Civil Liberties Union|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The city of Flagstaff took the policy a step further by implementing a practice of arresting, jailing and prosecuting individuals who are beg for money or food.<ref name=\"American Civil Liberties Union\"/> In February 2013, Marlene Baldwin, a woman in her late 70s was arrested and jailed for asking a plain clothed officer for $1.25.

In his judgement, Judge Neil V. Wake declared the A.R.S 13-2905(a)(3) was void and prohibited any practices the city of Flagstaff has implemented that \" interferes with, targets, cites, arrests, or prosecutes any person on the basis of their act(s) of peaceful begging in public areas.\"<ref name=\"American Civil Liberties Union\"/>\nDespite this, the state of Arizona continued to pursue other ways to criminalize panhandling. Their response to Judge Wake's judgment was to criminalize \"aggressive panhandling.

The proposed laws would make it a civil traffic offence for an individual to be at a median strip for any purposes other than crossing the road.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\">{{cite web|last1=Coppola|first1=Chris|title=Chandler Targets roadside panhandling|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler/2015/10/21/chandler-targets-roadside-panhandling/74234224/|website=The Arizona Repubilic|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Under the proposed law, the first violation would be treated as a civil traffic offence; however, a second violation within 24 months would be treated as a Class 1 misdemeanor citation in which an individual could be fined a maximum of $2500 and face up to six months in jail.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\"/>\nThe State of Arizona continues to seek measures that would both limit panhandling but also satisfy the judgement made by Judge Neil V.

For example, two homeless men reported separate incidents of having been kicked out of Little Rock Bus Station by police officers. Despite showing valid tickets that showed that their bus would arrive within 30 minutes, they were told they could not wait on the premises because they were loitering. In another incident, police officers told homeless people to leave a free public event or be subject to arrest for loitering in a park, although vendors at the event had encouraged the homeless to attend and take free samples of their merchandise. In 2005, police assembled an undercover taskforce to crack down on panhandling in the downtown Little Rock area, arresting 41 people.<ref name=\"Homeless 2016\"/> 72% of the homeless report ever being arrested.<ref name=\"media.arkansasonline.com\"/>\n\n==California (by major counties){{anchor|California (by major counties)}}==\n[[File:Tent city (E. 12th St.).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[tent city]] at Oakland California (E. 12th Street) set up by local homeless people.]]\n[[File:Homeless man at West Shaw Ave. (Fresno CA 93722).jpg|thumb|upright|Homeless man in Fresno, California.]]\nCalifornia in 2017 had an oversized share of the nation's homeless: 22%, for a state whose residents make up only 12% of the country's total population.

The state of California has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the United States. As agricultural migrations have occurred and with urbanization spreading, empirical research and data analysis will be pivotal in understanding the major causes of homelessness. In order to determine solutions to mitigate and minimize homelessness, sociologist, non-governmental agencies (NGO\u2019s), and federal and state government agencies will need to work collectively to collaborate on curbing homelessness, not only in the state of California but throughout the entire United States. Current research has proven that people entering homelessness after the age of fifty, become homeless for environmental purposes rather than mental illness and substance abuse. \nAs the baby boomer generation retires and housing costs and financial crisis become more rampant and prevalent, understanding the difference between environmental causes versus traditional causes such as mental illness and drug addiction will be necessary. According to Individuals who first became homeless before age 50 had a higher prevalence of recent mental health and substance use problems and more difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (p.&nbsp;1)\u201d. Thus, education and compassion training will be extremely important, especially for Gen X and Gen Y, in order to understand reasonings behind homelessness and creating solutions.  In addition, housing programs and civic engagement will be extremely important and necessary as well.<ref>Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016).

Homelessness is a growing problem in the State of Colorado and is considered the most important social determinants of health (State of Colorado). Every individual deserves to live in good conditions and have their own home based on rights for housing. Some people do not realize that homelessness is very difficult for many individuals to escape with the continuous increase in costs for housing in Colorado along with mental health treatments and other factors. When people are forced to live without stable shelter they are then exposed to a number of risk factors that affect physical and mental health (State of Colorado). Although it is difficult to pin point any one cause of homelessness, there is a complicated combination of societal and individual causes. With the hard work of community organizations along with some helpful state initiatives, one would believe that homelessness can be escaped and even prevented.\n\nWhile he was Mayor of [[Denver, Colorado]], Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first \"State of the City\" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during the cold winters. In 2006, officials said that this number had risen over the past few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Homelessness/default.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512010632/http://www.denvergov.org/homelessness/Default.asp|url-status=dead|title=Redirect<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSome findings of the factors contributing to homelessness involve many issues. Among them was factual data about the number of residents that have moved to Colorado since 2011, totaling nearly 650 thousand.<ref>(United States Census Bureau, n.d)</ref> This influx of residents has caused a shortage in affordable housing and contributed to the price of homeownership and renting to increase yearly. The costs have become so expensive that a person has to make nearly four times the states minimum wage to afford a medium-priced rental. This model is unsustainable per the <ref>United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, [USICH], (2014)</ref> which describes rent as being considered affordable if it is less than thirty percent of total monthly income.  Another factor, is the perception that most people are homeless due to their own actions. While this may be true for a rare few, the majority are reluctant to seek services that could help better their situation due to fear of discrimination. Research conducted by,<ref>Johnston, Jetten, Dingle, Parsell and Walter (2016)</ref> shows that the homeless population are perceived as less than human and are not worthy of support or assistance, often they face contempt and prejudice amongst fellow homeless and the community. This is contributing to the perpetuation of chronic homelessness as people are too afraid to seek assistance and support. A third factor identified, is in how the cities are handling this demographic. There have been 350 \"anti-homeless\u201d ordinances enacted, which criminalize daily survival necessities of the homeless, but criminalizing these behaviors fails to mitigate the root causes, and maintains conditions that keep people homeless.<ref>(Ruan, 2018)</ref> While the cities have enacted these ordinances to combat hazards associated with the homeless such as fires, trash, crime and tent cities, it creates a revolving door of street to jail, jail to street.\n\nResearch has also indicated a vast shortage in shelter capabilities and resources. The number of homeless people, which in 2018 was nearly eleven thousand, consisted of families, veterans and chronically homeless.<ref>(USICH, n.d)</ref> According to,<ref>Ruan (2018)</ref> Denver, the state's capitol, can shelter less than ten percent of its homeless population, and other cities advertise their lack of shelters and resources in an effort to deter people from going to those cities. This means that people are forced to seek shelter wherever available and is usually in violation of one of the city ordinances, like the no camping ban. During the winter months shelters are on a first come, first serve basis, and people are often waiting for hours in the cold for the doors to open. This is especially challenging for those trying to work because if they are not in line at a certain time, they will likely not get shelter that evening. There are simply not enough shelters or resources to handle the entire homeless demographic, and too many limitations on getting into a shelter for the evening. This creates another burden on resources, accountable care organizations (ACO\u2019s) conducted research and found that housing needs had to be addressed before a person could effectively engage in medical treatment, and by addressing this issue first, medical cost were reduced by 53%.<ref>(Fraze, Lewis, Rodriguez and Fisher, 2016)</ref> Therefore, addressing housing needs can reduce medical treatment and further strain on resources. The research conducted has given great insight into the immense challenges the state and its homeless residents face. There are numerous factors contributing to homelessness, both individually and partially because of the cities themselves. The lack of shelters and strain on resources, contributes to the limited progress of addressing this issue. In order to make a significant impact, the state can adopt multiple new methods that were proven effective in other places to help curb the demographic much faster\n\nIn April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dezzutti|first1=Dominic|title=The True Motivation behind the Denver Camping Ban|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/04/01/the-true-motivation-behind-the-denver-camping-ban/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=April 2012}}</ref> Denver enacted the Urban Camping Ban due to the occupy Denver protest and the number of homeless on the 16th Street Mall. The ordinance was developed because businesses and individuals in Denver complained to the Mayor's office and City Council that the number of people who were sleeping in front of their business doorways and this was disruptive and made it uncomfortable for individuals to enter their businesses. In addition, Occupy Denver had taken over public space near the capital building in Denver and it became a homeless compound consisting of tents and other structures. The pressure to clean up Denver by businesses and other individuals on the Councilman Albus Brooks sponsored the legislation. Mayor Michael Hancock and City Council passed the urban camping ban which prohibited individuals from sleeping in public places with a blanket over them or something between them and the ground. Those who enact these laws often state it is the tool needed to encourage those who are not accessing services to find ways to address the issues that caused them to be homeless. The Civil Liberties Union wrote a strong letter in opposition to the Denver ordinance.\n\nThe number of homeless peoples increased from 2016 to 2017 by 1,121 <ref>Henry, M., Watt, R., Rosenthal, L., Shivji, A., & Associates A.

There is a shortage in Denver of mental health services for homeless people. The most common mental health issues among the homeless include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<ref>Jervis, R. (2014, August 28). Mental Disorders Keep Thousands of Homeless On Streets. , from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless-series/14255283/</ref> Therapy sessions, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and prescription drugs are the most common mental health treatment options for the public. However, the homeless are unable to afford them. There are organizations who strive to help the homeless by providing food, shelter, and clothes, but there are currently not many organizations focused only on improving the mental health in the homeless community of Denver. Housing the homeless has been proven to help reduce homelessness, but that does not solve the mental health issue that a lot of homeless people possess. If organizations adopt a new program to house the homeless, get them counseling, and then help them get a job and food on the table, this will enhance their quality of life and their recovery process. Thee effects of mental health and the number of homeless people with mental health issues would be drastically diminished through programs of this nature. Organizations currently use government funding, grants from private companies, and donations. New and more dynamic services for the homeless affected by mental health could be paid for in the same way. Those that oppose more dynamic mental health services for the homeless often rely on their own opinions rather than on facts such as \"the more help the homeless get, the more likely they are to get back on their feet and succeed\".<ref>Webster, P. (2017, December 9). Treatment and Recovery Are Not Optional in Solving Homelessness. from http://solutionsforchange.org/treatment-recovery-not-optional-solving-homelessness/</ref>\n\nThe homeless population over the last four years within the state of Colorado has remained fairly constant.  However, this does not mean that this is not an issue that needs to be addressed.  This is because while the overall population has remained stagnant the number of people who are choosing to be unsheltered is actually increasing steadily.  Why the homeless population total has remained constant within the midst of such a drastic economic boom can be seen within the data taken during the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time (PIT) Count.  According to HUD's PIT Count (2018)<ref>HUD 2018 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs Homeless Populations and Subpopulations. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/reportmanagement/published/CoC_PopSub_State_CO_2018.pdf.</ref> there are 10,857 people who are currently homeless within the state of Colorado.  This report also breaks down several aspects of the homeless population to include the biggest demographics that are currently homeless.  The biggest portion of homeless people can be categorized as those with mental illnesses.  These 2,171 people make up roughly 20 percent of the total population.  According to Bharadwaj, Pai, and Suziedelyte (2017)<ref>Bharadwaj, P., Pai, M., & Suziedelyte, A. (2017). Mental Health Stigma. Economics Letters, 159, 57-60. doi: 10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.028.</ref> people are less likely to report that they have a mental health issue when compared to other medical conditions that may be ailing them.  This stigma and fear of reporting is leading to many people deciding not to try and fight there disease on their own rather than seeking help.  Unfortunately this can lead to many of them becoming homeless or even worse suicide.  The second highest portion comes from those who are considered to be chronic substance abusers.  This population (1,999 people) make up approximately 18 percent.  The third highest demographic is Veterans who make up almost 10 percent of the total population or 1,073 people.  While the leading causes can be seen there is still a matter of how to handle this issue in order to reduce the number of people living on the street.  The best way to do this is to follow in Denver's footsteps and start a statewide outreach program that provides aid to the homeless population.  Currently Denver does this through and outreach court that is ran by the Denver Rescue Mission in which they help enroll them in Medicaid programs or help them get mental health assistance if they need it.  This program is currently ran every other Wednesday and since this is where the biggest portion of homeless people reside it would be beneficial for the state's program to run on the opposite Wednesdays.  The community also needs to buy into helping with this issue by getting drug and alcohol counselors, rehabilitation centers, and the VA Hospital engaged with helping the population during these outreach days.  The community must ban together in order to take care of the homeless population and get more people off of the streets and into a home.\n\n'''Organizational Contribution and Youth Homelessness'''\n\nThe Colorado Coalition for the Homeless has been around since 1984 and claims to have turned around tens of thousands of homeless people in Colorado. The Stout Street Health Center provided 114,706 care visits and helped 778 U.S. veterans with various health services and housing, as of 2018 (Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, n.d.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloradocoalition.org/|title=Colorado Coalition for the Homeless|website=www.coloradocoalition.org|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> Other organizations, such as Urban Peak Colorado Springs (UPCS), are helping to support homeless youth in the area by providing clean clothes, connections to shelters, or even housing in the area (n.d.).<ref name=\"About Urban Peak Colorado Springs\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanpeak.org/colorado-springs/about-us/about-urban-peak/about-urban-peak-colorado-springs/|title=About Urban Peak Colorado Springs|website=Urban Peak|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> Regardless of how positive the organizations are with services and how many people have gone through successfully, more help is needed.

They could be in that situation because of socio-economic issues, disability, loss of income due to natural disasters, discrimination due to being a minority group, lack of education, health issues and many more. Consequently, the approach to these social issues must be responsive to people's needs to help them escape poverty and the need to beg.\n\nThe state of Florida deals with panhandling and begging in a variety of ways, like the rest of the United States.

For example, their first major initiative was to criminalize homelessness. They saw the homeless population as a threat to public safety. However, their efforts were met with conflicted responses from police and Georgian citizens due to the large size and demographic makeup of the homeless population in Atlanta. Majority of this group's makeup were black males. On top of that, Atlanta's first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], had been recently elected into office. Having successfully elected a black male into office, the topic of race and politics was prominent in the minds of many Georgian citizens.<ref name=\":04\" /> The idea to criminalize homelessness looked bad in the eyes of these citizens and created a lot of skepticism about the CAP's true purpose.

Prohibitions, including loitering and sleeping outdoors, have expanded to include strict panhandling restraints. These do not necessarily include complete bans, but can cover when, where and how panhandling can be legally conducted. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]], gives that this is a result of gentrification coupled with Hawaii's dependence on tourism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Loew|first1=Tracy|title=Panhandling laws spreading|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jan/24/ln/hawaii801240357.html|accessdate=December 18, 2016|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2013 alone, tourism in Hawaii generated $14.5 billion, which averaged $39 million per day.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hawaii Tourism Authority|title=Hawaii Tourism Facts |url=http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/9_1%20HTA%20Factsheet%20as%20of%20May%201%202014%20Final.pdf|website=Hawaii Tourism Authority|publisher=State of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> This major sector is therefore a vital consideration in panhandling legislation.\n\nHawaiian locals and business operators such as Dave Moskowitz agree with these restraints, arguing that panhandling is bad for tourism.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nPolice, on the other hand, give that panhandling is not a prominent issue, nor is it prioritized.<ref name=Scott2002>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Michael S.|title=Panhandling|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)|issue=13|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222002932/https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|archive-date=December 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Legally, ethically and practically, it is difficult for police to enforce strict panhandling laws at all times, thus police discretion plays a vital role in determining who is cited and how many citations are given.\n\nFor the panhandling population who are cited, there is a general feeling of indifference, perhaps even disregard. Ralph McCarroll, for example, says that he has 30 citations and that law enforcement knows that he is never going to pay them.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> A number of studies indicate that the average panhandler is an unmarried, unemployed male in his 30s to 40s, often with drug/alcohol problems, a lack of social support and laborer's skills.<ref name=Scott2002 /> These factors are likely to affect the poor perception of these laws in the panhandling population.\n\nSocial justice advocates and non-governmental organizations will argue that this approach is therefore counter-intuitive. They argue that panhandling laws violate free speech, criminalize homelessness and remove an essential part of destitute people's lives. Doran Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, argues that these laws merely deal with the symptoms of homelessness rather than fixing the problem.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nThe role of the court is essential in clarifying whether the laws are constitutionally valid. In 2015, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Hawaii foundation (ACLUH) paired with Davis Levin Livingston Law Firm to represent Justin Guy in suit against the Hawaii County. Guy's lawyers argued that prohibiting their client from holding up a sign that read 'Homeless Please Help' offended his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.<ref name=ACLU2016>{{cite web|author1=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|title=Settlement in Hawaii County|url=https://acluhi.org/2015/09/14/settlement-in-hawaii-county-free-speech-case/|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Matthew Winter, a lawyer on the case, made reference to political candidates (who are lawfully able to hold signs), to contrast against the inability of the poor to hold up signs asking for help.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> The court ruled in Guy's favour, which led to an award of $80,000 compensation and repeal of subsections 14-74, 14-75, 15-9, 15-20, 15-21, 15-35 and 15-37 of the Hawaii County Code. In a statement, Guy emphasized the need for the State of Hawaii to treat the homeless with the same dignity as the general population.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> This court ruling is a positive step in that direction.\n\nThe future of panhandling laws in Hawaii is reliant on legislators and their perception of panhandling's impact on tourism. By utilizing aggressive political language, such as 'the war on homelessness' and 'emergency state,' Hawaiian politics will continue to criminalize the behaviours of destitute populations. On the other hand, with pressure from state/federal departments and non-governmental organizations, restrictions on panhandling laws may be possible. The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]], for example, has stated that it would not provide homeless assistance funds to states that criminalize homelessness.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> Given that Hawaii has one of the USA's largest growing homeless populations (between 2007 and 2016, Hawaii saw a 30.5% increase in homelessness), it is in a poor position to reject federal funding and assistance from non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite news|author1=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress |url=https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016 |agency=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|publisher=United States Federal Government|date=November 2016}}</ref> Due to these factors, recent court disapproval, repeals and police discretion, it is likely that over time strict panhandling laws in Hawaii will lessen in severity.\n\n==Illinois==\nOver the years, the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and [[New York City]], although no statistical data have backed this up.

There has also been widespread concern about the legitimacy of panhandlers and the significant amount of money that some are making. Cedar Rapids panhandler, Dawn, admitted that she has come across many illegitimate panhandlers. These include people who already have access to housing and financial assistance, and even some who pretend to be disabled or to be a veteran.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Brady|title=Possible ban on aggressive panhandling, panhandling at controlled intersections, on horizon in Cedar Rapids|url=http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Possible-ban-on-aggressive-panhandling-panhandling-at-controlled-intersections-on-horizon-in-Cedar-Rapids-380904721.html|accessdate=December 16, 2016|agency=KCRG-TV9|date=May 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA famous incident in Muscatine, Iowa, photos of which went viral, provides a prime example of the tensions that exist around the legitimacy of panhandlers.

The ordinance also includes plans for police to be able to give resource cards to panhandlers. These cards provide a list of resources which provide housing, food and financial assistance.\n\nCouncils claim that these ordinances are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent traffic accidents. Other rationales behind these laws include 'to improve the image of the city to tourists, businesses and other potential investors' and to reflect the growing \"compassion fatigue\" of the city's middle and upper class after increasingly being exposed to widespread homelessness.<ref name=\"Nowhere to go: The impacts of city ordinances criminalizing homelessness\">{{cite journal|last1=Saelinger|first1=Donald|title=Nowhere to go: The impacts of city ordinances criminalizing homelessness|journal=Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law & Policy|date=2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=545\u2013566|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojpovlp13&div=31&id=&page=}}</ref> However, Saelinger (2006) argues that these laws '\"criminalize\" the very condition of being homeless'.<ref name=\"Nowhere to go: The impacts of city ordinances criminalizing homelessness\"/> Saelinger (2006) also claims that through the implementation of these laws, governments have focused on making homelessness invisible, rather than working to eradicate it.<ref name=\"Nowhere to go: The impacts of city ordinances criminalizing homelessness\"/> The aesthetics of cities has also influenced the enactment of these ordinances, with businesses complaining that panhandlers bother their customers and make them feel uncomfortable, in addition to ruining the image of the city.<ref name=\"thegazette.com\"/>\n\n==Kansas==\nIn comparison with the US, Kansas continued to have an increasing level of homelessness until 2015.

This increase in 'untruthful' begging has resulted in further chronic homelessness, as those who are most genuinely in need are being sidelined by 'quick-fix intruders'.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe consequences of begging and panhandling across Kansas is not uniform, it differs from county to county, with some counties choosing to acknowledge it as a crime and others rejecting its presence. Under Kansas' Wyandotte County code of ordinances, panhandling is deemed an unlawful act when it occurs in an aggressive manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.municode.com/library/ks/wyandotte_county_-_unified_government/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CH22MIPROF_ARTIVOFAGPUPE_S22-127PA|title=Municode Library|website=Municode.com |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The consequences of panhandling present as an unclassified misdemeanour, which under Wyandotte County law signifies that unless the penalty is otherwise stated, it will receive the same penalty as a Class C misdemeanour i.e., punishable by up to one month in jail and a fine of up to $500.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/kansas-misdemeanor-crimes-class-and-sentences.htm#|title=Kansas Misdemeanor Crimes by Class and Sentences {{!}} Criminal Law|newspaper=CriminalDefenseLawyer.com |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> This is less severe in comparison to Wichita County whereby the act of begging is deemed as a crime of loitering and is penalized with a fine of up to $1,000, one year imprisonment, or both.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.municode.com/library/ks/wichita/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT5PUSAMO_CH5.48LO_S5.48.040BEETIODELO|title=Municode Library|website=Municode.com |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Counties such as Topeka County and Sedgwick however differ, with Sedgwick County making no mention of such acts constituting crimes within its ordinance, Topeka follows suit.

In Battle Creek, officials passed a pair of proposals that are aimed at limiting panhandling and loitering throughout the city.<ref name=\"battlecreekenquirer.com\">{{cite news|last1=Bowman|first1=J|title=It's official: City passes panhandling, loitering laws|url=http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/local/2016/09/06/battle-creek-passes-panhandling-loitering-ordinances/89905218/|agency=Battle Creek Enquirer|date=September 6, 2016}}</ref> City commissioners were split in the vote along with the general public. Under the new ordinances the following situations could lead to legal apprehension by the police - remaining idly within 25 feet of an intersection without a license; soliciting money from anyone near building entrances, restrooms, ATMS or in line; panhandling between sunset and sunrise on public property without an official license or permit; approaching another person in a way that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, intimidated or harassed; forcing oneself upon another i.e. continuing to ask for money after being turned down. Any violations can be considered civil infractions and can result in fines. The bill, aimed at targeting 'aggressive' panhandling was passed in September 2016.<ref name=\"battlecreekenquirer.com\"/>\n\nThere are a range of implications that come along with the criminalization of begging behaviours. Jessica Vail is the program manager of the Grand Rapids Area Collation to End Homelessness and contends that it is more cost efficient for people to not be homeless and it also keeps our criminal justice system from getting overloaded.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hillen|first1=T|title=Report: Homelessness up in Michigan|url=http://woodtv.com/2015/05/01/report-homelessness-up-in-michigan/|agency=Wood TV (Grand Rapids)|date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> Don Mitchell conducted research in 1998 on the criminalization of behaviours associated with homelessness and begging and highlighted the negative effect this has on the cycle of homelessness and crime.

For example, in Stevens County, administrators of social service programs unanimously agreed that rural poverty is distinguishable by location and panhandlers have a low presence in [[Stevens County, Minnesota|Stevens County]], while a high frequency in the city of [[Minneapolis]] situated in [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.morris.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=cst |title=Towards a Better Understanding of Rural Homelessness: An Examination of Housing Crisis in a Small, Rural Minnesota Community |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a statewide study conducted by the Wilder Foundation on [[Homelessness]] indicated the presence of 10,214 homeless in Minnesota. The one-day count was conducted by 1,200 volunteers around 400 locations known to attract homeless such as transitional housing, shelters, drop in sites, hot meal programs and church basements. An increase of six percent in homeless were observed since the last study in 2009, while 55% of the homeless population were females and over 46% were under the age of 21.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sophia.stkate.edu/scuvoh_home/|title=Guide to Collection |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a study conducted by St Stephen's Street Outreach staff, 55 panhandlers were surveyed in downtown Minneapolis to determine why people beg and how local police treat panhandlers. Individual responses neither collectively favoured negative or positive responses for the interaction between police and panhandlers. Examples of responses include that the police 'give you trouble', tell them to 'get the hell out of here' and 'give you a ticket', while other individuals believed that police were 'usually understanding', 'gentle' and 'very friendly and helpful'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ststephensmpls.org/sites/default/files/why-i-beg.pdf|title=Why I Beg|last=|first=|date=|website=Ststephensmpls.org|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Minneapolis' anti-begging law was overturned due to its breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the right to free speech. As a result of this response, the city council of Minneapolis collectively agreed to implement a modified version of the anti begging law. Although panhandlers are protected by the First Amendment, those who aggressively solicit and/or in prohibited locations are in the act of violating the Minneapolis City Ordinance 385.60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbrooklyncenter.org/index.aspx?NID=1074|title=Brooklyn Center, MN - Official Website - Panhandlers|website=Cityofbrooklyncenter.org |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> This regulation is violated when an individual offers a service of low value for a donation or verbally requests for an object or money in locations such as the entry way of a government building, near a parked vehicle, near public transport, in or near a restroom, on a crosswalk, entertainment venues, petrol station, convenience store or near a financial establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legalbeagle.com/12010836-can-arrested-panhandling.html|title=Can You Get Arrested for Panhandling?|website=Legal Beagle |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The individual must also use either physical contact, threaten criminal activity upon property, block entrances, stalk, use abusive language, suggest body mutilation if not given money, beg in groups of more than one person, beg under the influence of drugs or alcohol and solicit in the night hours after sunset and before sunrise in those areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/police/report/police_crime-reporting_aggressivepanhandling|title=Aggressive Panhandling|website=Minneapolismn.gov |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The purpose of the Minneapolis city ordinance 385.60 is to protect the public for being hounded by panhandlers at certain locations. However, law in the state of Minnesota does not prohibit passive panhandling, such as holding a sign without verbal interaction and focuses on [[aggressive panhandling]] as a breach of the law. Other cities in Minnesota such as [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], [[Brooklyn Center, Minnesota|Brooklyn Center]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St Paul]] have similar versions of the ordinance and have all avoided judicial scrutiny on the grounds of protecting individual privacy against [[assault]] based behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/is-minneapolis-begging-law-doomed/363962261/|title=Is Minneapolis' begging law doomed?|newspaper=Star Tribune|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEfforts by the population of Minnesota to redirect the money given to panhandlers to organizations that aim to end homelessness have been implemented in the city of Minneapolis. An example of this is 'Give Real Change', a campaign that began in 2009 with the aim to end homelessness for 300 to 500 people in areas within Minneapolis by the end of 2025. Billboards implemented by the campaign that display 'Say NO To Panhandling and YES To Giving,' urge community members to stop giving money to beggars and alternatively donate it to an organization that allocates money to shelters to end homelessness. The executive director of St Stephens Human Services, Gail Dorfman is a supporter of the initiative and believes that it can act as a long term solution for homelessness.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/downtown-minneapolis-billboards-try-to-stop-begging-at-the-source/261764091/|title=Downtown Minneapolis billboards try to stop begging at the source|newspaper=Star Tribune|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mississippi==\nIt is estimated that there are at least 1,738 homeless people in the US state of Mississippi, according to the 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress prepared by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.<ref name=\":42\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf|title=The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress - Part 1|last=|first=|date=November 2016|website=HUD Exchange|publisher=US Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> This number is likely to be much greater as this survey only provides a snapshot of homelessness rates at the time of data collection in January 2016.

While in most US states such legislation is primarily enacted and included in city ordinances rather than state law, in Mississippi, the 2015 Mississippi Code provides for a specific definition of vagrancy that allows for \"able-bodied persons who go begging for a livelihood\" to be punished as vagrants as they are seen to be committing crimes against public peace and security.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2015/title-97/chapter-35/section-97-35-37/|title=MS Code \u00a7 97-35-37 (2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=JUSTIA US Law|access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref> In addition, Title 99, Chapter 29 of the Code mandates law enforcement officers to arrest known vagrants with those deemed 'vagrant' subjected to fines for a first offence and up to six months imprisonment and the payment of court costs for subsequent offences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2015/title-99/chapter-29/section-99-29-1/|title=MS Code \u00a7 99-29-1 (2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=JUSTIA US Law|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> These definitions and penalties for homelessness have remained largely unchanged historically in the state of Mississippi which has tended to define vagrants to include those living in idleness or without employment and having no means of support, prostitutes, gamblers as well as beggars.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lacey|first=Forrest|year=1952|title=Vagrancy and Other Crimes of Personal Conduct|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=66|issue=7|pages=1203\u20131226|doi=10.2307/1336937|jstor=1336937}}</ref> In fact, those who fall under these population groups continue to be defined as vagrants under the 2015 Mississippi Code.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2015/title-97/chapter-35/section-97-35-37/|title=MS Code \u00a7 97-35-37 (2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=JUSTIA US Law |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi's largest city, begging or panhandling is specifically prohibited under the definition of \"commercial solicitation\".

For subsequent offences, penalties may include up to 30 days community service, a $1,000 fine or up to 30 days imprisonment.<ref name=\":22\" /> However, passive solicitation is not unlawful. This means that simply holding a sign asking for money is not illegal and in fact, is protected by the Jackson city ordinance that prohibits panhandling.

For instance, Raymond was arrested at least 10 times in as little as one month in Jackson shortly after experiencing homelessness from the combined effects of relationship breakdown, financial stress and a deterioration in physical health. What Raymond and the ACLU call for are additional support services to assist homeless community members find employment, housing and other support services rather than a \"revolving door of crime\" and entry into the criminal justice system that is perpetuated through simplistic bans on panhandling and other associated acts of vagrancy.<ref name=\":32\" /> While the US Supreme Court has not decisively decided on this issue and there is considerable debate as to whether begging constitutes conduct or speech, Fraser (2010) suggests that begging is likely to constitute speech and therefore blanket bans on begging in public areas enacted by local governments as in the case of Mississippi cities such as Jackson and Gulfport are likely to be unconstitutional and in breach of the First Amendment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=John|year=2015|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg?

Through a demographic examination it becomes evident that New Mexico has a high proportion of ethnographies that are currently and historically socioeconomically disadvantaged.<ref>Norris, Tina; Vines, Paula L.; Hoeffel, Elizabeth M. (February 2012). \"The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010\" (PDF). Census 2010 Brief. United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 1, 2012.</ref> Native Americans as a proportion of the US population represent the second highest amongst all States with only Alaska  having a higher ratio, while it also has a large Hispanic population. Homelessness is a direct cause from an individual not being able to provide themselves with the most basic of necessities to maintain a healthy life hence having a higher proportion of individuals in poverty places a greater risk of an individual becoming homeless. A study into cost of homelessness on the state government of New Mexico concluded that, on a per nightly basis, emergency shelter costs $30; supportive housing $33, state penitentiary $77, Santa Fe County Detention Centre $82, St Vincent Hospital $550 and UNM Hospital $71.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Which study?  Cite the study.}}  Homelessness by and large is caused by or as a result of health care complications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=}} One need only  consider ailments such as addiction, psychological disorders, HIV/AIDS and an array of other ailments that require consistent long term care that cannot be well managed in an unsafe, unpredictable environment that confronts most homeless.\n\nInability to adequately manage these medical problems places a further economic burden on the state as the frequency and duration of hospital visits may increase. This phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that on average homeless spent four days longer than comparable non-homeless, costing the State approximately $2,414 per hospitalization. Homelessness causes both serious mental and physical anguish as evidenced by the fact that a homeless person's psychiatric hospitalization rate is 100 times more than their non-homeless compatriot.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this paragraph.}}\n\nDue to New Mexico's strong laws against loitering, sleeping in cars and begging (traits a lot of homeless people are forced to do) they are disproportionately over-represented in the prison system. Police officials can accuse any person they believe may have attempted to disrupt the peace, regardless of whether or not the offense presents danger to the community. Panhandling is an umbrella term that represents begging, sponging and spanging. In the state of New Mexico there are strict regulations on panhandling. Moreover, homeless people are prohibited to beg after dark and if they do they are often sent to jail. In an attempt to remove homeless people from the streets, it is common for the police to dispose of their property.  The above conditions cause the mere act of being homeless to become a self-perpetuating cycle of crime.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this entire paragraph.}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional \"right to shelter\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |title=NYC Department of Homeless Services |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* 27,844 adults\n* 20,627 children\n* 48,471 total individuals\n\nAccording to the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], the homeless population of New York rose to an all-time high in 2011. A reported 113,552 people slept in the city's emergency shelters last year, including over 40,000 children; marking an 8 percent increase from the previous year and a 37 percent increase from 2002. There was also a rise in the number of families relying on shelters, approximately 29,000. That is an increase of 80% from 2002. About half of the people who slept in shelter in 2010 returned for housing in 2011.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/05/san-francisco-s-homeless-count-reveals-drop-chronic-homelessness |title=San Francisco's homeless count reveals drop in chronic homelessness &#124; Bay City News &#124; Local &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628192727/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/05/san-francisco-s-homeless-count-reveals-drop-chronic-homelessness |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"wsws.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/apr2011/home-a26.shtml |title=Recordsetting homelessness in New York City - World Socialist Web Site |publisher=Wsws.org |date=April 26, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the NYC Department of Homeless Services, 64 percent of those applying for emergency shelter in 2010 were denied. Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] employs a deliberate policy of \"active deterrence\".\n\nPart of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes the United States' economic crisis. According to the [[Center for an Urban Future]] about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home. The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community Service Society, \"Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of near poor households\u2014up to twice the poverty level\u2014spend at least half of their incomes on rent&nbsp;... and place millions of low-income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement.\"\n\nThe [[New York City Housing Authority]] is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/11/budget-cuts-threaten-nyc-homeless-program/ |title=NYC Program To Help Homeless Won't Have The Funds To Help More \u00ab CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml \"Council, Public Advocate, Department of Homeless Services, and Coalition for the Homeless unite to oppose State's $65 million cut to the Adult Shelter System\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601195913/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml |date=June 1, 2010 }}, News Brief, NYC Department of Homeless Services, March 23, 2010</ref> The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets.

In 1990, the ban on begging in New York City's subway was challenged in ''Young v. New York City Transit Authority'', and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ban in this case did not infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcuah.com/lawsuit/federal/young.htm|title=Young v. New York City Transit Authority|website=Ahcuah.com |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> However, this precedent did not last long as it was seemingly overturned in 1993, in ''Loper v.

New York City Police Department rarely issued fines under this law, but used it to 'move on' beggars.<ref name=\":10\" /> In ''Loper'', the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found begging in this case to be a First Amendment right. And clarified that the ban on the subway system in the ''Young'' case was a reasonable limit as, even though it was publicly owned, panhandling in the confined space of the subway system can disrupt and startle passengers and potentially cause harm.<ref name=\":11\" /> Whereas, the blanket ban in all public spaces in the ''Loper'' case would leave beggars nowhere else for begging, which was considered an 'expressive activity' and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA similar judgement was made in ''International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee'' in regard to New York City's airports, which found it reasonable to ban such activities in airports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/672/case.html|title=International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.

While begging is protected under the First Amendment, certain cities have attempted to find ambiguity's in this right to freedom of speech, while others use more discretion when it comes to panhandling.\n\nThe city of Tacoma has passed laws which have quashed any form of panhandling in public forums.

For example, in 2010 an amendment was sponsored which would enable stronger panhandling laws that included a regulation against 'intimidating words and gestures' and obstructing someone's walking path.<ref name=\":31\">{{cite web|url=http://w.seattlestar.net/2014/10/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime/|title=The Seattle Star|last=Murphy|first=Raymond|date=|website=The Seattle Star|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Moreover, a $50 fine was proposed to be the punishment for anyone found to be 'aggressively panhandling.' While the bill was initially passed, Mayor Mike McGinn vetoed the bill. Yet despite this opposition to a call for certain regulations on panhandling, Mayor Ed Murray believed that it is imperative that existing laws are enforced. These current laws were enacted in 1987 and they are effectively an ordinance against aggressive panhandling. While this does represent similarities with Everett's laws, the laws in Seattle have been seen as largely discretionary and 'feel good legislation' which have been viewed ambiguously.<ref name=\":31\" /> \n\nThere are about 8,000 homeless individuals in Seattle on an average day.

The state of California has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the United States. As agricultural migrations have occurred and with urbanization spreading, empirical research and data analysis will be pivotal in understanding the major causes of homelessness. In order to determine solutions to mitigate and minimize homelessness, sociologist, non-governmental agencies (NGO\u2019s), and federal and state government agencies will need to work collectively to collaborate on curbing homelessness, not only in the state of California but throughout the entire United States. Current research has proven that people entering homelessness after the age of fifty, become homeless for environmental purposes rather than mental illness and substance abuse. \nAs the baby boomer generation retires and housing costs and financial crisis become more rampant and prevalent, understanding the difference between environmental causes versus traditional causes such as mental illness and drug addiction will be necessary. According to Individuals who first became homeless before age 50 had a higher prevalence of recent mental health and substance use problems and more difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (p.&nbsp;1)\u201d. Thus, education and compassion training will be extremely important, especially for Gen X and Gen Y, in order to understand reasonings behind homelessness and creating solutions.  In addition, housing programs and civic engagement will be extremely important and necessary as well.<ref>Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016).

Homelessness is a growing problem in the State of Colorado and is considered the most important social determinants of health (State of Colorado). Every individual deserves to live in good conditions and have their own home based on rights for housing. Some people do not realize that homelessness is very difficult for many individuals to escape with the continuous increase in costs for housing in Colorado along with mental health treatments and other factors. When people are forced to live without stable shelter they are then exposed to a number of risk factors that affect physical and mental health (State of Colorado). Although it is difficult to pin point any one cause of homelessness, there is a complicated combination of societal and individual causes. With the hard work of community organizations along with some helpful state initiatives, one would believe that homelessness can be escaped and even prevented.\n\nWhile he was Mayor of [[Denver, Colorado]], Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first \"State of the City\" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during the cold winters. In 2006, officials said that this number had risen over the past few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Homelessness/default.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512010632/http://www.denvergov.org/homelessness/Default.asp|url-status=dead|title=Redirect<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSome findings of the factors contributing to homelessness involve many issues. Among them was factual data about the number of residents that have moved to Colorado since 2011, totaling nearly 650 thousand.<ref>(United States Census Bureau, n.d)</ref> This influx of residents has caused a shortage in affordable housing and contributed to the price of homeownership and renting to increase yearly. The costs have become so expensive that a person has to make nearly four times the states minimum wage to afford a medium-priced rental. This model is unsustainable per the <ref>United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, [USICH], (2014)</ref> which describes rent as being considered affordable if it is less than thirty percent of total monthly income.  Another factor, is the perception that most people are homeless due to their own actions. While this may be true for a rare few, the majority are reluctant to seek services that could help better their situation due to fear of discrimination. Research conducted by,<ref>Johnston, Jetten, Dingle, Parsell and Walter (2016)</ref> shows that the homeless population are perceived as less than human and are not worthy of support or assistance, often they face contempt and prejudice amongst fellow homeless and the community. This is contributing to the perpetuation of chronic homelessness as people are too afraid to seek assistance and support. A third factor identified, is in how the cities are handling this demographic. There have been 350 \"anti-homeless\u201d ordinances enacted, which criminalize daily survival necessities of the homeless, but criminalizing these behaviors fails to mitigate the root causes, and maintains conditions that keep people homeless.<ref>(Ruan, 2018)</ref> While the cities have enacted these ordinances to combat hazards associated with the homeless such as fires, trash, crime and tent cities, it creates a revolving door of street to jail, jail to street.\n\nResearch has also indicated a vast shortage in shelter capabilities and resources. The number of homeless people, which in 2018 was nearly eleven thousand, consisted of families, veterans and chronically homeless.<ref>(USICH, n.d)</ref> According to,<ref>Ruan (2018)</ref> Denver, the state's capitol, can shelter less than ten percent of its homeless population, and other cities advertise their lack of shelters and resources in an effort to deter people from going to those cities. This means that people are forced to seek shelter wherever available and is usually in violation of one of the city ordinances, like the no camping ban. During the winter months shelters are on a first come, first serve basis, and people are often waiting for hours in the cold for the doors to open. This is especially challenging for those trying to work because if they are not in line at a certain time, they will likely not get shelter that evening. There are simply not enough shelters or resources to handle the entire homeless demographic, and too many limitations on getting into a shelter for the evening. This creates another burden on resources, accountable care organizations (ACO\u2019s) conducted research and found that housing needs had to be addressed before a person could effectively engage in medical treatment, and by addressing this issue first, medical cost were reduced by 53%.<ref>(Fraze, Lewis, Rodriguez and Fisher, 2016)</ref> Therefore, addressing housing needs can reduce medical treatment and further strain on resources. The research conducted has given great insight into the immense challenges the state and its homeless residents face. There are numerous factors contributing to homelessness, both individually and partially because of the cities themselves. The lack of shelters and strain on resources, contributes to the limited progress of addressing this issue. In order to make a significant impact, the state can adopt multiple new methods that were proven effective in other places to help curb the demographic much faster\n\nIn April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dezzutti|first1=Dominic|title=The True Motivation behind the Denver Camping Ban|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/04/01/the-true-motivation-behind-the-denver-camping-ban/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=April 2012}}</ref> Denver enacted the Urban Camping Ban due to the occupy Denver protest and the number of homeless on the 16th Street Mall. The ordinance was developed because businesses and individuals in Denver complained to the Mayor's office and City Council that the number of people who were sleeping in front of their business doorways and this was disruptive and made it uncomfortable for individuals to enter their businesses. In addition, Occupy Denver had taken over public space near the capital building in Denver and it became a homeless compound consisting of tents and other structures. The pressure to clean up Denver by businesses and other individuals on the Councilman Albus Brooks sponsored the legislation. Mayor Michael Hancock and City Council passed the urban camping ban which prohibited individuals from sleeping in public places with a blanket over them or something between them and the ground. Those who enact these laws often state it is the tool needed to encourage those who are not accessing services to find ways to address the issues that caused them to be homeless. The Civil Liberties Union wrote a strong letter in opposition to the Denver ordinance.\n\nThe number of homeless peoples increased from 2016 to 2017 by 1,121 <ref>Henry, M., Watt, R., Rosenthal, L., Shivji, A., & Associates A.

There is a shortage in Denver of mental health services for homeless people. The most common mental health issues among the homeless include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<ref>Jervis, R. (2014, August 28). Mental Disorders Keep Thousands of Homeless On Streets. , from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless-series/14255283/</ref> Therapy sessions, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and prescription drugs are the most common mental health treatment options for the public. However, the homeless are unable to afford them. There are organizations who strive to help the homeless by providing food, shelter, and clothes, but there are currently not many organizations focused only on improving the mental health in the homeless community of Denver. Housing the homeless has been proven to help reduce homelessness, but that does not solve the mental health issue that a lot of homeless people possess. If organizations adopt a new program to house the homeless, get them counseling, and then help them get a job and food on the table, this will enhance their quality of life and their recovery process. Thee effects of mental health and the number of homeless people with mental health issues would be drastically diminished through programs of this nature. Organizations currently use government funding, grants from private companies, and donations. New and more dynamic services for the homeless affected by mental health could be paid for in the same way. Those that oppose more dynamic mental health services for the homeless often rely on their own opinions rather than on facts such as \"the more help the homeless get, the more likely they are to get back on their feet and succeed\".<ref>Webster, P. (2017, December 9). Treatment and Recovery Are Not Optional in Solving Homelessness. from http://solutionsforchange.org/treatment-recovery-not-optional-solving-homelessness/</ref>\n\nThe homeless population over the last four years within the state of Colorado has remained fairly constant.  However, this does not mean that this is not an issue that needs to be addressed.  This is because while the overall population has remained stagnant the number of people who are choosing to be unsheltered is actually increasing steadily.  Why the homeless population total has remained constant within the midst of such a drastic economic boom can be seen within the data taken during the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time (PIT) Count.  According to HUD's PIT Count (2018)<ref>HUD 2018 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs Homeless Populations and Subpopulations. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/reportmanagement/published/CoC_PopSub_State_CO_2018.pdf.</ref> there are 10,857 people who are currently homeless within the state of Colorado.  This report also breaks down several aspects of the homeless population to include the biggest demographics that are currently homeless.  The biggest portion of homeless people can be categorized as those with mental illnesses.  These 2,171 people make up roughly 20 percent of the total population.  According to Bharadwaj, Pai, and Suziedelyte (2017)<ref>Bharadwaj, P., Pai, M., & Suziedelyte, A. (2017). Mental Health Stigma. Economics Letters, 159, 57-60. doi: 10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.028.</ref> people are less likely to report that they have a mental health issue when compared to other medical conditions that may be ailing them.  This stigma and fear of reporting is leading to many people deciding not to try and fight there disease on their own rather than seeking help.  Unfortunately this can lead to many of them becoming homeless or even worse suicide.  The second highest portion comes from those who are considered to be chronic substance abusers.  This population (1,999 people) make up approximately 18 percent.  The third highest demographic is Veterans who make up almost 10 percent of the total population or 1,073 people.  While the leading causes can be seen there is still a matter of how to handle this issue in order to reduce the number of people living on the street.  The best way to do this is to follow in Denver's footsteps and start a statewide outreach program that provides aid to the homeless population.  Currently Denver does this through and outreach court that is ran by the Denver Rescue Mission in which they help enroll them in Medicaid programs or help them get mental health assistance if they need it.  This program is currently ran every other Wednesday and since this is where the biggest portion of homeless people reside it would be beneficial for the state's program to run on the opposite Wednesdays.  The community also needs to buy into helping with this issue by getting drug and alcohol counselors, rehabilitation centers, and the VA Hospital engaged with helping the population during these outreach days.  The community must ban together in order to take care of the homeless population and get more people off of the streets and into a home.\n\n'''Organizational Contribution and Youth Homelessness'''\n\nThe Colorado Coalition for the Homeless has been around since 1984 and claims to have turned around tens of thousands of homeless people in Colorado. The Stout Street Health Center provided 114,706 care visits and helped 778 U.S. veterans with various health services and housing, as of 2018 (Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, n.d.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloradocoalition.org/|title=Colorado Coalition for the Homeless|website=www.coloradocoalition.org|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> Other organizations, such as Urban Peak Colorado Springs (UPCS), are helping to support homeless youth in the area by providing clean clothes, connections to shelters, or even housing in the area (n.d.).<ref name=\"About Urban Peak Colorado Springs\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanpeak.org/colorado-springs/about-us/about-urban-peak/about-urban-peak-colorado-springs/|title=About Urban Peak Colorado Springs|website=Urban Peak|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> Regardless of how positive the organizations are with services and how many people have gone through successfully, more help is needed.

When focusing on the laws against begging and panhandling it is important to begin with the fact that people become beggars and panhandlers for various reasons. They could be in that situation because of socio-economic issues, disability, loss of income due to natural disasters, discrimination due to being a minority group, lack of education, health issues and many more. Consequently, the approach to these social issues must be responsive to people's needs to help them escape poverty and the need to beg.\n\nThe state of Florida deals with panhandling and begging in a variety of ways, like the rest of the United States.

For example, in [[Alachua County, Florida]], police can issue 'Notice to Appear' options for many offences, including panhandling, but this requires a permanent address. Many panhandlers do not have an address, and consequently the police must arrest the individual, placing them in jails instead of dealing with their homelessness.<ref name=\":9\" /> The NLCHP also published a report, \"No Safe Place,\" which highlights one of Florida's cities with the strongest criminalization policies: [[Clearwater, Florida]]. Clearwater has nearly half of its homeless population (42%) without access to emergency housing or affordable housing and, like other cities such as Orlando, heavily punishes sleeping or sitting in public and panhandling or begging.<ref>No Safe Place.

The [[Central Atlanta Progress|Central Atlanta Progress (CAP)]] was one of the most notable voices in Atlanta promoting these sort of initiatives. For example, their first major initiative was to criminalize homelessness. They saw the homeless population as a threat to public safety. However, their efforts were met with conflicted responses from police and Georgian citizens due to the large size and demographic makeup of the homeless population in Atlanta. Majority of this group's makeup were black males. On top of that, Atlanta's first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], had been recently elected into office. Having successfully elected a black male into office, the topic of race and politics was prominent in the minds of many Georgian citizens.<ref name=\":04\" /> The idea to criminalize homelessness looked bad in the eyes of these citizens and created a lot of skepticism about the CAP's true purpose.

Prohibitions, including loitering and sleeping outdoors, have expanded to include strict panhandling restraints. These do not necessarily include complete bans, but can cover when, where and how panhandling can be legally conducted. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]], gives that this is a result of gentrification coupled with Hawaii's dependence on tourism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Loew|first1=Tracy|title=Panhandling laws spreading|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jan/24/ln/hawaii801240357.html|accessdate=December 18, 2016|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2013 alone, tourism in Hawaii generated $14.5 billion, which averaged $39 million per day.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hawaii Tourism Authority|title=Hawaii Tourism Facts |url=http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/9_1%20HTA%20Factsheet%20as%20of%20May%201%202014%20Final.pdf|website=Hawaii Tourism Authority|publisher=State of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> This major sector is therefore a vital consideration in panhandling legislation.\n\nHawaiian locals and business operators such as Dave Moskowitz agree with these restraints, arguing that panhandling is bad for tourism.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nPolice, on the other hand, give that panhandling is not a prominent issue, nor is it prioritized.<ref name=Scott2002>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Michael S.|title=Panhandling|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016|agency=Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)|issue=13|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222002932/https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/cd_rom/inaction1/pubs/Panhandling.pdf|archive-date=December 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Legally, ethically and practically, it is difficult for police to enforce strict panhandling laws at all times, thus police discretion plays a vital role in determining who is cited and how many citations are given.\n\nFor the panhandling population who are cited, there is a general feeling of indifference, perhaps even disregard. Ralph McCarroll, for example, says that he has 30 citations and that law enforcement knows that he is never going to pay them.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> A number of studies indicate that the average panhandler is an unmarried, unemployed male in his 30s to 40s, often with drug/alcohol problems, a lack of social support and laborer's skills.<ref name=Scott2002 /> These factors are likely to affect the poor perception of these laws in the panhandling population.\n\nSocial justice advocates and non-governmental organizations will argue that this approach is therefore counter-intuitive. They argue that panhandling laws violate free speech, criminalize homelessness and remove an essential part of destitute people's lives. Doran Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, argues that these laws merely deal with the symptoms of homelessness rather than fixing the problem.<ref name=HonoluluAdvertiser2007 />\n\nThe role of the court is essential in clarifying whether the laws are constitutionally valid. In 2015, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Hawaii foundation (ACLUH) paired with Davis Levin Livingston Law Firm to represent Justin Guy in suit against the Hawaii County. Guy's lawyers argued that prohibiting their client from holding up a sign that read 'Homeless Please Help' offended his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.<ref name=ACLU2016>{{cite web|author1=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|title=Settlement in Hawaii County|url=https://acluhi.org/2015/09/14/settlement-in-hawaii-county-free-speech-case/|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii|accessdate=December 18, 2016|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Matthew Winter, a lawyer on the case, made reference to political candidates (who are lawfully able to hold signs), to contrast against the inability of the poor to hold up signs asking for help.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> The court ruled in Guy's favour, which led to an award of $80,000 compensation and repeal of subsections 14-74, 14-75, 15-9, 15-20, 15-21, 15-35 and 15-37 of the Hawaii County Code. In a statement, Guy emphasized the need for the State of Hawaii to treat the homeless with the same dignity as the general population.<ref name=ACLU2016 /> This court ruling is a positive step in that direction.\n\nThe future of panhandling laws in Hawaii is reliant on legislators and their perception of panhandling's impact on tourism. By utilizing aggressive political language, such as 'the war on homelessness' and 'emergency state,' Hawaiian politics will continue to criminalize the behaviours of destitute populations. On the other hand, with pressure from state/federal departments and non-governmental organizations, restrictions on panhandling laws may be possible. The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]], for example, has stated that it would not provide homeless assistance funds to states that criminalize homelessness.<ref name=NYtimes2016 /> Given that Hawaii has one of the USA's largest growing homeless populations (between 2007 and 2016, Hawaii saw a 30.5% increase in homelessness), it is in a poor position to reject federal funding and assistance from non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite news|author1=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|title=The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress |url=https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf|accessdate=December 18, 2016 |agency=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|publisher=United States Federal Government|date=November 2016}}</ref> Due to these factors, recent court disapproval, repeals and police discretion, it is likely that over time strict panhandling laws in Hawaii will lessen in severity.\n\n==Illinois==\nOver the years, the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and [[New York City]], although no statistical data have backed this up. The reputation stems primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets rather than any sort of objective statistical census data.

The one-day count was conducted by 1,200 volunteers around 400 locations known to attract homeless such as transitional housing, shelters, drop in sites, hot meal programs and church basements.

Individual responses neither collectively favoured negative or positive responses for the interaction between police and panhandlers. Examples of responses include that the police 'give you trouble', tell them to 'get the hell out of here' and 'give you a ticket', while other individuals believed that police were 'usually understanding', 'gentle' and 'very friendly and helpful'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ststephensmpls.org/sites/default/files/why-i-beg.pdf|title=Why I Beg|last=|first=|date=|website=Ststephensmpls.org|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Minneapolis' anti-begging law was overturned due to its breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the right to free speech. As a result of this response, the city council of Minneapolis collectively agreed to implement a modified version of the anti begging law. Although panhandlers are protected by the First Amendment, those who aggressively solicit and/or in prohibited locations are in the act of violating the Minneapolis City Ordinance 385.60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbrooklyncenter.org/index.aspx?NID=1074|title=Brooklyn Center, MN - Official Website - Panhandlers|website=Cityofbrooklyncenter.org |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> This regulation is violated when an individual offers a service of low value for a donation or verbally requests for an object or money in locations such as the entry way of a government building, near a parked vehicle, near public transport, in or near a restroom, on a crosswalk, entertainment venues, petrol station, convenience store or near a financial establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legalbeagle.com/12010836-can-arrested-panhandling.html|title=Can You Get Arrested for Panhandling?|website=Legal Beagle |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The individual must also use either physical contact, threaten criminal activity upon property, block entrances, stalk, use abusive language, suggest body mutilation if not given money, beg in groups of more than one person, beg under the influence of drugs or alcohol and solicit in the night hours after sunset and before sunrise in those areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/police/report/police_crime-reporting_aggressivepanhandling|title=Aggressive Panhandling|website=Minneapolismn.gov |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> The purpose of the Minneapolis city ordinance 385.60 is to protect the public for being hounded by panhandlers at certain locations. However, law in the state of Minnesota does not prohibit passive panhandling, such as holding a sign without verbal interaction and focuses on [[aggressive panhandling]] as a breach of the law. Other cities in Minnesota such as [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], [[Brooklyn Center, Minnesota|Brooklyn Center]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St Paul]] have similar versions of the ordinance and have all avoided judicial scrutiny on the grounds of protecting individual privacy against [[assault]] based behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/is-minneapolis-begging-law-doomed/363962261/|title=Is Minneapolis' begging law doomed?|newspaper=Star Tribune|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEfforts by the population of Minnesota to redirect the money given to panhandlers to organizations that aim to end homelessness have been implemented in the city of Minneapolis. An example of this is 'Give Real Change', a campaign that began in 2009 with the aim to end homelessness for 300 to 500 people in areas within Minneapolis by the end of 2025. Billboards implemented by the campaign that display 'Say NO To Panhandling and YES To Giving,' urge community members to stop giving money to beggars and alternatively donate it to an organization that allocates money to shelters to end homelessness.

Through a demographic examination it becomes evident that New Mexico has a high proportion of ethnographies that are currently and historically socioeconomically disadvantaged.<ref>Norris, Tina; Vines, Paula L.; Hoeffel, Elizabeth M. (February 2012). \"The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010\" (PDF). Census 2010 Brief. United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 1, 2012.</ref> Native Americans as a proportion of the US population represent the second highest amongst all States with only Alaska  having a higher ratio, while it also has a large Hispanic population. Homelessness is a direct cause from an individual not being able to provide themselves with the most basic of necessities to maintain a healthy life hence having a higher proportion of individuals in poverty places a greater risk of an individual becoming homeless. A study into cost of homelessness on the state government of New Mexico concluded that, on a per nightly basis, emergency shelter costs $30; supportive housing $33, state penitentiary $77, Santa Fe County Detention Centre $82, St Vincent Hospital $550 and UNM Hospital $71.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Which study?  Cite the study.}}  Homelessness by and large is caused by or as a result of health care complications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=}} One need only  consider ailments such as addiction, psychological disorders, HIV/AIDS and an array of other ailments that require consistent long term care that cannot be well managed in an unsafe, unpredictable environment that confronts most homeless.\n\nInability to adequately manage these medical problems places a further economic burden on the state as the frequency and duration of hospital visits may increase. This phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that on average homeless spent four days longer than comparable non-homeless, costing the State approximately $2,414 per hospitalization. Homelessness causes both serious mental and physical anguish as evidenced by the fact that a homeless person's psychiatric hospitalization rate is 100 times more than their non-homeless compatriot.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this paragraph.}}\n\nDue to New Mexico's strong laws against loitering, sleeping in cars and begging (traits a lot of homeless people are forced to do) they are disproportionately over-represented in the prison system. Police officials can accuse any person they believe may have attempted to disrupt the peace, regardless of whether or not the offense presents danger to the community. Panhandling is an umbrella term that represents begging, sponging and spanging. In the state of New Mexico there are strict regulations on panhandling. Moreover, homeless people are prohibited to beg after dark and if they do they are often sent to jail. In an attempt to remove homeless people from the streets, it is common for the police to dispose of their property.  The above conditions cause the mere act of being homeless to become a self-perpetuating cycle of crime.{{citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=There are no citations for any of the info in this entire paragraph.}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional \"right to shelter\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |title=NYC Department of Homeless Services |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* 27,844 adults\n* 20,627 children\n* 48,471 total individuals\n\nAccording to the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], the homeless population of New York rose to an all-time high in 2011. A reported 113,552 people slept in the city's emergency shelters last year, including over 40,000 children; marking an 8 percent increase from the previous year and a 37 percent increase from 2002. There was also a rise in the number of families relying on shelters, approximately 29,000. That is an increase of 80% from 2002. About half of the people who slept in shelter in 2010 returned for housing in 2011.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/05/san-francisco-s-homeless-count-reveals-drop-chronic-homelessness |title=San Francisco's homeless count reveals drop in chronic homelessness &#124; Bay City News &#124; Local &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628192727/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/05/san-francisco-s-homeless-count-reveals-drop-chronic-homelessness |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"wsws.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/apr2011/home-a26.shtml |title=Recordsetting homelessness in New York City - World Socialist Web Site |publisher=Wsws.org |date=April 26, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the NYC Department of Homeless Services, 64 percent of those applying for emergency shelter in 2010 were denied. Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] employs a deliberate policy of \"active deterrence\".\n\nPart of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes the United States' economic crisis. According to the [[Center for an Urban Future]] about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home. The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community Service Society, \"Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of near poor households\u2014up to twice the poverty level\u2014spend at least half of their incomes on rent&nbsp;... and place millions of low-income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement.\"\n\nThe [[New York City Housing Authority]] is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/11/budget-cuts-threaten-nyc-homeless-program/ |title=NYC Program To Help Homeless Won't Have The Funds To Help More \u00ab CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml \"Council, Public Advocate, Department of Homeless Services, and Coalition for the Homeless unite to oppose State's $65 million cut to the Adult Shelter System\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601195913/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/press/pr032310.shtml |date=June 1, 2010 }}, News Brief, NYC Department of Homeless Services, March 23, 2010</ref> The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets.

In 1990, the ban on begging in New York City's subway was challenged in ''Young v. New York City Transit Authority'', and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ban in this case did not infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcuah.com/lawsuit/federal/young.htm|title=Young v. New York City Transit Authority|website=Ahcuah.com |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref> However, this precedent did not last long as it was seemingly overturned in 1993, in ''Loper v.

New York City Police Department rarely issued fines under this law, but used it to 'move on' beggars.<ref name=\":10\" /> In ''Loper'', the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found begging in this case to be a First Amendment right. And clarified that the ban on the subway system in the ''Young'' case was a reasonable limit as, even though it was publicly owned, panhandling in the confined space of the subway system can disrupt and startle passengers and potentially cause harm.<ref name=\":11\" /> Whereas, the blanket ban in all public spaces in the ''Loper'' case would leave beggars nowhere else for begging, which was considered an 'expressive activity' and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA similar judgement was made in ''International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee'' in regard to New York City's airports, which found it reasonable to ban such activities in airports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/672/case.html|title=International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.

There is also conflicting motivations for further restricting panhandling in the area, with discourses around both the safety as well as the legitimacy of panhandling taking place, particularly in the local media.\n\n==Washington, D.C.==\nThe [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] estimated in 2013 the number of homeless in [[Washington, D.C.]] as 6,865, which was a 29 percent increase after 2007.<ref>Wiener, Aaron.

While begging is protected under the First Amendment, certain cities have attempted to find ambiguity's in this right to freedom of speech, while others use more discretion when it comes to panhandling.\n\nThe city of Tacoma has passed laws which have quashed any form of panhandling in public forums. Panhandling is banned anywhere which is within 15 feet of ATMs, bus stops, pay phones, parked cars, gas stations, outdoor stations, cafes and carwashes within the city.<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite news|url=http://crosscut.com/2007/12/tacomas-panhandling-ban-where-did-they-all-go/|title=Tacoma's panhandling ban: Where did they all go?|date=December 4, 2007 |newspaper=Crosscut|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> More specifically, it is illegal on buses, freeway ramps and on intersections. Moreover, in the hours between sunset and sunrise, it is prohibited entirely. Those who are found to be in breach of this ordinance could be penalized with 90 days in jail or be fined $1000.<ref name=\":29\" /> While the city of Arlington's laws are not as strict, with panhandling being banned anywhere within 300 feet of these certain areas, violators too can be met with the same harsh forms of punishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realchangenews.org/2014/08/06/ban-panhandling-snohomish-county-city-arlington-exemplifies-national-trend|title=With ban on panhandling, Snohomish County city of Arlington exemplifies national trend|last=Burkhalter|first=Aaron|date=August 6, 2014 |website=Real Change |publisher=Disqus |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> A more controversial law was passed in October 2015, when the city of Everett amended previous code which categorised 'aggressive panhandling' as just a misdemeanour.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/news/everett-passes-measure-against-aggressive-panhandling/|title=Everett passes measure against 'aggressive panhandling' {{!}} HeraldNet.com|date=October 28, 2015 |newspaper=HeraldNet.com|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> This new law prevents begging 'in a manner that hinders or obstructs the free passage of any person in a public place' or begging that 'intentionally causes or attempts to cause another person to reasonably fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon their person, or upon property in their immediate possession.' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Everett/?Everett09/Everett0952.html|title=Everett Municipal Code|website=Codepublishing.com|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> The passing of the law has been met with mass condemnation, with many critics saying it criminalizes homelessness, while the ACLU called it 'unconstitutional, ineffective and unnecessarily costly and punitive.' <ref name=\":30\" />\n\nFurther opposition to criminalising begging was demonstrated recently when the city of Lakewood's anti-panhandling ordinance was deemed unconstitutional in the case ''The City of Lakewood v Robert W. Willis.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aclu-wa.org/node/7552|title=WA Supreme Court: Lakewood's ban on panhandling violates free speech rights|date=July 22, 2016 |website=American Civil Liberties Union of Washington|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Laws were considered 'overbroad' by the courts as they restrict panhandling in several locations without seeing if there is actually obstruction of traffic. This case has also led to a discussion surrounding whether to charge an individual with obstructing traffic or with begging.\n\n===City of Seattle===\n{{Main|Homelessness in Seattle}}\nThe city of Seattle's stance on panhandling is not as hardline as many other cities in Washington. For example, in 2010 an amendment was sponsored which would enable stronger panhandling laws that included a regulation against 'intimidating words and gestures' and obstructing someone's walking path.<ref name=\":31\">{{cite web|url=http://w.seattlestar.net/2014/10/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime/|title=The Seattle Star|last=Murphy|first=Raymond|date=|website=The Seattle Star|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> Moreover, a $50 fine was proposed to be the punishment for anyone found to be 'aggressively panhandling.' While the bill was initially passed, Mayor Mike McGinn vetoed the bill. Yet despite this opposition to a call for certain regulations on panhandling, Mayor Ed Murray believed that it is imperative that existing laws are enforced. These current laws were enacted in 1987 and they are effectively an ordinance against aggressive panhandling. While this does represent similarities with Everett's laws, the laws in Seattle have been seen as largely discretionary and 'feel good legislation' which have been viewed ambiguously.<ref name=\":31\" /> \n\nThere are about 8,000 homeless individuals in Seattle on an average day. The \"One Night Count\" in 2015 found 10,047 individuals homeless in the 3rd week in January, in King County. 3,772 individuals were without shelter in King County. 2,804 were without shelter in Seattle.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Kadi, J., & Ronald, R.

It has a population of around 13,500 and stands in the [[Rhymney Valley]]. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the coming of [[coal mining]] in the [[South Wales Coalfield]] the valley was rural and farmed. It lies in the [[Community (Wales)|community]] of [[Gelligaer]].\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nIn the [[Welsh language]], ''ystrad'' is a wide flat bottomed [[valley]]. The termination ''ach'' is associated with the names of marshy floodplains of rivers and is also found nearby in the names ''Llanbradach'' and ''Llancaiach''. Ystrad Mynach is a corruption of Ystrad-Man-Ach (''man'' = place) and is not derived from the Welsh ''mynach'' meaning [[monk]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gelligaer Urban District Council|title=The Gelligaer Story|publisher=Gelligaer Urban District Council|year=1959}}</ref> Prior to erection of defences on the River Rhymney in the 1960s the town was indeed subject to periodic flooding.\n\n== Amenities and history ==\nThe town houses a number of [[Caerphilly County Borough Council|council]] offices, as well as [[Ystrad Mynach College|the Ystrad Mynach campus of Coleg y Cymoedd]], a [[further education]] college established in 1959 to provide training for local [[coal]] miners and merged with neighbouring [[Coleg Morgannwg]] to form Coleg y Cymoedd in 2013.\n\nThe nearby [[Penallta Colliery]] was the last [[coal mining|coal mine]] to close in the valley.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev.

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.  Undergraduate students at the college come from 35 states and 17 countries. Saint Michael's has 155 full-time faculty members; creating a 12:1 student to faculty ratio on campus. There are 439 graduate students who attend the college; over 90 percent are from Vermont.\n\n===Sustainability===\n\nSaint Michael's has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years.  It was named the first fair trade school in Vermont.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/93498/saint-michaels-designated-fair-trade-college/|title=VPR: Saint Michael's College Designated Fair Trade College|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  Along with the initiatives in the cafeteria, Saint Michael's has an organic garden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smcvtfarm.blogspot.com/2013/06/organic-garden-seminar-series.html|title=SMC Organic Garden|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> that started in 2008 and has grown into a huge project for students and faculty alike.

Saint Michael's College also took the St. Francis Pledge, a promise and commitment by Catholic individuals, families, parishes, organizations, and institutions to live their faith by protecting the environment and advocating on behalf of people in poverty who face the harshest impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicclimatecovenant.org/the-st-francis-pledge/|title=The St. Francis Pledge|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  As part of the college's ban on bottled water, the Office of Sustainability<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/Green-Campus.aspx|title=Green Campus|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> has installed several water bottle fill stations throughout campus, allowing students to more easily use their reusable water bottles.  Saint Michael's College has been recycling throughout the campus since 1989 and also takes steps toward improving energy such as the Light Bulb Exchange Program (switching out standard light bulbs for energy efficient light bulbs) and 3 Degree Challenge (lowering temperatures in residence halls and academic buildings) while working to increase the energy and electrical efficiency of campus buildings.  Two most recently constructed campus buildings, The Dion Family Center and Residence Hall Four use geothermal wells to meet the greater majority of their heating needs. Combined with many education programs on energy consumption run by the Office of Sustainability, the college has reduced its carbon footprint by 29% since 2003.

Saint Michael's College grants [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in over 30 majors to their 1,600 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu/academics/majors-minors-and-curriculum.aspx|title=Majors, Minors, & Programs|website=www.smcvt.edu}}</ref> Housing availability is guaranteed for all four years although about 10% of students, primarily upperclassmen, live off campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/on-campus/housing-and-dining/living-at-st-mikes.aspx|title=Living at St Mike's|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1889, priests from the [[Society of Saint Edmund]] fled to the United States after [[Anti-clericalism#The Third Republic|widespread anticlericism seized France]]. In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev.

All dorm students said the rosary before retiring.<ref name=\"bfp090614\"/>\n\nSaint Michael's Applied Linguistics Department was started in 1954, focusing on teaching English to students from around the world.\n\nAbout 130 refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] came to the college.

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.  Undergraduate students at the college come from 35 states and 17 countries. Saint Michael's has 155 full-time faculty members; creating a 12:1 student to faculty ratio on campus. There are 439 graduate students who attend the college; over 90 percent are from Vermont.\n\n===Sustainability===\n\nSaint Michael's has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years.  It was named the first fair trade school in Vermont.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/93498/saint-michaels-designated-fair-trade-college/|title=VPR: Saint Michael's College Designated Fair Trade College|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  Along with the initiatives in the cafeteria, Saint Michael's has an organic garden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smcvtfarm.blogspot.com/2013/06/organic-garden-seminar-series.html|title=SMC Organic Garden|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> that started in 2008 and has grown into a huge project for students and faculty alike.  The garden utilizes student volunteers through the Mobilization of Volunteer Efforts (MOVE)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu:443/Experience/Service-and-Activism/Move-Program|title=MOVE|website=www.smcvt.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2017}} program and also works with summer interns and crew members to prepare the vegetables for Farm Stands that run from mid-summer through the beginning of fall.  The school also provides a free CCTA{{clarify|date=November 2017}} commuter pass to all students, staff, and faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctaride.org/programs/unlimited-access.html|title=CCTA: Unlimited Access Program|access-date=June 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824010255/http://cctaride.org/programs/unlimited-access.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  To improve water conservation, dual-flush handles for toilets have begun to be installed in various buildings around campus. All campus showerheads and sink aerators are low flow.  Saint Michael's College also took the St. Francis Pledge, a promise and commitment by Catholic individuals, families, parishes, organizations, and institutions to live their faith by protecting the environment and advocating on behalf of people in poverty who face the harshest impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicclimatecovenant.org/the-st-francis-pledge/|title=The St. Francis Pledge|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  As part of the college's ban on bottled water, the Office of Sustainability<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/Green-Campus.aspx|title=Green Campus|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> has installed several water bottle fill stations throughout campus, allowing students to more easily use their reusable water bottles.  Saint Michael's College has been recycling throughout the campus since 1989 and also takes steps toward improving energy such as the Light Bulb Exchange Program (switching out standard light bulbs for energy efficient light bulbs) and 3 Degree Challenge (lowering temperatures in residence halls and academic buildings) while working to increase the energy and electrical efficiency of campus buildings.  Two most recently constructed campus buildings, The Dion Family Center and Residence Hall Four use geothermal wells to meet the greater majority of their heating needs. Combined with many education programs on energy consumption run by the Office of Sustainability, the college has reduced its carbon footprint by 29% since 2003.  Saint Michael's also offers both [[Environmental Studies]] and [[Environmental Science]] majors and an [[Environmental Studies]] minor for those students interested in further focusing on the environment from the perspective of natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.\n\n===Housing===\nStudents at Saint Michael's College live in a variety of different housing facilities.  All housing is single-sex by floor or wing.\n\n====Main campus====\n*Joyce Hall, Ryan Hall, and Lyons Hall are three of the four main quad dormitories.

Some wings are reserved for Honors Housing and GREAT Housing, the alcohol-free living option.\n*Alumni Hall is the fourth dormitory building on the main quad, and houses sophomores and juniors.\n*Cashman Hall, Pontigny Hall, and Canterbury Hall consist of four and eight person suites for sophomores, juniors, and some seniors.  Many suites are reserved for Honors Housing, GREAT Housing, and Ambassador Housing.\n*Hodson and the newest building on campus, Residence Hall 4, are apartment style housing for juniors and seniors.\n*The Townhouses, numbered in series; 100s, 200s, 300s,and 400s, house seniors in apartment-style living. In the summer of 2008, kitchens were added to the 400s in order to accommodate the senior housing initiative.\n\n====Major additions====\n\nThe Dion Family Student Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/dion-family-student-center.aspx|title=Dion Family Student Center|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}</ref> is a $30 million structure creating a new 40,000 square-foot student center and 43,000 square-foot residence hall on campus, completed in the fall of 2013.

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''.

Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith).

He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Helen Roper]] and her husband [[Stanley Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Audra Lindley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

In 1979 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him #27 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.<ref>{{cite book |title = TV Guide Guide to TV |year = 2004 |publisher = Barnes and Noble |isbn = 0-7607-5634-1 |page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 596] |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 }}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nJesse Donald Knotts was born in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (''n\u00e9e'' Moore). His parents were married in [[Spraggs, Pennsylvania]]. His [[English people|English]] paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph.\n\nDon's mother was 40 at the time of his birth and his father suffered from mental illness; he had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stress of Don's birth. Afflicted with [[schizophrenia]] and [[alcoholism]], he sometimes terrorized Don with a knife,<ref>{{cite book |last = de Vis\u00e9 |first = Daniel |date = 2015 |title = Andy and Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show |page = 5 |location = New York |publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn = 1-4767-4773-3 }}</ref> causing Don to turn inward at an early age. The elder Knotts died of [[pneumonia]] when Don was 13 years old. Don and his three brothers were then raised by their mother, who ran a [[boarding house]] in Morgantown. She died in 1969 at age 84. Her son William preceded her in death in 1941 at age 31. They are buried in the family plot at Beverly Hills Memorial Park in Morgantown. Don graduated from [[Morgantown High School]].

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.\n\n=== ''The Andy Griffith Show'' ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Don Knotts 1960.JPG|thumb|As Barney Fife, Knotts gets the help of Sheriff Taylor when his gun gets stuck on his finger]]\n[[File:DonKnotts1961.jpg|thumb|Knotts receives his first [[Emmy Award]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1961]]\nIn 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own [[sitcom]], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960\u20131968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy]], three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.<ref>{{cite book |last = Monush |first = Barry |title = Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965 |volume = 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn = 1-55783-551-9 |page = 397 }}</ref>\n\nA summary of the show from the website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Deputy Barney Fife:\n\n{{quote|Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Helen Roper]] and her husband [[Stanley Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Audra Lindley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

It was founded by French missionary P\u00e9re Jules Leman [[CSSp]] in 1860 as a school and civil service training centre.\n\nThe college, {{convert|7|km|miles}} from Dublin city centre, is just in from the sea, and is self-contained, with large boarding and teaching facilities in 56 acres of rolling parkland. It accommodates approximately 1,000 day and boarding students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119060046/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nNow run by a lay foundation in trust, it maintains academic standards and requires all pupils to participate in non-academic activities, and it has a strong sporting tradition. The missionary tradition continues with charity programmes, especially at Christmas.\n\n==History==\nThe college was founded by the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]] in 1860, the first of the Order's five schools in Ireland. The founder is listed as Fr (P\u00e8re) Jules Leman, a French missionary with the Holy Ghost Order. Leman had a dual aim, namely to train personnel for missionary service in the Third World and provide a first class Catholic education for Irish boys. It was originally known as the ''French College'' by the locals. A successful [[civil service]] training and university department (where students were examined and had degrees conferred by the [[Royal University of Ireland]]) were run for over forty years, until [[University College Dublin]] grew, and the school focused more on the second level curriculum.\n\nAlthough never a seminary, some ordinations have taken place in Blackrock. The first ordination at Blackrock College was on 22 April 1900 when Mgr. Emile Allgeyer CSSp (a former student in Blackrock and first to be made a bishop), ordained [[Joseph (Ignatius) Shanahan|Joseph Shanahan]] who later became a bishop, and has a House named after him within the school.<ref>[http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html Bishop Joseph Shanahan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217113518/http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html |date=17 February 2001 }} www.spiritan.org.</ref> From 1924 until 1933 the Holy Ghost Fathers studied Theology at Blackrock Castle, before returning to Kimmage Manor.\n\nIn June 1932, college President [[John Charles McQuaid]], hosted a large garden party on the grounds of the college to welcome the papal legate, [[Lorenzo Lauri]], where the many hundreds of bishops assembled for the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]] had the opportunity to mingle with a huge gathering of distinguished guests, including President of the Executive Council, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], and others who had paid a modest subscription fee.<ref>The Church in Dublin: 1940-1965, by Roland Burke Savage, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Winter 1965</ref>\n\n===Heraldry===\nThe crest of the college is the third creation, dating back to 1936 and explained in the 1937 College Annual as being: <blockquote>The Heraldic Crest Of The College. ARGENT: - On a Cross Azure, the Dove of the Holy Ghost, Proper, with seven Rays descendant, Or. In the first quarter a Lion rampant of the second.</blockquote>\n\nOn 30 April 1926, Fr. Leen at a sports day speech encapsulated the words ''Fides Et Robur'' which henceforth became the Rock motto. In 1928, a new College Crest, bearing four emblems around a blue cross was hurriedly officiated, primarily to show off the Fides Et Robur motto over the College's especially built new front gates. Not everyone was happy with this design and possible variations of a new design may have been experimented with; evidence exists that both in crest and in uniform, by reason of fault or debate, and most likely between 1928 and 1936, a distinctive crest had been \"with nine rays descendant, Or\". In 1936, Dr. McQuaid instigated a new and distinctive crest that to this day is in continual use (unchecked variations and wayward deviations are contracted into stores by stationery and uniform suppliers). It was adapted on blazers that year and a heraldic description of the arms of the College was published (though not officially registered) in the 1937 Blackrock College Annual. It was commissioned into stained glass in 1938, presumably in its true and intended likeness and survives today at the end of one of the house corridors, though its conformity to the true heraldic interpretations are not accurate; \"a Lion Rampant of the second\" would correctly reveal only a blue silhouette of a rampant lion, that is, minus any fine caricature details so apparent in the existing variations.<ref>(Farragher, S. and Wyer, A.

The members of each house are chosen in second year by the captains, and a student remains within the same house throughout his time at the school. There are two house captains who lead each house in each year, except transition year in which there are three captains per house. They act as leaders and one from each year is chosen to represent the year on the student council. The captains are elected democratically every year by members of their house. They lead house meeting and make sure everyone in their house partakes in the school's various inter house events.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum offered is broad, covering all common subjects in the State Examinations including Latin, German, Art, Music, Business, Materials Technology Wood, Science and History.

These two buildings are connected via the central St. Patricks Corridor and the entrance corridor. Several other wings contain community facilities as well as other classrooms and subject specific rooms. The quadrangle or \"quad\" is a large green area surrounded by the senior wing, the chapel and St. Mary's Corridor. The campus is {{convert|0.25|km2|acre}} and contains nine rugby pitches, a cricket lawn, an athletics track, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, six tennis courts, basketball courts, hammer throw field and indoor halls.\n\nApart from classrooms and three study halls, there are nine science laboratories, a woodwork room, a radio studio, three computer rooms, a digital communications and graphics room, an art room, a choir hall, a multimedia room and a home economics kitchen. The college also contains a refectory, chapel, creative arts and digital learning centre, lecture halls and stage which hosts student-run dramatic productions. The college is undergoing an extensive modernisation programme, currently the pitches are being transformed and roads around the school rerouted.\n\n==Boarding school==\nThe boarding school is housed in Williamstown Castle (known by students as \"The Castle\"). Williamstown Castle was built around 1780 on lands rented by the Fitzwilliams, later Pembrokes, to Counsellor William Vavasour.  It resembled other spacious houses in the area including Willow Park and Castledawson, but a later owner, Thomas O'Mara, extensively redeveloped the building and its surrounds, adding the castellated finish, hence making it into a 'castle'.  O'Mara had acted as an election agent for [[Daniel O'Connell]], who dined in the Castle on occasion, and for years a portrait of O'Connell adorned the room which is now the oratory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003242/http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Niall MacDermott is the Director of Boarding in the college.

Boarders are allowed to leave the castle with permission.\n\n== Extra curricular activities ==\n\n=== Field sports ===\nSport is viewed as an integral part of a boy's education and each pupil is expected to participate in some activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |title=Blackrock College: About Us: Prospective Students |publisher=Blackrockcollege.ie |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616021609/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The principal sport in the college is rugby, with Blackrock having won the [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] 69 times. It has also won the [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]] 51 times. Blackrock won the inaugural Cup competition held in 1887 and have been consistently the most successful team, winning the Cup at least three times in every decade since.\n\nRetired Blackrock rugby union players include [[Fergus Slattery]], [[Niall Brophy]], [[Hugo MacNeill (rugby union)|Hugo MacNeill]] and [[Brendan Mullin]] (all playing before rugby union was professional), former [[British and Irish Lions]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[Leinster rugby|Leinster]] captain [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Victor Costello]],  [[Luke Fitzgerald]], and the current Leinster Rugby Head Coach and former Irish international [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]]. Current professional players include Bristol and Ireland's [[Ian Madigan]], Leinster and Ireland players Garry Ringrose and Jordi Murphy, Munster and Ireland's Andrew Conway and Joey Carbery, Sale Sharks and US Eagles' AJ MacGinty and multiple others around Ireland and the world.\n[[File:Rockleinster.jpg|thumb|250px|Blackrock v St Michael's 2006 [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] final at [[Lansdowne Road]]]]\n\n[[Gaelic football]] is played in 4th year in the college. Past pupils [[Mark Vaughan]] and [[Niall Corkery]] are forwards on the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] [[Gaelic football]] team. The school also has a [[hurling]] team for 2nd and 3rd years. Five members of the All Ireland Club Championship winning Kilmacud Crokes team of 2008\u201309 were past pupils of Blackrock College. The college has a soccer team for its senior pupils in 4th, 5th and 6th year. The soccer team's greatest success came in 2003, when, captained by Steve Dillon, they won the Leinster and All-Ireland U-17s schools cup.\n\n=== Swimming ===\n\nThe college has a strong [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] team, which combines 1st to 6th year. Currently the team has six training sessions per week. The college competes in Leinster Senior Schools and has won the senior relay cup multiple times, most recently in 2017, and the Irish senior schools, regularly making finals and achieving gold in 2017. The college has a strong record of inter-schools galas also. The school has two {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} swimming pools on the grounds. The junior school Willow Park also has a successful swimming team. The college has teams in other water sports such as [[water polo]] and 4th years participate in rowing.\n\n=== Other games===\n\n[[Table tennis]] is another one of the colleges sports with many of its students participating. Many players come from 2nd year with older years fielding less numbers. 2010 saw the Blackrock Senior A team retain the Leinster Schools Senior Cup, won for the first time in 2009, while the seniors also won the Leinster Senior League for the first time since 1968, as well as reaching the final of the Senior All Irelands for the first time. 2010 saw the junior team reach the Junior Cup final for the 3rd year in a row, however in 2008 and 2009 the Blackrock Junior A team completed the Leinster double, with victories in both Junior Cup and Junior League, and also reached the final of the Junior All Irelands in both seasons. In 2010, the Senior A team competed in the World Schools Championships for the first time. It is currently very successful at schools level, completing a 'Treble-Treble' of Leinster League, Leinster Cup and All-Ireland Championship for the past three years.\n\nThe college has its own [[basketball]] team run by teachers as well as professional coaches. Basketball has flourished when it comes to numbers and is also successful. The basketball programme produced Irish and inter provincial school boy representatives in the 1970s such as John and Noel Williams. The college has three outdoor basketball courts and different indoor basketball courts on the grounds. One indoor basketball court is in Willow Park gym, and one in the Jubilee Hall while the introduction of the new sports hall provides a professional basketball court and spectator area.\n\nThe school has a [[tennis]] team divided between minors, juniors and seniors. They practise and play their home matches on the colleges four tennis courts. 1st years in Willow Park also play on the colleges tennis teams. The college also has teams in other sports such as [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Judo]]. Cricket has been played since the foundation of the school in 1860. There has been a renaissance on the cricket pitch in the last 10 years since the building of the new sports hall which is fully equipped with 2 full sized practise lanes. This investment in cricket has helped the college to win its first Junior Cricket Trophy since 1964 and reach their first Senior Cup Final since 1961.\nOther sports such as rowing, badminton and a full athletics programme is also available to name a few.\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nBlackrock College and Willow Park share a [[cycling]] club called the Willow Wheelers, run by [[Christy McDaid]]. The club has an annual trip abroad to either France or The Netherlands each Easter, recently in Cap D'Agde. It also has hostel trips to Clare and Donegal at the end of the school year. The club has an annual {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} cycle for charity which has raised around 150,000 euro in the past few years. The club cycles every Sunday to varying destinations around Dublin.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nThe college has a very successful [[sport of athletics|athletics]] team. The college encourages participation in both track events and field events. The college also has a strong cross country team who compete regionally, with a successful history. The school organises the annual Blackrock College Invitational, inviting top athletic schools ([[CBC Monkstown]], St Gerards School, [[St Michael's College, Dublin]] and [[The King's Hospital]] to compete as a preliminary to the annual provincial and national competitions.\n\nThe athletics team participates in the East Leinster, Leinster and Ireland Athletic championships at under-14s to under-18s annually.\n\n===The arts===\n\nEach year, opera productions are staged in conjunction with [[Mount Anville Secondary School|Mount Anville]] (Senior Musical) and [[Loreto College, Foxrock|Loretto Abbey, Dalkey]] (2nd and 4th Year Musical), two nearby schools for girls.\n\n[[Debating]] is a tradition dating back to the school's founding in the 1860s. There are separate clubs for junior and senior pupils. One of the college alumni, Shane Murphy (now a Senior Counsel), won the 1985 World University Debating Championship at McGill University, representing the Honourable Society of the King's Inns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishdebate.com/universities/results/international.asp#worlds |title=Universities: Hall of Fame: International: World Universities Debating Championships |publisher=British Debate |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> The college holds gold medal debates for every academic year giving the students the opportunity to win the medal on prize day if they win the debate. The gold medal debates are used in sixth year to select an eligible Valedictorian for the year, who give his address at both the graduation mass and again at prize day. The college's debaters participate in many competitions including the L&H debates in UCD.\n\nThe college has two main choirs: the Leman and the Libermann [[choirs]]. The Leman choir has members from 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th year. The best of the senior members of the Leman choir are accepted into the Libermann choir. In 2013, a group of students from the college's Leman choir reached the final of the [[All Island Choir Competition]]. The College has a choir for boarders and another for parents. The College has a successful youth [[orchestra]]. Each year, all the choirs and the orchestra host the annual Leman Concert in the [[National Concert Hall]].\n\n===Blackrock College Radio===\n\nA transition year program to set up and maintain a [[radio]] station, broadcasting to the surrounding south Dublin area, is undertaken annually. All of the administrative work, promotion and content-creation is the labour of transition year students. The station also allows programming submissions from other schools to be broadcast. It's the only second-level radio project that broadcasts nine and a half hours a day (8:00&nbsp;am to 5:30&nbsp;pm), five days a week. The station has a mix of programmes from its current affairs programming to its guest programming. Blackrock College Radio has featured many famous and influential guests including [[Enda Kenny]], while in office as Taoiseach, Neil Flynn, [[Ryan Tubridy]], [[Eamon Gilmore]], Leo Cullen, Mary Hannifin, [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]], [[Ruairi Quinn]], [[Brent Pope (rugby analyst)|Brent Pope]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], The Heathers, [[Bobby Kerr (businessman)|Bobby Kerr]], and [[Denis O'Brien]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/1114/1194550268980.html |title=Get an earful of this |publisher=The Irish Times |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rockty.com/BCR.html Blackrock College Transition Year | BCR (Blackrock College Radio) 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020100/http://www.rockty.com/BCR.html |date=17 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bci.ie/licensing/radio/temporary_services_apps.html |title=BCI: Licensing: Radio: Successful applicants for Temporary services |publisher=Broadcasting Commission of Ireland |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402092214/http://www.bci.ie/licensing/radio/temporary_services_apps.html |archivedate=2 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Seachtain na Gaeilge===\n\nEach year a ''Seachtain na Gaeilge''  (literally, \"Week of Irish\") is organised to promote the Irish language in the school. The Irish department organises events each year to mark this occasion including [[ceili dance]], pioc fada (Longest hit) and screens Irish films. This co-curricular activity was particularly commended in a Department of Education inspection, which also recommended its further development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/report2t_60030V.htm?language=EN |title=Subject Inspection Report - Irish - 2007 |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social work==\n\nThe school donates most of its funds raised during the first term (September to October) to St Vincent De Paul and in the second and third terms the focus is mainly on Goal, Aidlink and the Willow Wheelers humanitarian projects; all of which provide international aid.\n\n===GOAL and Aidlink===\nUp until 2017, the Transition Year students organised the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] Badge appeal which raised large sums of money throughout Ireland for the Irish charities [[GOAL (charity)|GOAL]] and [[Aidlink]]. The students collected on the streets, sold the badges to overseas clients and  to businesses across the country. Goal organized a trip to India in both 2012 and 2013 to the Transition Year boys, inviting them to see the projects which they helped fund through their Badge campaigns. The trip was centred around [[Kolkata]] were Goal's Indian office was situated. The St. Patrick's Day project is estimated to have raised over \u20ac5,000,000 for charity.\n\n===St. Vincent De Paul===\n\nThe school also has a long-standing relationship with The [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], contributing large sums of money raised through various projects. For example, the proceeds of the annual sale of [[Christmas tree|Christmas Trees]] in the college are donated. In 2007, the Christmas Tree project raised \u20ac93,000 and the total amount raised for the Society in that year is estimated to be in excess of \u20ac150,000. Other projects for St Vincent De Paul include the Second and third year duck races, which raise money through sponsorship. Christmas Hampers are also packed and delivered by students and their families in the run-up to the holiday. This provides some families with the necessary supplies of food for the period.\n\n===Willow Wheelers===\n\nThe College supports humanitarian projects in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], mainly through the college's cycling club, the [http://www.willowwheelers.ie/ Willow Wheelers]. In 2006, their annual sponsored {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} cycle raised in excess of \u20ac60,000. The club also annually sends a group of self-funded volunteers to help with humanitarian projects in Africa, most commonly: establishing clean water supplies for villages and constructing schoolhouses, infirmaries or similar institutions. Transition year students who are members of the cycling club are invited to see the club's projects throughout the world, and understand how their raised funds are spent. The students usually visit [[Ethiopia]], and have visited [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Rock Reaches Out To Kenya===\nThis an initiative to build a school in Kenya to help educate the country's future leaders. The school's 6th year students have the opportunity to travel to the school every year after the leaving certificate examinations. The school is to be run by the Spiritans, who also run Blackrock College.\n\n===Past pupils' efforts===\n\n[[Bob Geldof]], initiator of the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] and [[Live Aid]] movements for famine relief in the 1980s, was a student at the college. [[Frank Duff]], the founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], the Catholic [[Laity|lay]] movement, is also a past pupil. In his memoirs, ''Straight Left: A Journey in Politics'' [[Ruairi Quinn]] cites the ethos and \"sense of solidarity\" with the Third World that was imparted to students, including Bob Geldof, as a formative force. The Holy Ghost Fathers were (and remain) an active missionary order in Africa.<ref>Quinn, Ruairi, Straight Left: A Journey in Politics, 2005, Dublin, Hodder Headline Ireland</ref> He wrote:\n\n{{quote|The poverty of distant Africa was brought into our classrooms by our returned missionary teachers.|author=[[Ruairi Quinn]]|source=''Straight Left'', pg. 36}}\n\n==Associated primary schools==\n[[Willow Park School, Dublin|Willow Park School]], a private [[primary school]] that acts as the College's principal feeder, is also run by the Order and is situated on the same campus. Until the early 1970s, [[St. Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]] in [[Ballsbridge]] was also a feeder school for Blackrock College, but St Michael's now has classes up to the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]].\n\n==Past pupils==\n\n{{Main|List of Old Rockmen}}\n\nThe Blackrock College Union represents former students of the college, organises many charitable events throughout the year, assists the school (e.g., mentoring, management assistance, advice) and organises social events for members. There are branches in Ireland and across the world.\n\nBlackrock's large enrolment and high standards have produced many distinguished alumni through its long history. Early Free State ministers such as [[Art O'Connor]] (Secretary for Agriculture 1921\u20131922), and [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], six times Taoiseach and the 3rd President of Ireland, studied and later taught in Blackrock. Modern politicians include [[Eoin O'Broin]] TD, [[Ruairi Quinn]] ( a former Minister and Leader of the Labour Party) and [[Barry Andrews (politician)|Barry Andrews]], a former junior Minister. Many prominent businessmen have also attended the school such as [[David J. O'Reilly]], chairman and former CEO of Chevron Corporation, and [[Brendan O'Regan|Dr. Brendan O'Regan]] [[CBE]], founder of [[Shannon Airport]] and proponent of the Irish peace and reconciliation process. [[Philip R. Lane]] (Governor of the Central Bank), [[Ronan Dunne]] (EVP and Group President Verizon Wireless).\n\n[[Flann O'Brien]], the eminent writer (real name: Brian O'Nolan) and [[Tim Pat Coogan]], the journalist and scholar, were students of the school. Alumni in the fine arts include designer [[Paul Costelloe]], composer [[Michael McGlynn]] and visual artist [[Robert Ballagh]]. The Holy Ghost Order has a long tradition of missionaries. [[Frank Duff (religious worker)|Frank Duff]], founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], is perhaps the best-known. Singer, songwriter, author and [[political activist]] [[Bob Geldof]] was also a student at the College. Eminent handbag designer [[Pauric Sweeney]] also calls Blackrock his alma mater. Radio and TV personality [[Ryan Tubridy]] attended the college. Singer-songwriter and producer [[Jonathon Ng]] (better known as EDEN) attended Blackrock, and in 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM a video] was posted on the college's YouTube account of Ng performing a song entitled \"Amnesia\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM|title=Amnesia - Vocal Solo - Jonathon Ng|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe college places a heavy emphasis on sport. Past pupils include Ireland internationals [[Brian O'Driscoll]] former Ireland and Lions captain, [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Victor Costello]], a 20-year Leinster, Ireland and Blackrock College RFC veteran, who also represented Ireland in shot putting at the Olympics, [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]], former captain, now coach of the [[Leinster Rugby]] team and [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], Leinster and Ireland professional rugby player.\nThe current Ireland international team includes [[Ian Madigan]],  [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]], [[Andrew Conway]] and [[Joey Carbery]],\nOther Rugby Internationals Include [[Vasily Artemyev]] (formerly of Russia), [[AJ MacGinty]] (USA) and [[Dylan Fawsitt]] (USA)\n\nIn other games, [[Michael Cusack]], founder of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] taught at the school, and played early forms of [[hurling]] with the pupils. Golfer [[John O'Leary (golfer)|John O'Leary]] (winner of the Carrolls Irish Open), [[Alan Lee (footballer)|Alan Lee]] (Ireland soccer international) and Joey O'Meara (who represented Ireland in both Hockey and Cricket), also went to Blackrock. Current Dublin footballer [[Cian O\u2019Sullivan]] and golfer [[Paul Dunne (golfer)|Paul Dunne]] attended the college.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/ Blackrock College] - official website\n\n{{Spiritan secondary schools in Ireland}}\n{{Schools and colleges in County Dublin}}\n{{Private schools in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Private schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1860]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n[[Category:Catholic boarding schools]]\n[[Category:Blackrock, Dublin]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Spiritan schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the rugby union club|Blackrock College RFC}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox school\n|type              = [[Voluntary secondary school|Voluntary]] <br /> [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school]]\n|name              = Blackrock College\n|native_name       = Col\u00e1iste na Carraige Duibhe\n|latin_name        = \n|logo              = \n|seal_image        = \n|image             = Blackrock crest.png\n|alt               = \n|caption           = \n|motto             = Fides Et Robur\n|motto_translation = Faith and Strength\n|religion          = [[Roman Catholic]] ([[Holy Ghost Fathers]])\n|location          = [[Williamstown, Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[County Dublin]]\n|country           = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|coordinates       = {{Coord|53|18|17|N|6|11|30|W|region:IE_type:edu|display=inline,title}}\n|established       = {{Start date and age|1860  }}\n|president         = Fr Cormac \u00d3 Brolch\u00e1in, [[Holy Ghost Fathers|CSSp]]\n|principal         = Alan McGinty\n|sister_school     = [[St. Mary's School, Nairobi|St. Mary's School]]\n|years             = 2nd\u20136th\n|gender            = Male\n|lower_age         = 12\n|upper_age        = 19\n|houses            = DeValera, Duff, Ebenrecht, Leman, McQuaid, Shanahan\n|students          = 1000 (200 per year)\n|staff             = 75 full time, 25 part time\n|colours           = {{color box|blue}}{{color box|white}} [[Blue]] and [[white]]\n|free_label        = Religious order\n|free_text         = [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] ([[Spiritans]])\n|free_label2       = \n|free_text2        = \u20ac6,500 (day) / \u20ac17,250 (boarding)\n|homepage          = [http://www.blackrockcollege.com blackrockcollege.com]\n}}\n\n'''Blackrock College''' ({{lang-ga|Col\u00e1iste na Carraige Duibhe}}) is a [[voluntary secondary school|voluntary]] [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school|boarding]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[secondary school]] for boys aged 13\u201318, in Williamstown, [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was founded by French missionary P\u00e9re Jules Leman [[CSSp]] in 1860 as a school and civil service training centre.\n\nThe college, {{convert|7|km|miles}} from Dublin city centre, is just in from the sea, and is self-contained, with large boarding and teaching facilities in 56 acres of rolling parkland. It accommodates approximately 1,000 day and boarding students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119060046/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nNow run by a lay foundation in trust, it maintains academic standards and requires all pupils to participate in non-academic activities, and it has a strong sporting tradition. The missionary tradition continues with charity programmes, especially at Christmas.\n\n==History==\nThe college was founded by the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]] in 1860, the first of the Order's five schools in Ireland. The founder is listed as Fr (P\u00e8re) Jules Leman, a French missionary with the Holy Ghost Order. Leman had a dual aim, namely to train personnel for missionary service in the Third World and provide a first class Catholic education for Irish boys. It was originally known as the ''French College'' by the locals. A successful [[civil service]] training and university department (where students were examined and had degrees conferred by the [[Royal University of Ireland]]) were run for over forty years, until [[University College Dublin]] grew, and the school focused more on the second level curriculum.\n\nAlthough never a seminary, some ordinations have taken place in Blackrock. The first ordination at Blackrock College was on 22 April 1900 when Mgr. Emile Allgeyer CSSp (a former student in Blackrock and first to be made a bishop), ordained [[Joseph (Ignatius) Shanahan|Joseph Shanahan]] who later became a bishop, and has a House named after him within the school.<ref>[http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html Bishop Joseph Shanahan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217113518/http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html |date=17 February 2001 }} www.spiritan.org.</ref> From 1924 until 1933 the Holy Ghost Fathers studied Theology at Blackrock Castle, before returning to Kimmage Manor.\n\nIn June 1932, college President [[John Charles McQuaid]], hosted a large garden party on the grounds of the college to welcome the papal legate, [[Lorenzo Lauri]], where the many hundreds of bishops assembled for the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]] had the opportunity to mingle with a huge gathering of distinguished guests, including President of the Executive Council, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], and others who had paid a modest subscription fee.<ref>The Church in Dublin: 1940-1965, by Roland Burke Savage, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Winter 1965</ref>\n\n===Heraldry===\nThe crest of the college is the third creation, dating back to 1936 and explained in the 1937 College Annual as being: <blockquote>The Heraldic Crest Of The College. ARGENT: - On a Cross Azure, the Dove of the Holy Ghost, Proper, with seven Rays descendant, Or. In the first quarter a Lion rampant of the second.</blockquote>\n\nOn 30 April 1926, Fr. Leen at a sports day speech encapsulated the words ''Fides Et Robur'' which henceforth became the Rock motto. In 1928, a new College Crest, bearing four emblems around a blue cross was hurriedly officiated, primarily to show off the Fides Et Robur motto over the College's especially built new front gates. Not everyone was happy with this design and possible variations of a new design may have been experimented with; evidence exists that both in crest and in uniform, by reason of fault or debate, and most likely between 1928 and 1936, a distinctive crest had been \"with nine rays descendant, Or\". In 1936, Dr. McQuaid instigated a new and distinctive crest that to this day is in continual use (unchecked variations and wayward deviations are contracted into stores by stationery and uniform suppliers). It was adapted on blazers that year and a heraldic description of the arms of the College was published (though not officially registered) in the 1937 Blackrock College Annual. It was commissioned into stained glass in 1938, presumably in its true and intended likeness and survives today at the end of one of the house corridors, though its conformity to the true heraldic interpretations are not accurate; \"a Lion Rampant of the second\" would correctly reveal only a blue silhouette of a rampant lion, that is, minus any fine caricature details so apparent in the existing variations.<ref>(Farragher, S. and Wyer, A.

The members of each house are chosen in second year by the captains, and a student remains within the same house throughout his time at the school. There are two house captains who lead each house in each year, except transition year in which there are three captains per house. They act as leaders and one from each year is chosen to represent the year on the student council. The captains are elected democratically every year by members of their house. They lead house meeting and make sure everyone in their house partakes in the school's various inter house events.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum offered is broad, covering all common subjects in the State Examinations including Latin, German, Art, Music, Business, Materials Technology Wood, Science and History.

These two buildings are connected via the central St. Patricks Corridor and the entrance corridor. Several other wings contain community facilities as well as other classrooms and subject specific rooms. The quadrangle or \"quad\" is a large green area surrounded by the senior wing, the chapel and St. Mary's Corridor. The campus is {{convert|0.25|km2|acre}} and contains nine rugby pitches, a cricket lawn, an athletics track, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, six tennis courts, basketball courts, hammer throw field and indoor halls.\n\nApart from classrooms and three study halls, there are nine science laboratories, a woodwork room, a radio studio, three computer rooms, a digital communications and graphics room, an art room, a choir hall, a multimedia room and a home economics kitchen.

The college is undergoing an extensive modernisation programme, currently the pitches are being transformed and roads around the school rerouted.\n\n==Boarding school==\nThe boarding school is housed in Williamstown Castle (known by students as \"The Castle\"). Williamstown Castle was built around 1780 on lands rented by the Fitzwilliams, later Pembrokes, to Counsellor William Vavasour.  It resembled other spacious houses in the area including Willow Park and Castledawson, but a later owner, Thomas O'Mara, extensively redeveloped the building and its surrounds, adding the castellated finish, hence making it into a 'castle'.  O'Mara had acted as an election agent for [[Daniel O'Connell]], who dined in the Castle on occasion, and for years a portrait of O'Connell adorned the room which is now the oratory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003242/http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Niall MacDermott is the Director of Boarding in the college.

The Irish department organises events each year to mark this occasion including [[ceili dance]], pioc fada (Longest hit) and screens Irish films. This co-curricular activity was particularly commended in a Department of Education inspection, which also recommended its further development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/report2t_60030V.htm?language=EN |title=Subject Inspection Report - Irish - 2007 |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social work==\n\nThe school donates most of its funds raised during the first term (September to October) to St Vincent De Paul and in the second and third terms the focus is mainly on Goal, Aidlink and the Willow Wheelers humanitarian projects; all of which provide international aid.\n\n===GOAL and Aidlink===\nUp until 2017, the Transition Year students organised the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] Badge appeal which raised large sums of money throughout Ireland for the Irish charities [[GOAL (charity)|GOAL]] and [[Aidlink]]. The students collected on the streets, sold the badges to overseas clients and  to businesses across the country. Goal organized a trip to India in both 2012 and 2013 to the Transition Year boys, inviting them to see the projects which they helped fund through their Badge campaigns. The trip was centred around [[Kolkata]] were Goal's Indian office was situated. The St. Patrick's Day project is estimated to have raised over \u20ac5,000,000 for charity.\n\n===St. Vincent De Paul===\n\nThe school also has a long-standing relationship with The [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], contributing large sums of money raised through various projects.

[[Frank Duff]], the founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], the Catholic [[Laity|lay]] movement, is also a past pupil. In his memoirs, ''Straight Left: A Journey in Politics'' [[Ruairi Quinn]] cites the ethos and \"sense of solidarity\" with the Third World that was imparted to students, including Bob Geldof, as a formative force. The Holy Ghost Fathers were (and remain) an active missionary order in Africa.<ref>Quinn, Ruairi, Straight Left: A Journey in Politics, 2005, Dublin, Hodder Headline Ireland</ref> He wrote:\n\n{{quote|The poverty of distant Africa was brought into our classrooms by our returned missionary teachers.|author=[[Ruairi Quinn]]|source=''Straight Left'', pg. 36}}\n\n==Associated primary schools==\n[[Willow Park School, Dublin|Willow Park School]], a private [[primary school]] that acts as the College's principal feeder, is also run by the Order and is situated on the same campus.
