He was also influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction also reflected his Christian beliefs, his consumption of contemporary culture, and his personal experiences, including his reaction to twentieth\u2013century warfare.\n<!--need an overview here-->\n\n==Philology==\n\nTolkien was a professional [[philologist]], a scholar of comparative and historical [[linguistics]]. He was especially familiar with [[Old English]] and related languages. Tolkien stated in a letter to his American publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 30 June 1955 that his earlier remark to the poet and ''[[The New York Times]]'' book reviewer [[Harvey Breit]] \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological.\" was meant to imply that his work was \"all of a piece, and ''fundamentally linguistic'' [sic] in inspiration. ... The [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|invention of languages]] is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.

The Noldor arrived in Middle-earth from Valinor and burned their ships, then turned to fight Melkor. Another parallel can be seen between the loss of a hand by [[Maedhros]], son of F\u00ebanor, and the similar mutilation suffered by [[Nuada]] Airgetl\u00e1m (\"Silver Hand/Arm\") during the battle with the Firbolg. Nuada received a hand made of silver to replace the lost one, and his later appellation has the same meaning as the Elvish name ''[[Celebrimbor]]'': \"silver fist\" or \"Hand of silver\" in Sindarin (''Telperinquar'' in Quenya).<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 357</ref>\n\nAnother similarity between the Silmarillion and the [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]] can be seen by comparing Nuada and [[Lugh]] (who possessed a famed magic spear, the [[Spear Luin]]) and the outcome of their confrontations with [[Balor]] of the Evil Eye and the events surrounding Celebrimbor and [[Gil-galad]], whose weapon is the spear Aeglos and their conflicts with Sauron of the Lidless Red Eye in the Second Age.<ref>[http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/a/aeglos.html Encyclopedia of Arda: Aeglos (Aiglos)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204140936/http://www.glyphweb.com/Arda/a/aeglos.html |date=4 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther authors, such as Donald O'Brien, Patrick Wynne, [[Carl Hostetter]], Tom Shippey, and [[David Day (Canadian writer)|David Day]] have pointed out similarities between the tale of [[Beren and L\u00fathien]] in ''the Silmarillion'', and [[Culhwch and Olwen]], a tale in the Welsh [[Mabinogion]]. In both, the male heroes make rash promises after having been stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Finrod]]; both show rings that prove their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, [[Twrch Trwyth]] and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf [[Carcharoth]]) with the help of a supernatural hound (Cafall and [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]). Both maidens possess such beauty that flowers grow beneath their feet when they come to meet the heroes for the first time, as if they were living embodiments of spring.<ref>Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle Earth'', pp. 193\u2013194: \"The hunting of the great wolf recalls the chase of the boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in the Welsh ''Mabinogion'', while the motif of 'the hand in the wolf's mouth' is one of the most famous parts of the ''Prose Edda'', told of [[Fenrir|Fenris Wolf]] and the god [[T\u00fdr]]; Huan recalls several faithful hounds of legend, [[Garmr|Garm]], Gelert, Cafall.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Day|2002|p=82}} \"In the Celtic tradition, when these radiant beings \u2013 these 'ladies in white' \u2013 take on mortal heroes as lovers, there are always obstacles to overcome. These obstacles usually take the form of an almost impossible [[quest]]. This is most clearly comparable to Tolkien in the Welsh legend of the wooing of Olwyn. Olwyn was the most beautiful woman of her age; her eyes shone with light, and her skin was white as snow. Olwyn's name means 'she of the white track', so bestowed because four white trefoils sprang up with her every step on the forest floor, and the winning of her hand required the near-impossible gathering of the 'Treasures of Britain'\" ... \"In Tolkien, we have two almost identical 'ladies in white': L\u00fathien in The Silmarillion, and Arwen in The Lord of the Rings\".</ref>\n\nThe Mabinogion was part of the [[Red Book of Hergest]], a source of Welsh Celtic lore, which the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], a supposed source of Hobbit-lore, probably imitates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Day|2002|p=79}}. \"When we learn that the most important source of Welsh Celtic lore was preserved in the fourteenth-century Red Book of Hergest, we realize that Tolkien is making a small scholarly joke in naming his 'source' of Elf-lore the Red Book of Westmarch\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hooker|2006|pp=176\u2013177}}, \"The Feigned-manuscript Topos\": \"The 1849 translation of The Red Book of Hergest by [[Lady Charlotte Guest]] (1812\u20131895), ...

He was also influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction also reflected his Christian beliefs, his consumption of contemporary culture, and his personal experiences, including his reaction to twentieth\u2013century warfare.\n<!--need an overview here-->\n\n==Philology==\n\nTolkien was a professional [[philologist]], a scholar of comparative and historical [[linguistics]]. He was especially familiar with [[Old English]] and related languages. Tolkien stated in a letter to his American publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 30 June 1955 that his earlier remark to the poet and ''[[The New York Times]]'' book reviewer [[Harvey Breit]] \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological.\" was meant to imply that his work was \"all of a piece, and ''fundamentally linguistic'' [sic] in inspiration. ... The [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|invention of languages]] is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.

In both, the male heroes make rash promises after having been stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Finrod]]; both show rings that prove their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, [[Twrch Trwyth]] and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf [[Carcharoth]]) with the help of a supernatural hound (Cafall and [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]).

Even [the Dark Lord] Sauron was not so\",<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> in other words all things were created good; but that the Inklings as evidenced by [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', book 2, section 2, to some extent tolerated the [[Manichean]] view that Good and Evil are equally powerful, and battle it out in the world. {{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=160-161}} Shippey writes that Tolkien's [[Ringwraith]]s embody an Inkling and Boethian idea found in Lewis and [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], that of things being bent out of shape, the word wraith suggesting \"writhe\" and \"wrath\", glossed as \"a twisted emotion\"; even the world became bent, so men could no longer sail the old straight road westwards to [[Valinor|the Undying Lands]]. All the same, Shippey writes, Tolkien's personal war experience was Manichean: evil seemed at least as powerful as good, and could easily have been victorious, a strand which can also be seen in Middle-earth.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=169-170}} At a personal level, Lewis's friendship greatly encouraged Tolkien to keep going with ''The Lord of the Rings''; he wrote that without Lewis \"I should never have brought The L. of the R. to a conclusion.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anon (Newsweek Special Edition) |title=How C.S.
