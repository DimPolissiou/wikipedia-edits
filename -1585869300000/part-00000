On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem which goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished [[high-density polyethylene]] surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so that the weight is transferred metal to plastic not metal to metal. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so that the knee has a good range of movement and is stable and aligned.

The knee is generally divided into three \"compartments\": ''medial'', ''lateral'', and ''patellofemoral''. Most people with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments, and are treated with total knee replacement (TKA). A minority of people with osteoarthritis have wear primarily in one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better postoperative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and [[blood clot]]s, but a harder revision if necessary. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis ([[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[psoriasis]]), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U4u9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=partial+knee+replacement+Persons+with+infectious+or+inflammatory+arthritis+(rheumatoid+arthritis,+lupus,+psoriasis),+or+marked+deformity+are+not+candidates+for+this+procedure#v=onepage&q=partial%20knee%20replacement%20Persons%20with%20infectious%20or%20inflammatory%20arthritis%20(rheumatoid%20arthritis,%20lupus,%20psoriasis),%20or%20marked%20deformity%20are%20not%20candidates%20for%20this%20procedure&f=false|title=Design of Artificial Human Joints & Organs|last=Pal|first=Subrata|date=2013-08-31|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6255-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Components and zones==\n{{anchor|KS zones}}[[File:Knee prosthesis zones by Knee Society 2015, lateral view.jpg|thumb|150px|KS (Knee Society) zones, lateral view.<ref name=\"MeneghiniMont2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Meneghini|first1=R.

On the tibia the component is flat, although it sometimes has a stem which goes down inside the bone for further stability. A flattened or slightly dished [[high-density polyethylene]] surface is then inserted onto the tibial component so that the weight is transferred metal to plastic not metal to metal. During the operation any deformities must be corrected, and the ligaments balanced so that the knee has a good range of movement and is stable and aligned.

The knee is generally divided into three \"compartments\": ''medial'', ''lateral'', and ''patellofemoral''. Most people with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in two or more of the above compartments, and are treated with total knee replacement (TKA). A minority of people with osteoarthritis have wear primarily in one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better postoperative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and [[blood clot]]s, but a harder revision if necessary. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis ([[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[psoriasis]]), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U4u9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=partial+knee+replacement+Persons+with+infectious+or+inflammatory+arthritis+(rheumatoid+arthritis,+lupus,+psoriasis),+or+marked+deformity+are+not+candidates+for+this+procedure#v=onepage&q=partial%20knee%20replacement%20Persons%20with%20infectious%20or%20inflammatory%20arthritis%20(rheumatoid%20arthritis,%20lupus,%20psoriasis),%20or%20marked%20deformity%20are%20not%20candidates%20for%20this%20procedure&f=false|title=Design of Artificial Human Joints & Organs|last=Pal|first=Subrata|date=2013-08-31|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6255-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Components and zones==\n{{anchor|KS zones}}[[File:Knee prosthesis zones by Knee Society 2015, lateral view.jpg|thumb|150px|KS (Knee Society) zones, lateral view.<ref name=\"MeneghiniMont2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Meneghini|first1=R.

Construction began in 1717 under King [[John V of Portugal]] and was completely concluded in 1755.\n\nThe palace was classified as a National Monument in 1910 and was also a finalist in the [[Seven Wonders of Portugal]]. On 7 July 2019, the Royal Building of Mafra \u2013 Palace, Basilica, Convent, Cerco Garden and Hunting Park ([[Tapada Nacional de Mafra|Tapada]]) was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2005/|title=Six cultural sites added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List|website=UNESCO|date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:22531-Mafra (49043847136).jpg|thumb|left|Scale model of the Royal Building of Mafra in the palace museum.]]\nThe [[palace]], which also served as a [[Franciscan]] [[friary]], was built during the reign of [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] (1707\u20131750), as consequence of a [[vow]] the king made in 1711, to build a convent if his wife, [[Maria Anna of Austria|Queen Mariana]],<ref>Born \"Maria Anna\" of Austria but known as \"Mariana\" in Portugal</ref> gave him offspring. The birth of his first daughter the [[Barbara of Portugal|Infanta Barbara of Portugal]], prompted construction of the palace to begin. The palace was conveniently located near royal hunting preserves, and was usually a secondary residence for the royal family.\n\nThis vast complex, largely built of [[Lioz]] stone, is among the most sumptuous Baroque buildings in Portugal and at 40,000 m\u00b2, one of the largest royal palaces. Designed by the German architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]], the palace was built symmetrically from a central axis, occupied by the [[basilica]], and continues lengthwise through the main [[fa\u00e7ade]] until two major towers. The structures of the convent are located behind the main fa\u00e7ade. The building also includes a major library, with about 30,000 rare books.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-0|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra|date=2015-06-18|work=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Mafra|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-0|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/biblioteca/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Biblioteca|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/biblioteca/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> The basilica is decorated with several Italian statues<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Bas\u00edlica|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> and includes six historical [[pipe organs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/orgaos/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - \u00d3rg\u00e3os|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/orgaos/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> and two [[carillon]]s, composed of 98 bells.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-history|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra, History|date=2015-06-18|work=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Mafra|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-history|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/carrilhoesmenu/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Carrilh\u00f5es|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/carrilhoesmenu/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe exact site was chosen in 1713 and purchased in 1716. Construction began by the laying of the first stone on November 17, 1717 with a grand ceremony in the presence of the king, his entire court and the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon.\n[[File:Planta do Pal\u00e1cio de Mafra.jpg|thumb|right|Floorplan of the palatial complex.]]\nInitially it was a relatively small project for a friary of 13 [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[friars]], who were to observe strict poverty. However, when the flow of [[gold]] from the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] started to arrive in [[Lisbon]] in abundance, the king changed his plans and announced the construction of a sumptuous palace<ref>The construction of the palace was so costly that it consumed virtually all of the Brazilian gold, which might otherwise have been used to benefit the general economy of Portugal.  Toby Green, ''Inquisition: The Reign of Fear'', p. 315.</ref> along with a much enlarged friary. This immense wealth allowed to king to be a generous patron of arts.\n[[File:John V of Portugal Pompeo Batoni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John V of Portugal]], constructor of the palace.]]\nHe appointed an architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]] as director of the royal works at Mafra. Ludwig had studied architecture in [[Rome]] and knew contemporary Italian art. The extent of Ludwig's responsibility is unclear, as several other architects were involved in this project: the [[Milan]]ese builder Carlos Baptista Garbo, Cust\u00f3dio Vieira, [[Manuel da Maia]] and even his own son Ant\u00f3nio. However the application of the same architectural style over the whole building suggests the work of Ludwig as the head-architect in charge of the Royal Office of Works (''Real Obra'').\n\nConstruction lasted 13 years and mobilized a vast army of workers from the entire country (a daily average of 15,000 but at the end climbing to 30,000 and a maximum of 45,000), under the command of Ant\u00f3nio Ludovice, the son of the architect.<ref> http://www.cesdies.net/monumento-de-mafra-virtual/ludovice-arquitecto-ou-capataz </ref>In addition 7,000 soldiers were assigned to preserve order at the construction site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=6381|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra|website=Monumentos|language=en|archive-url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=6381|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-13}}</ref> They used 400&nbsp;kg of gunpowder to blast through the bedrock for the laying of foundations.

The whole complex covers 37,790 m\u00b2 with about 1,200 rooms, more than 4,700 doors and windows, and 156 stairways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/museus-e-monumentos/dgpc/m/palacio-nacional-de-mafra/|title=National Palace of Mafra|website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/museus-e-monumentos/dgpc/m/palacio-nacional-de-mafra/|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/Geral/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Real Obra de Mafra|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/Geral/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\nWhen complete the building consisted of a friary capable of sheltering 330 friars, along with a royal palace and a huge library of 30,000 books, embellished with [[marble]], exotic woods and countless artworks taken from France, Flanders and Italy, which included [[The six organs in the Palace of Mafra|six monumental pipe organs]] and the two carillons.\n\nThe basilica and the convent were inaugurated on the day of the King's 41st birthday on October 22, 1730. The festivities lasted for 8 days and were of a scale never seen before in Portugal. The basilica was dedicated to Our Lady and to [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]].\n\nHowever the building was not finished. The lantern on the cupola was completed in 1735. Work continued till 1755, when the work force was needed in Lisbon by the devastations of the [[Lisbon earthquake]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra (1853).jpg|thumb|left|The palace in 1853, during the reign of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]].]]\n[[File:Mosteiro de Mafra - Gazeta CF 1169 1936 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial photograph of the palace taken in 1936.]]\nThe palace was not occupied permanently by the royalty, who considered the rooms too gloomy. Nonetheless, it was a popular destination for the members of the royal family who enjoyed hunting in the nearby game preserve, the ''[[Tapada Nacional de Mafra]]''.  During the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] the palace was inhabited for a whole year in 1807. The king was responsible for a partial renovation of the building by some well-known artists. However, with the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|French invasion]] of Portugal, in 1807, the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|royal family fled to Brazil]], taking with them some of the best pieces of art and furniture in the building. [[Marshal Junot]] took up residence in the palace, to be driven out in turn by Wellington.\n\nIn 1834, after the [[Liberal Wars]], Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] ordered the dissolution of the [[religious orders]] and the convent was abandoned by the Franciscans. During the last reigns of the [[House of Braganza]], the palace was mainly used as a base for hunting. In 1849 the monastery part of the building was assigned to the military, a situation still in use today.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe last king of Portugal, [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], following the [[5 October 1910 revolution|proclamation of the republic]], left on 5 October 1910 from the palace to the nearby coastal village of [[Ericeira]] on his way to exile. The palace was declared a national monument in 1907.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} At present, the building is [[Architectural conservation|conserved]] by the Portuguese Institute of the Architectonic Patrimony, which carried out several recovery programs, including the conservation of the main [[fa\u00e7ade]]. A major restoration of the historical pipe organs began in 1998 with the collaboration of foreign experts and was finished in 2010.<ref>http://www.palaciomafra.pt/Data/Documents/Orgaos_PM.pdf</ref> The restoration won the Europa Nostra 2012 award.<ref>http://www.snpcultura.org/restauro_seis_orgaos_basilica_mafra_distinguido_galardao_europa_nostra.html</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:2640 Mafra, Portugal - panoramio (1 cropped).jpg|thumb|center|800px|<center>Main fa\u00e7ade of the Royal Building of Mafra, designed by architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]].</center>]]\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ade===\nThe imposing fa\u00e7ade, built of local [[limestone]], is 220 m long and faces the town of Mafra. At each end of the fa\u00e7ade stands a square tower with a bulbous dome, such as found in Central Europe. The church, built in white marble,  is located in the centre of the main fa\u00e7ade, symmetrically flanked on both sides by the royal palace.\nThe king, wishing to rival the splendour of Rome, had sought architectural advice from his ambassador to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], who sent him small-scale models of important Roman religious buildings. The benedictial balcony at its centre is clearly mirrored on the balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. But this balcony is rather intended for the king, as a symbol of his power, than for the benedictions by a [[prelate]].\n\nThe two church towers (68 m high) are inspired by the towers of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (by the Roman Baroque architect [[Francesco Borromini]]). Their two [[carillon]]s contain a total of 98 church bells, founded in [[Antwerp]]. The story goes that the Flemish bell-founders were so astonished by the size of their commission, that they asked to be paid in advance. The king retorted by doubling the offered amount. These carillons constitute the largest historical collection in the world.\n\nThe two towers are connected by two rows of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns. The top row contains the statues of [[St. Dominic]] and [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], sculpted from [[Carrara]] marble, standing in a niche on each side of the balcony. The lower row contains the statues of [[St. Clara]] and   St. [[Elisabeth of Hungary]].\n\n=== Royal Palace ===\n<gallery mode=packed-hover heights=130px perrow=\"2\">\nFile:22462-Mafra (49043375123).jpg|\nFile:22480-Mafra (48303852231).jpg|\nFile:22478-Mafra (49043376603).jpg|\nFile:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (46300861054).jpg|\nFile:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (28470989227).jpg|\n</gallery>\nThe spacious royal apartments are situated on the second floor. The apartments of the king are situated at the end of the palace while the apartment of the queen is 200 m away at the other end. Such was this distance that, when the king left his apartment towards the apartment of the queen, this was announced to the queen by the sound of a trumpet.\n\nAs king John VI had taken with him some of the best pieces of art and furniture in the building when the royal family fled in 1808 for the advancing French troops to Brazil, most rooms had to be redecorated in the original style.  The  Hunting [[trophy]] room (''Sala dos Trof\u00e9us'') is decorated with numerous skulls of [[deer]], the furniture is constructed of antlers and covered with deerskin and even the candleholders are made of deer antlers.\n\nThe Benediction Gallery (''Sala da Ben\u00e7\u00e3o'') borders at the upper level of the basilica. The royal family could here attend Mass, seated at a window opening unto the basilica. The bust of John V in this hall is a work of the Italian [[Alessandro Giusti]].  The Throne Room, the Guard Room and the Room of Goddess Diana are decorated with murals by artist such as [[Ciryllo Wolkmar Machado]], [[Bernardo Oliveira G\u00f3is]] and [[Vieira Lusitano]].\n\n=== Basilica ===\n{{see also|Organ of the basilica of the Palace of Mafra}}\n{{see also|Mafra carillons}}\n{{see also|Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra}}\n[[File:22340-Mafra (49043387738).jpg|thumb|right|Principal nave of the Basilica.]] \n[[File:22313-Mafra (48303963857).jpg|thumb|left|The basilica from a palace cloister.]]\n[[File:Mafra Palace in 2012 (26).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gallery of the basilica.]]\nThe church is built in the form of a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] with a length of 63 m. It is rather narrow (16.5 m), an impression accentuated by the height of its [[nave]] (21.5 m). The vestibule (Galilee porch) contains a group of large sculptures in Carrara marble, representing the patron saints of several monastic orders.\n\nThe interior makes abundantly use of local rose-coloured [[marble]], intermingled with white marble in different patterns. The multi-coloured designs of the floor are repeated on the ceiling. The [[barrel vault]] rests on fluted Corinthian semicolumns standing between the side chapels. The chapels in the transept contain altarpieces in jasper made by sculptors from the School of Mafra. The side aisles display 58 marble statues commissioned from the best Roman sculptors of their time. The All Saint's chapel in the transept is screened from the crossing by iron railings with bronze ornaments, made in [[Antwerp]].\n\nThe choir has a magnificent giant candleholder with seven lamps sprouting from the mouth of seven rolled-up snakes. Above the main altar, inserting into the ceiling, is a gigantic jasper crucifix of 4.2 m, flanked by two kneeling angels, made by the School of Mafra.  The cupola over the crossing was also inspired by the cupola of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (by the Roman Baroque architect [[Francesco Borromini]]). This 70 m-high cupola with a small [[lantern]] atop, is carried by four finely sculpted arcs in rose and white marble.\n[[File:Cupola da Basilica do Convento de Mafra.jpg|thumb|right|Cupola of the basilica.]]\nThere are six organs, four of which are located in the transept, constituting a rather uncommon ensemble. There were built by Joaquim Peres Fontanes and Ant\u00f3nio Xavier Machado Cerveira between 1792 and 1807 (when the French troops occupied Mafra). They were made out of partially gilded Brazilian wood. The largest pipe is 6 m high and has a diameter of 0.28 m.  King John V had commissioned liturgical vestments from master [[Embroidery|embroiderer]]s from [[Genoa]] and [[Milan]], such as Giuliano Saturni and Benedetto Salandri, and from France. They attest of superb quality and workmanship by their embroidering in gold technique and the use of silk thread in the same colour.\n\nThe religious paintings in the basilica and the convent constitute one of the most significant 18th century collections in Portugal. They include works by the Italians [[Agostino Masucci]], [[Corrado Giaquinto]], [[Francesco Trevisani]], [[Pompeo Batoni]] and some Portuguese students in Rome such as [[Vieira Lusitano]] and [[In\u00e1cio de Oliveira Bernardes]].  The sculpture collection contains works by almost every major Roman sculptor from the first half of the 18th century. At that time, it represented the biggest single order done by a foreign power in Rome and still is amongst one of the biggest collections in existence.\n\nThe parish of Mafra (''Santo Andr\u00e9 de Mafra'') and the [[Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Real e Vener\u00e1vel Irmandade do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento de Mafra'') have their headquarters in the Basilica.\n\n=== Library ===\n[[File:Library of the Convent of Mafra (2).JPG|thumb|left|The palace library contains over 36,000 historic and priceless volumes.]]\n[[File:Biblioteca do Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (28827783847).jpg|thumb|right|The library of the Palace of Mafra.]]\nThe [[Rococo]] library, situated at the back of the second floor, is truly the highlight of this palace, rivalling the grandeur of the library of the [[Melk Abbey]] in Austria. Built by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa (architect)|Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], this library is 88 m long, 9.5 m wide and 13 m high. The magnificent floor is covered with tiles of rose, grey and white marble. The wooden bookshelves in Rococo style are situated on the sidewalls in two rows, separated by  a balcony with a wooden railing. They contain over 36,000 leather-bound volumes, attesting of the extent of western knowledge from the 14th to the 19th century. Among them, are many valuable bibliographical jewels, such as [[incunabulum|incunabula]]. These beautiful finished volumes were bound in the local workshop (''Livraria'') in the ''rocaille'' style (also by Manuel Caetano de Sousa).\n\nThe library is known for homing bats which protect the books from insect damage.<ref name=BostonGlobeHartnett>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/09/bats_eat_bookwo.html|title=Bats eat bookworms|accessdate=14 June 2018|author=Hartnett, Kevin|date=17 September 2013|work=Boston Globe archive website|publisher=Brainiac blog hosted by Boston Globe}}</ref>\n\nThe Library was used in [[Gulliver's Travels (TV miniseries)|''Gulliver's Travels'' (1996)]] as the Great Chamber of War for the Emperor of Lilliput.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/locations|title=Gulliver's Travels (1996\u2013 ) Filming & Production|website=IMDb|archive-url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/locations|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Convent ===\n[[File:22323-Mafra (49043386113).jpg|thumb|right|One of the numerous cloisters.]]\nThe rectangle behind the church and the palace houses the [[friary]] of the Franciscan friars of Arr\u00e1bida Order (''Ordem de S\u00e3o Francisco da Prov\u00edncia da Arr\u00e1bida'') with cells for about 300 friars in long corridors on several floors. Between 1771 and 1791 this monastery was occupied by the Hermit Friars of St. Augustine.\n\n===Mafra School of Sculpture===\n[[File:22403-Mafra (49044072432).jpg|thumb|left|Sculptures by the School of Mafra.]]\nThe Mafra School of Sculpture was founded during the reign of king [[Joseph I of Portugal]], successor of king John V. As the Mafra National Palace had a great need for sculptors, local and from abroad, it became the location of a [[sculpture]] academy headed by the Italian [[Alessandro Giusti]] (1715\u20131799).\n\nAmong the teachers were several important sculptors, such as [[Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]] (1709\u20131769), [[Claude de Laprade]] (1682\u20131738)  and [[Giovanni Antonio da Padova]] (who created most of the statues for the cathedral of [[\u00c9vora]]).\n\nThe academy was awarded many commissions by the [[Augustinian]]s from the monastery, resulting in the many marble statues and [[retable]]s in marble and [[jasper]] in the basilica.  This academy produced several generations of Portuguese sculptors, such as [[Joaquim Machado de Castro]] (1731\u20131822).\n\n==Cultural influence==\nA major reference to the construction of the palace is made in the book ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (''[[Memorial do Convento]]''), written by the Portuguese [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]].

Construction began in 1717 under King [[John V of Portugal]] and was completely concluded in 1755.\n\nThe palace was classified as a National Monument in 1910 and was also a finalist in the [[Seven Wonders of Portugal]]. On 7 July 2019, the Royal Building of Mafra \u2013 Palace, Basilica, Convent, Cerco Garden and Hunting Park ([[Tapada Nacional de Mafra|Tapada]]) was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/2005/|title=Six cultural sites added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List|website=UNESCO|date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:22531-Mafra (49043847136).jpg|thumb|left|Scale model of the Royal Building of Mafra in the palace museum.]]\nThe [[palace]], which also served as a [[Franciscan]] [[friary]], was built during the reign of [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] (1707\u20131750), as consequence of a [[vow]] the king made in 1711, to build a convent if his wife, [[Maria Anna of Austria|Queen Mariana]],<ref>Born \"Maria Anna\" of Austria but known as \"Mariana\" in Portugal</ref> gave him offspring. The birth of his first daughter the [[Barbara of Portugal|Infanta Barbara of Portugal]], prompted construction of the palace to begin. The palace was conveniently located near royal hunting preserves, and was usually a secondary residence for the royal family.\n\nThis vast complex, largely built of [[Lioz]] stone, is among the most sumptuous Baroque buildings in Portugal and at 40,000 m\u00b2, one of the largest royal palaces. Designed by the German architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]], the palace was built symmetrically from a central axis, occupied by the [[basilica]], and continues lengthwise through the main [[fa\u00e7ade]] until two major towers. The structures of the convent are located behind the main fa\u00e7ade. The building also includes a major library, with about 30,000 rare books.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-0|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra|date=2015-06-18|work=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Mafra|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-0|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/biblioteca/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Biblioteca|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/biblioteca/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> The basilica is decorated with several Italian statues<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Bas\u00edlica|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> and includes six historical [[pipe organs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/orgaos/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - \u00d3rg\u00e3os|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/orgaos/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> and two [[carillon]]s, composed of 98 bells.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-history|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra, History|date=2015-06-18|work=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Mafra|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=http://www.cm-mafra.pt/en/turismo/palacio-nacional-de-mafra-history|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/carrilhoesmenu/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Carrilh\u00f5es|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/basilicamenu/carrilhoesmenu/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe exact site was chosen in 1713 and purchased in 1716. Construction began by the laying of the first stone on November 17, 1717 with a grand ceremony in the presence of the king, his entire court and the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon.\n[[File:Planta do Pal\u00e1cio de Mafra.jpg|thumb|right|Floorplan of the palatial complex.]]\nInitially it was a relatively small project for a friary of 13 [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[friars]], who were to observe strict poverty. However, when the flow of [[gold]] from the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] started to arrive in [[Lisbon]] in abundance, the king changed his plans and announced the construction of a sumptuous palace<ref>The construction of the palace was so costly that it consumed virtually all of the Brazilian gold, which might otherwise have been used to benefit the general economy of Portugal.  Toby Green, ''Inquisition: The Reign of Fear'', p. 315.</ref> along with a much enlarged friary. This immense wealth allowed to king to be a generous patron of arts.\n[[File:John V of Portugal Pompeo Batoni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John V of Portugal]], constructor of the palace.]]\nHe appointed an architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]] as director of the royal works at Mafra. Ludwig had studied architecture in [[Rome]] and knew contemporary Italian art. The extent of Ludwig's responsibility is unclear, as several other architects were involved in this project: the [[Milan]]ese builder Carlos Baptista Garbo, Cust\u00f3dio Vieira, [[Manuel da Maia]] and even his own son Ant\u00f3nio. However the application of the same architectural style over the whole building suggests the work of Ludwig as the head-architect in charge of the Royal Office of Works (''Real Obra'').\n\nConstruction lasted 13 years and mobilized a vast army of workers from the entire country (a daily average of 15,000 but at the end climbing to 30,000 and a maximum of 45,000), under the command of Ant\u00f3nio Ludovice, the son of the architect.<ref> http://www.cesdies.net/monumento-de-mafra-virtual/ludovice-arquitecto-ou-capataz </ref>In addition 7,000 soldiers were assigned to preserve order at the construction site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=6381|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra|website=Monumentos|language=en|archive-url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=6381|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-13}}</ref> They used 400&nbsp;kg of gunpowder to blast through the bedrock for the laying of foundations.

The whole complex covers 37,790 m\u00b2 with about 1,200 rooms, more than 4,700 doors and windows, and 156 stairways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/museus-e-monumentos/dgpc/m/palacio-nacional-de-mafra/|title=National Palace of Mafra|website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/museus-e-monumentos/dgpc/m/palacio-nacional-de-mafra/|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/Geral/ContentList.aspx|title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Real Obra de Mafra|website=www.palaciomafra.gov.pt|language=pt|archive-url=http://www.palaciomafra.gov.pt/pt-PT/Geral/ContentList.aspx|archive-date=2018-04-09|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\nWhen complete the building consisted of a friary capable of sheltering 330 friars, along with a royal palace and a huge library of 30,000 books, embellished with [[marble]], exotic woods and countless artworks taken from France, Flanders and Italy, which included [[The six organs in the Palace of Mafra|six monumental pipe organs]] and the two carillons.\n\nThe basilica and the convent were inaugurated on the day of the King's 41st birthday on October 22, 1730. The festivities lasted for 8 days and were of a scale never seen before in Portugal. The basilica was dedicated to Our Lady and to [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]].\n\nHowever the building was not finished. The lantern on the cupola was completed in 1735. Work continued till 1755, when the work force was needed in Lisbon by the devastations of the [[Lisbon earthquake]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra (1853).jpg|thumb|left|The palace in 1853, during the reign of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]].]]\n[[File:Mosteiro de Mafra - Gazeta CF 1169 1936 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial photograph of the palace taken in 1936.]]\nThe palace was not occupied permanently by the royalty, who considered the rooms too gloomy. Nonetheless, it was a popular destination for the members of the royal family who enjoyed hunting in the nearby game preserve, the ''[[Tapada Nacional de Mafra]]''.  During the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] the palace was inhabited for a whole year in 1807. The king was responsible for a partial renovation of the building by some well-known artists. However, with the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|French invasion]] of Portugal, in 1807, the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|royal family fled to Brazil]], taking with them some of the best pieces of art and furniture in the building. [[Marshal Junot]] took up residence in the palace, to be driven out in turn by Wellington.\n\nIn 1834, after the [[Liberal Wars]], Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] ordered the dissolution of the [[religious orders]] and the convent was abandoned by the Franciscans. During the last reigns of the [[House of Braganza]], the palace was mainly used as a base for hunting. In 1849 the monastery part of the building was assigned to the military, a situation still in use today.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe last king of Portugal, [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], following the [[5 October 1910 revolution|proclamation of the republic]], left on 5 October 1910 from the palace to the nearby coastal village of [[Ericeira]] on his way to exile. The palace was declared a national monument in 1907.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} At present, the building is [[Architectural conservation|conserved]] by the Portuguese Institute of the Architectonic Patrimony, which carried out several recovery programs, including the conservation of the main [[fa\u00e7ade]]. A major restoration of the historical pipe organs began in 1998 with the collaboration of foreign experts and was finished in 2010.<ref>http://www.palaciomafra.pt/Data/Documents/Orgaos_PM.pdf</ref> The restoration won the Europa Nostra 2012 award.<ref>http://www.snpcultura.org/restauro_seis_orgaos_basilica_mafra_distinguido_galardao_europa_nostra.html</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:2640 Mafra, Portugal - panoramio (1 cropped).jpg|thumb|center|800px|<center>Main fa\u00e7ade of the Royal Building of Mafra, designed by architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]].</center>]]\n\n=== Fa\u00e7ade===\nThe imposing fa\u00e7ade, built of local [[limestone]], is 220 m long and faces the town of Mafra. At each end of the fa\u00e7ade stands a square tower with a bulbous dome, such as found in Central Europe. The church, built in white marble,  is located in the centre of the main fa\u00e7ade, symmetrically flanked on both sides by the royal palace.\nThe king, wishing to rival the splendour of Rome, had sought architectural advice from his ambassador to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], who sent him small-scale models of important Roman religious buildings. The benedictial balcony at its centre is clearly mirrored on the balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. But this balcony is rather intended for the king, as a symbol of his power, than for the benedictions by a [[prelate]].\n\nThe two church towers (68 m high) are inspired by the towers of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (by the Roman Baroque architect [[Francesco Borromini]]). Their two [[carillon]]s contain a total of 92 church bells, founded in [[Antwerp]]. The story goes that the Flemish bell-founders were so astonished by the size of their commission, that they asked to be paid in advance. The king retorted by doubling the offered amount. These carillons constitute the largest historical collection in the world.\n\nThe two towers are connected by two rows of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns. The top row contains the statues of [[St. Dominic]] and [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], sculpted from [[Carrara]] marble, standing in a niche on each side of the balcony. The lower row contains the statues of [[St. Clara]] and   St. [[Elisabeth of Hungary]].\n\n=== Royal Palace ===\n<gallery mode=packed-hover heights=130px perrow=\"2\">\nFile:22462-Mafra (49043375123).jpg|\nFile:22480-Mafra (48303852231).jpg|\nFile:22478-Mafra (49043376603).jpg|\nFile:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (46300861054).jpg|\nFile:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (28470989227).jpg|\n</gallery>\nThe spacious royal apartments are situated on the second floor. The apartments of the king are situated at the end of the palace while the apartment of the queen is 200 m away at the other end. Such was this distance that, when the king left his apartment towards the apartment of the queen, this was announced to the queen by the sound of a trumpet.\n\nAs king John VI had taken with him some of the best pieces of art and furniture in the building when the royal family fled in 1808 for the advancing French troops to Brazil, most rooms had to be redecorated in the original style.  The  Hunting [[trophy]] room (''Sala dos Trof\u00e9us'') is decorated with numerous skulls of [[deer]], the furniture is constructed of antlers and covered with deerskin and even the candleholders are made of deer antlers.\n\nThe Benediction Gallery (''Sala da Ben\u00e7\u00e3o'') borders at the upper level of the basilica. The royal family could here attend Mass, seated at a window opening unto the basilica. The bust of John V in this hall is a work of the Italian [[Alessandro Giusti]].  The Throne Room, the Guard Room and the Room of Goddess Diana are decorated with murals by artist such as [[Ciryllo Wolkmar Machado]], [[Bernardo Oliveira G\u00f3is]] and [[Vieira Lusitano]].\n\n=== Basilica ===\n{{see also|Organ of the basilica of the Palace of Mafra}}\n{{see also|Mafra carillons}}\n{{see also|Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra}}\n[[File:22340-Mafra (49043387738).jpg|thumb|right|Principal nave of the Basilica.]] \n[[File:22313-Mafra (48303963857).jpg|thumb|left|The basilica from a palace cloister.]]\n[[File:Mafra Palace in 2012 (26).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gallery of the basilica.]]\nThe church is built in the form of a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] with a length of 63 m. It is rather narrow (16.5 m), an impression accentuated by the height of its [[nave]] (21.5 m). The vestibule (Galilee porch) contains a group of large sculptures in Carrara marble, representing the patron saints of several monastic orders.\n\nThe interior makes abundantly use of local rose-coloured [[marble]], intermingled with white marble in different patterns. The multi-coloured designs of the floor are repeated on the ceiling. The [[barrel vault]] rests on fluted Corinthian semicolumns standing between the side chapels. The chapels in the transept contain altarpieces in jasper made by sculptors from the School of Mafra. The side aisles display 58 marble statues commissioned from the best Roman sculptors of their time. The All Saint's chapel in the transept is screened from the crossing by iron railings with bronze ornaments, made in [[Antwerp]].\n\nThe choir has a magnificent giant candleholder with seven lamps sprouting from the mouth of seven rolled-up snakes. Above the main altar, inserting into the ceiling, is a gigantic jasper crucifix of 4.2 m, flanked by two kneeling angels, made by the School of Mafra.  The cupola over the crossing was also inspired by the cupola of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (by the Roman Baroque architect [[Francesco Borromini]]). This 70 m-high cupola with a small [[lantern]] atop, is carried by four finely sculpted arcs in rose and white marble.\n[[File:Cupola da Basilica do Convento de Mafra.jpg|thumb|right|Cupola of the basilica.]]\nThere are six organs, four of which are located in the transept, constituting a rather uncommon ensemble. There were built by Joaquim Peres Fontanes and Ant\u00f3nio Xavier Machado Cerveira between 1792 and 1807 (when the French troops occupied Mafra). They were made out of partially gilded Brazilian wood. The largest pipe is 6 m high and has a diameter of 0.28 m.  King John V had commissioned liturgical vestments from master [[Embroidery|embroiderer]]s from [[Genoa]] and [[Milan]], such as Giuliano Saturni and Benedetto Salandri, and from France. They attest of superb quality and workmanship by their embroidering in gold technique and the use of silk thread in the same colour.\n\nThe religious paintings in the basilica and the convent constitute one of the most significant 18th century collections in Portugal. They include works by the Italians [[Agostino Masucci]], [[Corrado Giaquinto]], [[Francesco Trevisani]], [[Pompeo Batoni]] and some Portuguese students in Rome such as [[Vieira Lusitano]] and [[In\u00e1cio de Oliveira Bernardes]].  The sculpture collection contains works by almost every major Roman sculptor from the first half of the 18th century. At that time, it represented the biggest single order done by a foreign power in Rome and still is amongst one of the biggest collections in existence.\n\nThe parish of Mafra (''Santo Andr\u00e9 de Mafra'') and the [[Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Real e Vener\u00e1vel Irmandade do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento de Mafra'') have their headquarters in the Basilica.\n\n=== Library ===\n[[File:Library of the Convent of Mafra (2).JPG|thumb|left|The palace library contains over 36,000 historic and priceless volumes.]]\n[[File:Biblioteca do Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra - Portugal (28827783847).jpg|thumb|right|The library of the Palace of Mafra.]]\nThe [[Rococo]] library, situated at the back of the second floor, is truly the highlight of this palace, rivalling the grandeur of the library of the [[Melk Abbey]] in Austria. Built by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa (architect)|Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], this library is 88 m long, 9.5 m wide and 13 m high. The magnificent floor is covered with tiles of rose, grey and white marble. The wooden bookshelves in Rococo style are situated on the sidewalls in two rows, separated by  a balcony with a wooden railing. They contain over 36,000 leather-bound volumes, attesting of the extent of western knowledge from the 14th to the 19th century. Among them, are many valuable bibliographical jewels, such as [[incunabulum|incunabula]]. These beautiful finished volumes were bound in the local workshop (''Livraria'') in the ''rocaille'' style (also by Manuel Caetano de Sousa).\n\nThe library is known for homing bats which protect the books from insect damage.<ref name=BostonGlobeHartnett>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/09/bats_eat_bookwo.html|title=Bats eat bookworms|accessdate=14 June 2018|author=Hartnett, Kevin|date=17 September 2013|work=Boston Globe archive website|publisher=Brainiac blog hosted by Boston Globe}}</ref>\n\nThe Library was used in [[Gulliver's Travels (TV miniseries)|''Gulliver's Travels'' (1996)]] as the Great Chamber of War for the Emperor of Lilliput.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/locations|title=Gulliver's Travels (1996\u2013 ) Filming & Production|website=IMDb|archive-url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/locations|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=|access-date=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Convent ===\n[[File:22323-Mafra (49043386113).jpg|thumb|right|One of the numerous cloisters.]]\nThe rectangle behind the church and the palace houses the [[friary]] of the Franciscan friars of Arr\u00e1bida Order (''Ordem de S\u00e3o Francisco da Prov\u00edncia da Arr\u00e1bida'') with cells for about 300 friars in long corridors on several floors. Between 1771 and 1791 this monastery was occupied by the Hermit Friars of St. Augustine.\n\n===Mafra School of Sculpture===\n[[File:22403-Mafra (49044072432).jpg|thumb|left|Sculptures by the School of Mafra.]]\nThe Mafra School of Sculpture was founded during the reign of king [[Joseph I of Portugal]], successor of king John V. As the Mafra National Palace had a great need for sculptors, local and from abroad, it became the location of a [[sculpture]] academy headed by the Italian [[Alessandro Giusti]] (1715\u20131799).\n\nAmong the teachers were several important sculptors, such as [[Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]] (1709\u20131769), [[Claude de Laprade]] (1682\u20131738)  and [[Giovanni Antonio da Padova]] (who created most of the statues for the cathedral of [[\u00c9vora]]).\n\nThe academy was awarded many commissions by the [[Augustinian]]s from the monastery, resulting in the many marble statues and [[retable]]s in marble and [[jasper]] in the basilica.  This academy produced several generations of Portuguese sculptors, such as [[Joaquim Machado de Castro]] (1731\u20131822).\n\n==Cultural influence==\nA major reference to the construction of the palace is made in the book ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (''[[Memorial do Convento]]''), written by the Portuguese [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]. The main character, Baltasar, born in Mafra,<ref>https://www.cm-mafra.pt/pages/1148?event_id=822</ref> works in the construction of the palace(He does not work in the construction of the palace. He was born in Mafra and during the events of the novel he returns to it and witnesses some of the early stages of the construction before leaving again to Lisbon).

The red line marks the first arrival of P-waves; the green line, the later arrival of S-waves. |alt=Three lines with frequent vertical excursions.]]\nSeismic waves are [[elastic waves]] that propagate in solid or fluid materials.  They can be divided into ''body waves'' that travel through the interior of the materials; ''surface waves'' that travel along surfaces or interfaces between materials; and ''normal modes'', a form of standing wave.\n\n===Body waves===\n\nThere are two types of body waves, pressure waves or primary waves (P-waves) and [[Shearing (physics)|shear]] or secondary waves ([[S-wave]]s). P-waves are [[longitudinal wave]]s that involve [[Compression (geology)|compression]] and [[rarefaction|expansion]] in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids. [[S-waves]] are [[transverse wave]]s that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than P-waves. Therefore, they appear later than P-waves on a seismogram. Fluids cannot support perpendicular motion, so S-waves only travel in solids.<ref name=Gubbins1990>{{harvnb|Gubbins|1990}}</ref>\n\n===Surface waves===\nSurface waves are the result of P- and S-waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. These waves are [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]], meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are [[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh waves]], which have both compressional and shear motions, and [[Love wave]]s, which are purely shear. Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves with the surface and can exist in any solid medium. Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earth's surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves (1/distance<sup>2</sup> vs. 1/distance<sup>3</sup>), and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves. The primary surface waves are often the largest signals on earthquake seismograms. Surface waves are strongly excited when their source is close to the surface, as in a shallow earthquake or a near surface explosion, and are much weaker for deep earthquake sources.<ref name=Gubbins1990/>\n\n===Normal modes===\n{{See also|seismic wave#Free oscillations of the Earth|label 1=Free oscillations of the Earth}}\nBoth body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth \"ring\" like a resonant bell. This ringing is a mixture of  [[normal modes]] with discrete frequencies and periods of an hour or shorter.  Motion caused by a large earthquake can be observed for up to a month after the event.<ref name=Gubbins1990/> The first observations of normal modes were made in the 1960s as the advent of higher fidelity instruments coincided with two of the largest earthquakes of the 20th century \u2013 the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] and the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]].  Since then, the normal modes of the Earth have given us some of the strongest constraints on the deep structure of the Earth.\n\n==Earthquakes==\n{{Main|Earthquake|Lists of earthquakes}}\nOne of the first attempts at the scientific study of earthquakes followed the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  Other notable earthquakes that spurred major advancements in the science of seismology include the [[1857 Basilicata earthquake]], the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the 2004 [[Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]], and the 2011 [[Tohoku earthquake|Great East Japan earthquake]].\n\n==Controlled seismic sources==\n{{See also|Reflection seismology}}\nSeismic waves produced by [[explosion]]s or vibrating controlled sources are one of the primary methods of [[Exploration geophysics|underground exploration in geophysics]] (in addition to many different [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] methods such as [[induced polarization]] and [[magnetotellurics]]).  Controlled-source seismology has been used to map [[salt dome]]s, anticlines and other geologic traps in [[petroleum]]-bearing [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Fault (geology)|faults]], rock types, and long-buried giant [[meteor]] [[Impact crater|craters]]. For example, the [[Chicxulub Crater]],  which was caused by an impact that has been [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|implicated in the extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s, was localized to Central America by analyzing ejecta in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], and then physically proven to exist using seismic maps from [[oil exploration]].<ref name=Schulte2010>{{harvnb|Schulte et al.|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Detection of seismic waves==\n[[File:Seismometer-iceland.JPG|thumb|Installation for a temporary seismic station, north Iceland highland.]]\n[[Seismometer]]s are sensors that detect and record the motion of the Earth arising from elastic waves.  Seismometers may be deployed at the Earth's surface, in shallow vaults, in boreholes, or [[Ocean-bottom seismometer|underwater]].  A complete instrument package that records seismic signals is called a [[seismograph]].  Networks of seismographs continuously record ground motions around the world to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of global earthquakes and other sources of seismic activity. Rapid location of earthquakes makes [[tsunami]] warnings possible because seismic waves travel considerably faster than tsunami waves. Seismometers also record signals from non-earthquake sources ranging from explosions (nuclear and chemical), to local noise from wind<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/2015JB012478|title = Wind-induced ground motion| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth| volume=121| issue=2| pages=917\u2013930|year = 2016|last1 = Naderyan|first1 = Vahid| last2=Hickey| first2=Craig J.| last3=Raspet| first3=Richard}}</ref> or anthropogenic activities, to incessant signals generated at the ocean floor and coasts induced by ocean waves (the global [[microseism]]), to [[cryosphere|cryospheric]] events associated with large icebergs and glaciers. Above-ocean meteor strikes with energies as high as 4.2 &times; 10<SUP>13</SUP> [[joule|J]] (equivalent to that released by an explosion of ten kilotons of TNT) have been recorded by seismographs, as have a number of industrial accidents and terrorist bombs and events (a field of study referred to as [[forensic seismology]]).  A major long-term motivation for the global seismographic monitoring has been for the detection and study of [[nuclear testing]].\n\n==Mapping the earth's interior==\n{{Main|Earth's interior}}\n[[Image:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|280px|Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [[Earth]] sampled by seismic waves |alt=Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths]]\nBecause seismic waves commonly propagate efficiently as they interact with the internal structure of the Earth, they provide high-resolution noninvasive methods for studying the planet's interior.  One of the earliest important discoveries (suggested by Richard Dixon Oldham in 1906 and definitively shown by Harold Jeffreys in 1926) was that the [[outer core]] of the earth is liquid.  Since S-waves do not pass through liquids, the liquid core causes a \"shadow\" on the side of the planet opposite the earthquake where no direct S-waves are observed.  In addition, P-waves travel much slower through the outer core than the mantle.\n\nProcessing readings from many seismometers using [[seismic tomography]], seismologists have mapped the mantle of the earth to a resolution of several hundred kilometers.  This has enabled scientists to identify [[convection cell]]s and other large-scale features such as the [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]] near the [[core\u2013mantle boundary]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wen|Helmberger|1998}}</ref>\n\n==Seismology and society==\n\n===Earthquake prediction===\n{{main|Earthquake prediction}}\nForecasting a probable timing, location, magnitude and other important features of a forthcoming seismic event is called [[earthquake prediction]]. Various attempts have been made by seismologists and others to create effective systems for precise earthquake predictions, including the [[VAN method]].  Most seismologists do not believe that a system to provide timely warnings for individual earthquakes has yet been developed, and many believe that such a system would be unlikely to give useful warning of impending seismic events. However, more general forecasts routinely predict [[seismic hazard]]. Such forecasts estimate the probability of an earthquake of a particular size affecting a particular location within a particular time-span, and they are routinely used in [[earthquake engineering]].\n\nPublic controversy over earthquake prediction erupted after Italian authorities [[indicted]] six seismologists and one government official for [[manslaughter]] in connection with [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on April 5, 2009]]. The indictment has been widely perceived{{by whom|date=October 2011}} as an indictment for failing to predict the earthquake and has drawn condemnation from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The indictment claims that, at a special meeting in L'Aquila the week before the earthquake occurred, scientists and officials were more interested in pacifying the population than providing adequate information about earthquake risk and preparedness.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Engineering seismology ===\nEngineering seismology is the study and application of seismology for engineering purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopaedia of Geology|chapter-url = |publisher = Elsevier|date = 2005-01-01|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-12-369396-9|pages = 499\u2013515|doi = 10.1016/b0-12-369396-9/90020-0|editor-first = Richard C.

The red line marks the first arrival of P-waves; the green line, the later arrival of S-waves. |alt=Three lines with frequent vertical excursions.]]\nSeismic waves are [[elastic waves]] that propagate in solid or fluid materials.  They can be divided into ''body waves'' that travel through the interior of the materials; ''surface waves'' that travel along surfaces or interfaces between materials; and ''normal modes'', a form of standing wave.\n\n===Body waves===\n\nThere are two types of body waves, pressure waves or primary waves (P-waves) and [[Shearing (physics)|shear]] or secondary waves ([[S-wave]]s). P-waves are [[longitudinal wave]]s that involve [[Compression (geology)|compression]] and [[rarefaction|expansion]] in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids. [[S-waves]] are [[transverse wave]]s that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than P-waves. Therefore, they appear later than P-waves on a seismogram. Fluids cannot support perpendicular motion, so S-waves only travel in solids.<ref name=Gubbins1990>{{harvnb|Gubbins|1990}}</ref>\n\n===Surface waves===\nSurface waves are the result of P- and S-waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. These waves are [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]], meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are [[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh waves]], which have both compressional and shear motions, and [[Love wave]]s, which are purely shear. Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves with the surface and can exist in any solid medium. Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earth's surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves (1/distance<sup>2</sup> vs. 1/distance<sup>3</sup>), and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves. The primary surface waves are often the largest signals on earthquake seismograms. Surface waves are strongly excited when their source is close to the surface, as in a shallow earthquake or a near surface explosion, and are much weaker for deep earthquake sources.<ref name=Gubbins1990/>\n\n===Normal modes===\n{{See also|seismic wave#Free oscillations of the Earth|label 1=Free oscillations of the Earth}}\nBoth body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth \"ring\" like a resonant bell. This ringing is a mixture of  [[normal modes]] with discrete frequencies and periods of an hour or shorter.  Motion caused by a large earthquake can be observed for up to a month after the event.<ref name=Gubbins1990/> The first observations of normal modes were made in the 1960s as the advent of higher fidelity instruments coincided with two of the largest earthquakes of the 20th century \u2013 the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] and the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]].  Since then, the normal modes of the Earth have given us some of the strongest constraints on the deep structure of the Earth.\n\n==Earthquakes==\n{{Main|Earthquake|Lists of earthquakes}}\nOne of the first attempts at the scientific study of earthquakes followed the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  Other notable earthquakes that spurred major advancements in the science of seismology include the [[1857 Basilicata earthquake]], the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the 2004 [[Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]], and the 2011 [[Tohoku earthquake|Great East Japan earthquake]].\n\n==Controlled seismic sources==\n{{See also|Reflection seismology}}\nSeismic waves produced by [[explosion]]s or vibrating controlled sources are one of the primary methods of [[Exploration geophysics|underground exploration in geophysics]] (in addition to many different [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] methods such as [[induced polarization]] and [[magnetotellurics]]).  Controlled-source seismology has been used to map [[salt dome]]s, anticlines and other geologic traps in [[petroleum]]-bearing [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Fault (geology)|faults]], rock types, and long-buried giant [[meteor]] [[Impact crater|craters]]. For example, the [[Chicxulub Crater]],  which was caused by an impact that has been [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|implicated in the extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s, was localized to Central America by analyzing ejecta in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], and then physically proven to exist using seismic maps from [[oil exploration]].<ref name=Schulte2010>{{harvnb|Schulte et al.|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Detection of seismic waves==\n[[File:Seismometer-iceland.JPG|thumb|Installation for a temporary seismic station, north Iceland highland.]]\n[[Seismometer]]s are sensors that detect and record the motion of the Earth arising from elastic waves.  Seismometers may be deployed at the Earth's surface, in shallow vaults, in boreholes, or [[Ocean-bottom seismometer|underwater]].  A complete instrument package that records seismic signals is called a [[seismograph]].  Networks of seismographs continuously record ground motions around the world to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of global earthquakes and other sources of seismic activity. Rapid location of earthquakes makes [[tsunami]] warnings possible because seismic waves travel considerably faster than tsunami waves. Seismometers also record signals from non-earthquake sources ranging from explosions (nuclear and chemical), to local noise from wind<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/2015JB012478|title = Wind-induced ground motion| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth| volume=121| issue=2| pages=917\u2013930|year = 2016|last1 = Naderyan|first1 = Vahid| last2=Hickey| first2=Craig J.| last3=Raspet| first3=Richard}}</ref> or anthropogenic activities, to incessant signals generated at the ocean floor and coasts induced by ocean waves (the global [[microseism]]), to [[cryosphere|cryospheric]] events associated with large icebergs and glaciers. Above-ocean meteor strikes with energies as high as 4.2 &times; 10<SUP>13</SUP> [[joule|J]] (equivalent to that released by an explosion of ten kilotons of TNT) have been recorded by seismographs, as have a number of industrial accidents and terrorist bombs and events (a field of study referred to as [[forensic seismology]]).  A major long-term motivation for the global seismographic monitoring has been for the detection and study of [[nuclear testing]].\n\n==Mapping the earth's interior==\n{{Main|Earth's interior}}\n[[Image:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|280px|Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [[Earth]] sampled by seismic waves |alt=Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths]]\nBecause seismic waves commonly propagate efficiently as they interact with the internal structure of the Earth, they provide high-resolution noninvasive methods for studying the planet's interior.  One of the earliest important discoveries (suggested by Richard Dixon Oldham in 1906 and definitively shown by Harold Jeffreys in 1926) was that the [[outer core]] of the earth is liquid.  Since S-waves do not pass through liquids, the liquid core causes a \"shadow\" on the side of the planet opposite the earthquake where no direct S-waves are observed.  In addition, P-waves travel much slower through the outer core than the mantle.\n\nProcessing readings from many seismometers using [[seismic tomography]], seismologists have mapped the mantle of the earth to a resolution of several hundred kilometers.  This has enabled scientists to identify [[convection cell]]s and other large-scale features such as the [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]] near the [[core\u2013mantle boundary]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wen|Helmberger|1998}}</ref>\n\n==Seismology and society==\n\n===Earthquake prediction===\n{{main|Earthquake prediction}}\nForecasting a probable timing, location, magnitude and other important features of a forthcoming seismic event is called [[earthquake prediction]]. Various attempts have been made by seismologists and others to create effective systems for precise earthquake predictions, including the [[VAN method]].  Most seismologists do not believe that a system to provide timely warnings for individual earthquakes has yet been developed, and many believe that such a system would be unlikely to give useful warning of impending seismic events. However, more general forecasts routinely predict [[seismic hazard]]. Such forecasts estimate the probability of an earthquake of a particular size affecting a particular location within a particular time-span, and they are routinely used in [[earthquake engineering]].\n\nPublic controversy over earthquake prediction erupted after Italian authorities [[indicted]] six seismologists and one government official for [[manslaughter]] in connection with [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on April 5, 2009]]. The indictment has been widely perceived{{by whom|date=October 2011}} as an indictment for failing to predict the earthquake and has drawn condemnation from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The indictment claims that, at a special meeting in L'Aquila the week before the earthquake occurred, scientists and officials were more interested in pacifying the population than providing adequate information about earthquake risk and preparedness.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Engineering seismology ===\nEngineering seismology is the study and application of seismology for engineering purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopaedia of Geology|chapter-url = |publisher = Elsevier|date = 2005-01-01|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-12-369396-9|pages = 499\u2013515|doi = 10.1016/b0-12-369396-9/90020-0|editor-first = Richard C.

While in [[Europe]] he was introduced to the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning Spanish in colonial South America. Taking advantage of the disorder in Spain prompted by the [[Peninsular War]], Bol\u00edvar began his [[Spanish American wars of independence|campaign for independence]] in 1808.<ref name=LITofPROP>{{cite book|last1=ed|first1=Thomas Riggs|title=The literature of propaganda.|date=2013|publisher=St. James Press|location=Detroit [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-55862-859-5|pages=153\u201355}}</ref> The campaign for the independence of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] was consolidated with the victory at the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]] on 7 August 1819. He established an organized national congress within three years. Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the patriot victory at the [[Battle of Carabobo]] in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country.\n\nFollowing this triumph over the [[Spanish monarchy]], Bol\u00edvar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Latin America, [[Gran Colombia]], of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Through further military campaigns, he ousted Spanish rulers from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the last of which was named after him. He was simultaneously president of Gran Colombia (present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador), Peru, and Bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], was appointed president of Bolivia. Bol\u00edvar aimed at a strong and united Spanish America able to cope not only with the threats emanating from Spain and the European [[Holy Alliance]] but also with the emerging power of the [[United States]]. At the peak of his power, Bol\u00edvar ruled over a vast territory from the [[Argentina|Argentine]] border to the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nBol\u00edvar fought 472 battles, of which 79 were important ones, and during his campaigns rode on horseback 123,000 kilometers, which is 10 times more than [[Hannibal]], three times more than Napoleon, and twice as much as Alexander the Great.<ref>Toro Hardy, Alfredo, ''Understanding Latin America'' (2017), World Scientific, New Jersey, p. 47</ref> Bol\u00edvar is viewed as a [[Father of the Nation|national icon]] in much of modern South America, and is considered one of the great heroes of the [[Hispanic]] independence movements of the early 19th century, along with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], [[Francisco de Miranda]] and others.

Bol\u00edvar's first South American ancestor was Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar (or Simon de Bolibar; the [[Spanish orthography|spelling]] was not standardized until the 19th century), who lived and worked in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]) from 1559 to 1560 and where his son Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar y Castro was born. When the governor was reassigned to Venezuela by the Spanish Crown in 1569, Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar went with him. As an early settler in Spain's [[Venezuela Province]], he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted [[Plantation|estates]], [[encomienda]]s, and positions in the local [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]].{{sfn|Slatta|de Grummond|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEWHt-o8IdkC&pg=PA10 10\u201311]}}\n\nWhen [[Caracas Cathedral]] was built in 1569, the Bol\u00edvar family had one of the first dedicated side chapels. The majority of the wealth of Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar's descendants came from the estates. The most important was a sugar [[plantation]] with an [[encomienda]] that provided the labor needed to run the estate.{{sfn|Masur|1969|pp=21\u201322}} Another portion of the Bol\u00edvars' wealth came from [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]] mines. Small gold deposits were first mined in Venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits. From his mother's side (the Palacios family), Bol\u00edvar inherited the [[Aroa copper mines]] at [[Yaracuy|Cocorote]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African diaspora|African]] slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines.{{sfn|Thornton|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&pg=PA277 277]}}\n\n===17th century===\nToward the end of the 17th century, copper mining became so prominent in Venezuela that the metal became known as ''cobre Caracas'' (\"Caracas copper\"). Many of the mines became the property of the Bol\u00edvar family. Bol\u00edvar's grandfather, Juan de Bol\u00edvar y Mart\u00ednez de Villegas, paid 22,000 [[ducat]]s to the monastery at [[Santa Maria de Montserrat]] in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by King [[Philip V of Spain]] for its maintenance. The crown never issued the [[Letters patent|patent of nobility]], and so the purchase became the subject of [[lawsuit]]s that were still in progress during Bol\u00edvar's lifetime, when independence from Spain made the point moot. (If the lawsuits had been successful, Bol\u00edvar's older brother, Juan Vicente, would have become the [[Marquess]] of [[Villa de Cura|San Luis]] and [[Viscount]] of Cocorote.) Bol\u00edvar ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution.

A couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life. His father died before Bol\u00edvar's third birthday to tuberculosis,{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=9}} and his mother died when he was almost nine.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Bol\u00edvar was placed in the custody of an instructor, Miguel Jos\u00e9 Sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home. He went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]], Guillermo Pelgr\u00f3n, Jose Antonio Negrete, Fernando Vides, Father And\u00fajar, and Don [[Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], formerly known as Sim\u00f3n Carre\u00f1o. Don Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez became Bol\u00edvar's teacher, friend and mentor.

Back in Europe in 1804, he lived in France and traveled to different countries. While in [[Milan]], Bol\u00edvar witnessed the coronation of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] as King of Italy (a kingdom in personal union with France in northern modern Italy), an event that left a profound impression on him.

After a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] on 19 April 1810, Venezuela achieved ''de facto'' independence when the [[Supreme Junta|Supreme Junta of Caracas]] was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Supreme Junta sent a delegation to [[Great Britain]] to get British recognition and aid. This delegation presided by Bol\u00edvar also included two future Venezuelan notables [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]] and Luis L\u00f3pez M\u00e9ndez. The trio met with [[Francisco de Miranda]] and persuaded him to return to his native land.\n\n====First Republic of Venezuela, 1811\u20131812====\nIn 1811, a delegation from the Supreme Junta, also including Bol\u00edvar, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received Miranda in [[La Guaira]].<ref>Crow (1992:431).</ref>  During the insurgence war conducted by Miranda, Bol\u00edvar was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year, 1812. As [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalist]] Frigate Captain [[Domingo de Monteverde]] was advancing into republican territory from the west, Bol\u00edvar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Bol\u00edvar then retreated to his estate in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]].\n\nMiranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with Monteverde on 25 July, an action that Bol\u00edvar and other revolutionary officers deemed [[treason]]ous. In one of Bol\u00edvar's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army at the port of La Guaira.<ref>Masur (1969), 98\u2013102; and Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 60\u201363.</ref> For his apparent services to the Royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol\u00edvar a passport, and Bol\u00edvar left for [[Cura\u00e7ao]] on 27 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curacao-art.com/galleries/octagon-museum/|title=Octagon Museum \u2013 Cura\u00e7ao Art|publisher=}}</ref> It must be said, though, that Bol\u00edvar protested to the Spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled Miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the Crown but punishing a defector. In 1813, he was given a military command in [[Tunja]], [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] (modern-day [[Colombia]]), under the direction of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|Congress of United Provinces of New Granada]], which had formed out of the [[military junta|juntas]] established in 1810.\n\n====Second Republic of Venezuela (1813\u20131814) and exile====\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1816.jpg|thumb|Bol\u00edvar in 1816, during his stay in [[Haiti]]]]\n\nThis was the beginning of the [[Admirable Campaign]]. On 24 May, Bol\u00edvar entered [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], where he was proclaimed ''El Libertador'' (\"The Liberator\").<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1970\" /> This was followed by the occupation of [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]] on 9 June. Six days later, and as a result of Spanish massacres on independence supporters,  Bol\u00edvar dictated his famous \"[[Decree of War to the Death]]\", allowing the killing of any Spaniard not actively supporting independence. Caracas was retaken on 6 August 1813, and Bol\u00edvar was ratified as ''El Libertador'', establishing the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]]. The following year, because of the rebellion of [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] and the fall of the republic, Bol\u00edvar returned to New Granada, where he commanded a force for the United Provinces.\n\nHis forces entered [[Bogot\u00e1]] in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]]. Bol\u00edvar intended to march into [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the Royalist town of [[Santa Marta]]. In 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of Cartagena, Bol\u00edvar fled to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], where he was denied support.

Thus, the Liberator left the room where [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged his murderous knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.

The convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration. The federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline. Unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-Bol\u00edvar delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1954\">Bushnell, David (1954) ''The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia''</ref>\n\nTwo months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, Bol\u00edvar was declared president-liberator in Colombia's \"Organic Decree\".<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|394}} He considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents.<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|408}} An assassination attempt on 25 September 1828 failed (in Spanish it is indeed known as the ''Noche Septembrina''), thanks to the help of his lover, [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]].<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|399\u2013405}} Bol\u00edvar afterward described Manuela as \"Liberatrix of the Liberator\".<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|403}} Dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the next two years.<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1954\" />\n\nBolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the \"Santander\" faction. Eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established. Santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with Bolivar, was condemned to death. Bolivar, though, commuted the sentence.\n\nAfter the facts, Bolivar continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes.

Venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 January 1830 and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] maintained the presidency of that country, banishing Bolivar.\n\n====Dissolution of Gran Colombia====\nFor Bol\u00edvar, Hispanic America was the fatherland. He dreamed of a united Spanish America and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created Gran Colombia but also the Confederation of the Andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated South American countries together. Nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards in all directions.\n\nOn 20 January 1830, as his dream fell apart, Bol\u00edvar delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of Gran Colombia. In his speech, a distraught Bol\u00edvar urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation. (At the time, \"Colombians\" referred to the people of Gran Colombia (Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador), not modern-day Colombia):\n{{cquote|Bogot\u00e1, 20 January 1830.\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\n\nColombians! Today I cease to govern you. I have served you for twenty years as soldier and leader. During this long period we have taken back our country, liberated three republics, fomented many civil wars, and four times I have returned to the people their omnipotence, convening personally four constitutional congresses. These services were inspired by your virtues, your courage, and your patriotism; mine is the great privilege of having governed you.\n\nThe constitutional congress convened on this day is charged by Providence with the task of giving the nation the institutions she desires, following the course of circumstances and the nature of things.\n\nFearing that I may be regarded as an obstacle to establishing the Republic on the true base of its happiness, I personally have cast myself down from the supreme position of leadership to which your generosity had elevated me.\n\nColombians! I have been the victim of ignominious suspicions, with no possible way to defend the purity of my principles. The same persons who aspire to the supreme command have conspired to tear your hearts from me, attributing to me their own motives, making me seem to be the instigator of projects they themselves have conceived, representing me, finally, as aspiring to a crown which they themselves have offered on more than one occasion and which I have rejected with the indignation of the fiercest republican. Never, never, I swear to you, has it crossed my mind to aspire to a kingship that my enemies have fabricated in order to ruin me in your regard.\n\nDo not be deceived, Colombians! My only desire has been to contribute to your freedom and to be the preservation of your peace of mind. If for this I am held guilty, I deserve your censure more than any man. Do not listen, I beg you, to the vile slander and the tawdry envy stirring up discord on all sides. Will you allow yourself to be deceived by the false accusations of my detractors? Please don't be foolish!\n\nColombians! Gather around the constitutional congress. It represents the wisdom of the nation, the legitimate hope of the people, and the final point of reunion of the patriots. Its sovereign decrees will determine our lives, the happiness of the Republic, and the glory of Colombia. If dire circumstances should cause you to abandon it, there will be no health for the country, and you will drown in the ocean of anarchy, leaving as your children's legacy nothing but crime, blood, and death.\n\nFellow Countrymen!

Gran Colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador. Ironically, these countries were established as [[unitary state|centralist nations]], and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during Bol\u00edvar's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship. These separatists, among them [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], had justified their opposition to Bol\u00edvar for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch. Some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against Bol\u00edvar's life (Santander, who governed the second [[centralisation|centralist government]] of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], was associated with the [[:es:Conspiracion Septembrina|September Conspiracy]]).\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Obando]], the first President of the [[Republic of New Granada]] (that succeeded the Gran Colombia), had been directly linked to the assassination of [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] in 1830. Sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], ending the war against the Spanish Empire in South America. Bol\u00edvar also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of Gran Colombia after [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] was exiled in 1828.<ref>Harvey, Robert. \"Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America\".

These ''caudillos'' maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses. On his deathbed, Bol\u00edvar envisaged the emergence of countless ''caudillos'' competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about.\n\n==Final months and death==\n[[File:Muerte de Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.png|thumb|Bol\u00edvar's death, by Venezuelan painter [[Antonio Herrera Toro]]|alt=|left|225x225px]]\n\nSaying that \"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\",<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|450}} Bol\u00edvar finally resigned the presidency on 27 April 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in Europe.<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|435}} He had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to Europe,<ref name=\"Bol\u00edvar, Sim\u00f3n 1983\" /> but he died before setting sail from Cartagena.[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar - Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Bol\u00edvar at age 47 made from life by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa in 1830|alt=|225x225px]]\n\nOn 17 December 1830, at the age of 47, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar died of [[tuberculosis]]{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=19}} in the [[Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino]] in [[Santa Marta]], [[Gran Colombia]] (now [[Colombia]]).

Bol\u00edvar was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life. He swore never to marry again, a promise he kept. Many years later Bol\u00edvar would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life. Indeed, in 1828, he told Luis Per\u00fa de Lacroix the following words:\n\n{{cquote\n|You then [...] got married at the age of 45; [...] I was not even 18 years old when I did the same, and I was not even nearly 19 years old when I was widowed; I loved my wife dearly, and her death made me swear not to get married again, and I kept my word.

It was then that he met again with his old teacher Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez in Paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of Venezuela. He lived in [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] for a while and undertook the [[Grand Tour]].{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=}} During this time in Europe, Bol\u00edvar met the intellectual explorer, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in Rome.

She was more than a lover in Bol\u00edvar's later life; she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor. Moreover, Manuela saved Bol\u00edvar's life during the September Conspiracy of 1828 in which Bol\u00edvar was about to be killed. During such assassination attempt, Manuela diverted the assassins and thus gave Bol\u00edvar enough time to escape from his room.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Selected Writings of Bol\u00edvar|last=Lecuna|first=Vicente|publisher=The Colonial Press Inc.|year=1951|isbn=|location=New York|page=707}}</ref>\n\nBol\u00edvar and Manuela met in Quito on 22 June 1822 and they began a long-term affair.

Ducoudray Holstein joined Bol\u00edvar and served on his staff as an officer during this period.\n\nHe describes Bol\u00edvar as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations. He would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]] during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship. According to Ducoudray Holstein, Bol\u00edvar behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight. He was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety.\n\nIn the ''Diario de Bucaramanga'', Bol\u00edvar's opinion of Ducoudray is presented when [[Louis Peru de Lacroix]] asked who had been Bol\u00edvar's ''aides-de-camp'' since he had been general; he mentioned [[Charles Eloi Demarquet]] and Ducoudray. Bol\u00edvar confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his General Staff, but \"I never trusted him enough to make him my ''aide-de-camp''; to the contrary, I had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services\", and that Ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a \"real pleasure.\"<ref name=\"Diario de Bucaramanga, 2009\">{{cite book| last = Peru de Lacroix| first = Luis| title = Diario de Bucaramanga| location = Caracas| publisher = [[Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and Information]]| year = 2009| edition = print| url = http://limiliber.edu.ve/archivos%20PDF/Diario%20de%20Bucaramanga.pdf| access-date = 15 August 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125645/http://limiliber.edu.ve/archivos%20PDF/Diario%20de%20Bucaramanga.pdf| archive-date = 19 August 2014| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Karl Marx===\n{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote=\"Moreover a longish article on Bol\u00edvar elicited objections from Dana because, he said, it is written in a 'partisan style', and he asked me to cite my authorities.

Marx begins by saying that Bol\u00edvar was born to a family of \"creole nobility in Venezuela\" and that similar to the \"custom of wealthy Americans of those times, at the early age of 14 he was sent to Europe\". At several points in Marx's piece, he complains that Bol\u00edvar abandoned his troops multiple times and writes that Bol\u00edvar had to be persuaded by his cousin Ribas to return to fight against the Spanish after staying in Cartagena. Marx then penned that after arriving in Caracas in 1813, Bol\u00edvar's \"dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them\".

His sister Juana Bol\u00edvar y Palacios married their maternal uncle, Dionisio Palacios y Blanco, and had two children, Guillermo and Benigna. Guillermo Palacios died fighting alongside his uncle Sim\u00f3n in the battle of La Hogaza on 2 December 1817. Benigna had two marriages, the first to Pedro Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez and the second to Pedro Amestoy.<ref name=\"De-Sola Ricardo 1999 v1\" /> Their great-grandchildren, Bol\u00edvar's closest living relatives, Pedro, and [[Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa]] lived in [[Caracas]] as of 2009.\n\nHis eldest sister, Mar\u00eda Antonia, married Pablo Clemente Francia and had four children: Josefa, Anacleto, Valentina, and Pablo. Mar\u00eda Antonia became Bol\u00edvar's [[agent (law)|agent]] to deal with his properties while he served as president of Gran Colombia and she was an executrix of his will. She retired to Bol\u00edvar's estate in [[Libertador Municipality (Venezuelan Capital District)|Macarao]], which she inherited from him.<ref name=\"De-Sola Ricardo-dict\" />\n\nHis older brother, Juan Vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the United States, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: Juan, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, and Felicia Bol\u00edvar Tinoco. Bol\u00edvar provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death. Bol\u00edvar was especially close to Fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the United States, where he attended the [[University of Virginia]]. In his long life, Fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of Venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout Europe. He had three children, Benjam\u00edn Bol\u00edvar Gauthier, Santiago Hern\u00e1ndez Bol\u00edvar, and Claudio Bol\u00edvar Taraja. Fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88.<ref name=\"Fuentes Carvallo-dict\" />\n\n==Personal beliefs==\n===Politics===\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was an admirer of both the [[American Revolution|U.S.]] and [[French Revolution]]s.<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|35, 52\u201353}} Bol\u00edvar even enrolled his nephew, Fernando Bol\u00edvar, in a private school in Philadelphia, [[Germantown Academy]], and paid for his education, including attendance at Thomas Jefferson's [[University of Virginia]].<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|71\u201372, 369}} While he was an admirer of U.S. independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in Latin America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=}} Thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like Venezuela \"will require a firm hand\".{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=100}}\n\nBol\u00edvar felt that the U.S. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy. By contrast, he referred to Spanish America as having been subject to the \"triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice\".<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|224}} If a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty. This is shown when Bol\u00edvar blamed the fall of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|first republic]] on his subordinates trying to imitate \"some ethereal republic\" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of South America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=136}}\n\nAmong the books accompanying him as he traveled were [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Letters on the English|Letters]]'' and, when he was writing the Bolivian constitution, [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''.{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=33}} His Bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become Latin American conservatism in the later nineteenth century. The Bolivian constitution intended to establish a [[President for Life|lifelong presidency]] and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British unwritten constitution]], as it existed at the time.\n\nAccording to [[Carlos Fuentes]]:\n\n{{quote|text=How to govern ourselves after winning independence. It can be said that the Liberator exhausted his soul trying to find an answer to that question...Bol\u00edvar tried to avoid the extremes that would overwhelm Spanish America all along the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth. Tyranny or anarchy? 'Do not aim at what is impossible to attain, because in the quest for liberty we may fall into tyranny. Absolute liberty always leads to absolute power and among these two extremes is social liberty'. In order to find this equilibrium, Bol\u00edvar proposed a 'clever despotism', a strong executive power able to impose equality there where racial inequality prevailed. Bol\u00edvar warned against an 'aristocracy of rank, employment and fortune' that while 'referring to liberty and guarantee' it would just be for themselves but not for levelling with members of lower classes'...He is the disciple of Montesquieu in his insistence that institutions have to be adapted to culture.|title=El Espejo Enterrado|source=M\u00e9xico, Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica (1992), p. 272}}\n\n===Freemasonry===\nSimilarly to some others in the history of American Independence ([[George Washington]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], and [[Francisco de Miranda]]), Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].

In May 1806 he was conferred the rank of Master Mason in the \"Scottish Mother of St. Alexander of Scotland\" in Paris. During his time in London, he frequented \"The Great American Reunion\" lodge in London, founded by Francisco de Miranda.

In 1883, to celebrate 100 years since his birth, the Italian musician [[Nicol\u00f2 Gabrielli]] composed the [[triumphal march]] ''Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar'' and dedicated it to then [[president of Venezuela]] [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]]. In 1943 [[Darius Milhaud]] composed the opera [[Bol\u00edvar]]. He is also the central character in [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s 1989 novel ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'', in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy. In 1969 [[Maximilian Schell]] played the role of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in the film of the same name by director [[Alessandro Blasetti]], which also featured actress [[Rosanna Schiaffino]]. Bol\u00edvar's life was also the basis of the 2013 film ''[[The Liberator (film)|Libertador]]'', starring [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] and directed by Alberto Arvelo. In an episode of the Spanish TV series ''[[The Ministry of Time]]'', \"Tiempo de ilustrados (Time of the Enlightened)\", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife, as this was considered fundamental for Bol\u00edvar to fulfil his destiny.

Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the patriot victory at the [[Battle of Carabobo]] in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country.\n\nFollowing this triumph over the [[Spanish monarchy]], Bol\u00edvar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Latin America, [[Gran Colombia]], of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Through further military campaigns, he ousted Spanish rulers from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the last of which was named after him. He was simultaneously president of Gran Colombia (present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador), Peru, and Bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], was appointed president of Bolivia. Bol\u00edvar aimed at a strong and united Spanish America able to cope not only with the threats emanating from Spain and the European [[Holy Alliance]] but also with the emerging power of the [[United States]]. At the peak of his power, Bol\u00edvar ruled over a vast territory from the [[Argentina|Argentine]] border to the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nBol\u00edvar fought 472 battles, of which 79 were important ones, and during his campaigns rode on horseback 123,000 kilometers, which is 10 times more than [[Hannibal]], three times more than Napoleon, and twice as much as Alexander the Great.<ref>Toro Hardy, Alfredo, ''Understanding Latin America'' (2017), World Scientific, New Jersey, p. 47</ref> Bol\u00edvar is viewed as a [[Father of the Nation|national icon]] in much of modern South America, and is considered one of the great heroes of the [[Hispanic]] independence movements of the early 19th century, along with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], [[Francisco de Miranda]] and others. Towards the end of his life, Bol\u00edvar despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote \"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\".<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|450}} In an address to the Constituent Congress of the Republic of Colombia, Bol\u00edvar stated \"Fellow citizens!

Bol\u00edvar's first South American ancestor was Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar (or Simon de Bolibar; the [[Spanish orthography|spelling]] was not standardized until the 19th century), who lived and worked in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]) from 1559 to 1560 and where his son Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar y Castro was born. When the governor was reassigned to Venezuela by the Spanish Crown in 1569, Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar went with him. As an early settler in Spain's [[Venezuela Province]], he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted [[Plantation|estates]], [[encomienda]]s, and positions in the local [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]].{{sfn|Slatta|de Grummond|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEWHt-o8IdkC&pg=PA10 10\u201311]}}\n\nWhen [[Caracas Cathedral]] was built in 1569, the Bol\u00edvar family had one of the first dedicated side chapels. The majority of the wealth of Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar's descendants came from the estates. The most important was a sugar [[plantation]] with an [[encomienda]] that provided the labor needed to run the estate.{{sfn|Masur|1969|pp=21\u201322}} Another portion of the Bol\u00edvars' wealth came from [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]] mines. Small gold deposits were first mined in Venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits. From his mother's side (the Palacios family), Bol\u00edvar inherited the [[Aroa copper mines]] at [[Yaracuy|Cocorote]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African diaspora|African]] slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines.{{sfn|Thornton|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&pg=PA277 277]}}\n\n===17th century===\nToward the end of the 17th century, copper mining became so prominent in Venezuela that the metal became known as ''cobre Caracas'' (\"Caracas copper\"). Many of the mines became the property of the Bol\u00edvar family. Bol\u00edvar's grandfather, Juan de Bol\u00edvar y Mart\u00ednez de Villegas, paid 22,000 [[ducat]]s to the monastery at [[Santa Maria de Montserrat]] in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by King [[Philip V of Spain]] for its maintenance. The crown never issued the [[Letters patent|patent of nobility]], and so the purchase became the subject of [[lawsuit]]s that were still in progress during Bol\u00edvar's lifetime, when independence from Spain made the point moot. (If the lawsuits had been successful, Bol\u00edvar's older brother, Juan Vicente, would have become the [[Marquess]] of [[Villa de Cura|San Luis]] and [[Viscount]] of Cocorote.) Bol\u00edvar ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution.

A couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life. His father died before Bol\u00edvar's third birthday to tuberculosis,{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=9}} and his mother died when he was almost nine.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Bol\u00edvar was placed in the custody of an instructor, Miguel Jos\u00e9 Sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home. He went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]], Guillermo Pelgr\u00f3n, Jose Antonio Negrete, Fernando Vides, Father And\u00fajar, and Don [[Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], formerly known as Sim\u00f3n Carre\u00f1o. Don Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez became Bol\u00edvar's teacher, friend and mentor.

Bol\u00edvar then entered the military academy of the Milicias de Aragua.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}} In 1800, he was sent to Spain to follow his military studies in [[Madrid]], where he remained until 1802. Back in Europe in 1804, he lived in France and traveled to different countries. While in [[Milan]], Bol\u00edvar witnessed the coronation of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] as King of Italy (a kingdom in personal union with France in northern modern Italy), an event that left a profound impression on him.

After a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] on 19 April 1810, Venezuela achieved ''de facto'' independence when the [[Supreme Junta|Supreme Junta of Caracas]] was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Supreme Junta sent a delegation to [[Great Britain]] to get British recognition and aid. This delegation presided by Bol\u00edvar also included two future Venezuelan notables [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]] and Luis L\u00f3pez M\u00e9ndez. The trio met with [[Francisco de Miranda]] and persuaded him to return to his native land.\n\n====First Republic of Venezuela, 1811\u20131812====\nIn 1811, a delegation from the Supreme Junta, also including Bol\u00edvar, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received Miranda in [[La Guaira]].<ref>Crow (1992:431).</ref>  During the insurgence war conducted by Miranda, Bol\u00edvar was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year, 1812. As [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalist]] Frigate Captain [[Domingo de Monteverde]] was advancing into republican territory from the west, Bol\u00edvar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Bol\u00edvar then retreated to his estate in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]].\n\nMiranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with Monteverde on 25 July, an action that Bol\u00edvar and other revolutionary officers deemed [[treason]]ous. In one of Bol\u00edvar's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army at the port of La Guaira.<ref>Masur (1969), 98\u2013102; and Lynch, ''Bol\u00edvar: A Life'', 60\u201363.</ref> For his apparent services to the Royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol\u00edvar a passport, and Bol\u00edvar left for [[Cura\u00e7ao]] on 27 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curacao-art.com/galleries/octagon-museum/|title=Octagon Museum \u2013 Cura\u00e7ao Art|publisher=}}</ref> It must be said, though, that Bol\u00edvar protested to the Spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled Miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the Crown but punishing a defector. In 1813, he was given a military command in [[Tunja]], [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] (modern-day [[Colombia]]), under the direction of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|Congress of United Provinces of New Granada]], which had formed out of the [[military junta|juntas]] established in 1810.\n\n====Second Republic of Venezuela (1813\u20131814) and exile====\n[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, 1816.jpg|thumb|Bol\u00edvar in 1816, during his stay in [[Haiti]]]]\n\nThis was the beginning of the [[Admirable Campaign]]. On 24 May, Bol\u00edvar entered [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], where he was proclaimed ''El Libertador'' (\"The Liberator\").<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1970\" /> This was followed by the occupation of [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]] on 9 June. Six days later, and as a result of Spanish massacres on independence supporters,  Bol\u00edvar dictated his famous \"[[Decree of War to the Death]]\", allowing the killing of any Spaniard not actively supporting independence. Caracas was retaken on 6 August 1813, and Bol\u00edvar was ratified as ''El Libertador'', establishing the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]]. The following year, because of the rebellion of [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] and the fall of the republic, Bol\u00edvar returned to New Granada, where he commanded a force for the United Provinces.\n\nHis forces entered [[Bogot\u00e1]] in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]]. Bol\u00edvar intended to march into [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the Royalist town of [[Santa Marta]]. In 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of Cartagena, Bol\u00edvar fled to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], where he was denied support.

Thus, the Liberator left the room where [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged his murderous knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.

In an attempt to keep the nation together as a single entity, Bol\u00edvar called for a constitutional convention at [[Oca\u00f1a, Colombia|Oca\u00f1a]] in March 1828.{{sfn|Petre|1910|p=[https://archive.org/details/simonbolivarelli00petruoft/page/381 381\u201382]}}\n\n====Struggles inside Gran Colombia====\n[[File:El Libertador (Bol\u00edvar diplom\u00e1tico) 1860 000.jpg|thumb|left|200px|El Libertador (Bol\u00edvar diplom\u00e1tico), 1860.

The convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration. The federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline. Unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-Bol\u00edvar delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1954\">Bushnell, David (1954) ''The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia''</ref>\n\nTwo months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, Bol\u00edvar was declared president-liberator in Colombia's \"Organic Decree\".<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|394}} He considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents.<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|408}} An assassination attempt on 25 September 1828 failed (in Spanish it is indeed known as the ''Noche Septembrina''), thanks to the help of his lover, [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]].<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|399\u2013405}} Bol\u00edvar afterward described Manuela as \"Liberatrix of the Liberator\".<ref name=\"Arana\" />{{rp|403}} Dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the next two years.<ref name=\"Bushnell, David 1954\" />\n\nBolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the \"Santander\" faction. Eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established. Santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with Bolivar, was condemned to death. Bolivar, though, commuted the sentence.\n\nAfter the facts, Bolivar continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes.

Venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 January 1830 and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] maintained the presidency of that country, banishing Bolivar.\n\n====Dissolution of Gran Colombia====\nFor Bol\u00edvar, Hispanic America was the fatherland. He dreamed of a united Spanish America and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created Gran Colombia but also the Confederation of the Andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated South American countries together. Nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards in all directions.\n\nOn 20 January 1830, as his dream fell apart, Bol\u00edvar delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of Gran Colombia. In his speech, a distraught Bol\u00edvar urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation. (At the time, \"Colombians\" referred to the people of Gran Colombia (Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador), not modern-day Colombia):\n{{cquote|Bogot\u00e1, 20 January 1830.\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\n\nColombians! Today I cease to govern you. I have served you for twenty years as soldier and leader. During this long period we have taken back our country, liberated three republics, fomented many civil wars, and four times I have returned to the people their omnipotence, convening personally four constitutional congresses. These services were inspired by your virtues, your courage, and your patriotism; mine is the great privilege of having governed you.\n\nThe constitutional congress convened on this day is charged by Providence with the task of giving the nation the institutions she desires, following the course of circumstances and the nature of things.\n\nFearing that I may be regarded as an obstacle to establishing the Republic on the true base of its happiness, I personally have cast myself down from the supreme position of leadership to which your generosity had elevated me.\n\nColombians! I have been the victim of ignominious suspicions, with no possible way to defend the purity of my principles. The same persons who aspire to the supreme command have conspired to tear your hearts from me, attributing to me their own motives, making me seem to be the instigator of projects they themselves have conceived, representing me, finally, as aspiring to a crown which they themselves have offered on more than one occasion and which I have rejected with the indignation of the fiercest republican. Never, never, I swear to you, has it crossed my mind to aspire to a kingship that my enemies have fabricated in order to ruin me in your regard.\n\nDo not be deceived, Colombians! My only desire has been to contribute to your freedom and to be the preservation of your peace of mind. If for this I am held guilty, I deserve your censure more than any man. Do not listen, I beg you, to the vile slander and the tawdry envy stirring up discord on all sides. Will you allow yourself to be deceived by the false accusations of my detractors? Please don't be foolish!\n\nColombians! Gather around the constitutional congress. It represents the wisdom of the nation, the legitimate hope of the people, and the final point of reunion of the patriots. Its sovereign decrees will determine our lives, the happiness of the Republic, and the glory of Colombia. If dire circumstances should cause you to abandon it, there will be no health for the country, and you will drown in the ocean of anarchy, leaving as your children's legacy nothing but crime, blood, and death.\n\nFellow Countrymen!

Gran Colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador. Ironically, these countries were established as [[unitary state|centralist nations]], and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during Bol\u00edvar's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship. These separatists, among them [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], had justified their opposition to Bol\u00edvar for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch. Some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against Bol\u00edvar's life (Santander, who governed the second [[centralisation|centralist government]] of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], was associated with the [[:es:Conspiracion Septembrina|September Conspiracy]]).\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Obando]], the first President of the [[Republic of New Granada]] (that succeeded the Gran Colombia), had been directly linked to the assassination of [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] in 1830. Sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], ending the war against the Spanish Empire in South America. Bol\u00edvar also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of Gran Colombia after [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] was exiled in 1828.<ref>Harvey, Robert. \"Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America\".

These ''caudillos'' maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses. On his deathbed, Bol\u00edvar envisaged the emergence of countless ''caudillos'' competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about.\n\n==Final months and death==\n[[File:Muerte de Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.png|thumb|Bol\u00edvar's death, by Venezuelan painter [[Antonio Herrera Toro]]|alt=|left|225x225px]]\n\nSaying that \"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\",<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|450}} Bol\u00edvar finally resigned the presidency on 27 April 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in Europe.<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|435}} He had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to Europe,<ref name=\"Bol\u00edvar, Sim\u00f3n 1983\" /> but he died before setting sail from Cartagena.[[File:Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar - Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Bol\u00edvar at age 47 made from life by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espinosa in 1830|alt=|225x225px]]\n\nOn 17 December 1830, at the age of 47, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar died of [[tuberculosis]]{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=19}} in the [[Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino]] in [[Santa Marta]], [[Gran Colombia]] (now [[Colombia]]).

Bol\u00edvar was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life. He swore never to marry again, a promise he kept. Many years later Bol\u00edvar would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life. Indeed, in 1828, he told Luis Per\u00fa de Lacroix the following words:\n\n{{cquote\n|You then [...] got married at the age of 45; [...] I was not even 18 years old when I did the same, and I was not even nearly 19 years old when I was widowed; I loved my wife dearly, and her death made me swear not to get married again, and I kept my word.

It was then that he met again with his old teacher Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez in Paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of Venezuela. He lived in [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] for a while and undertook the [[Grand Tour]].{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=}} During this time in Europe, Bol\u00edvar met the intellectual explorer, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in Rome.

She was more than a lover in Bol\u00edvar's later life; she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor. Moreover, Manuela saved Bol\u00edvar's life during the September Conspiracy of 1828 in which Bol\u00edvar was about to be killed. During such assassination attempt, Manuela diverted the assassins and thus gave Bol\u00edvar enough time to escape from his room.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Selected Writings of Bol\u00edvar|last=Lecuna|first=Vicente|publisher=The Colonial Press Inc.|year=1951|isbn=|location=New York|page=707}}</ref>\n\nBol\u00edvar and Manuela met in Quito on 22 June 1822 and they began a long-term affair.

Ducoudray Holstein joined Bol\u00edvar and served on his staff as an officer during this period.\n\nHe describes Bol\u00edvar as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations. He would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]] during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship. According to Ducoudray Holstein, Bol\u00edvar behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight. He was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety.\n\nIn the ''Diario de Bucaramanga'', Bol\u00edvar's opinion of Ducoudray is presented when [[Louis Peru de Lacroix]] asked who had been Bol\u00edvar's ''aides-de-camp'' since he had been general; he mentioned [[Charles Eloi Demarquet]] and Ducoudray. Bol\u00edvar confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his General Staff, but \"I never trusted him enough to make him my ''aide-de-camp''; to the contrary, I had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services\", and that Ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a \"real pleasure.\"<ref name=\"Diario de Bucaramanga, 2009\">{{cite book| last = Peru de Lacroix| first = Luis| title = Diario de Bucaramanga| location = Caracas| publisher = [[Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and Information]]| year = 2009| edition = print| url = http://limiliber.edu.ve/archivos%20PDF/Diario%20de%20Bucaramanga.pdf| access-date = 15 August 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125645/http://limiliber.edu.ve/archivos%20PDF/Diario%20de%20Bucaramanga.pdf| archive-date = 19 August 2014| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Karl Marx===\n{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote=\"Moreover a longish article on Bol\u00edvar elicited objections from Dana because, he said, it is written in a 'partisan style', and he asked me to cite my authorities.

Marx begins by saying that Bol\u00edvar was born to a family of \"creole nobility in Venezuela\" and that similar to the \"custom of wealthy Americans of those times, at the early age of 14 he was sent to Europe\". At several points in Marx's piece, he complains that Bol\u00edvar abandoned his troops multiple times and writes that Bol\u00edvar had to be persuaded by his cousin Ribas to return to fight against the Spanish after staying in Cartagena. Marx then penned that after arriving in Caracas in 1813, Bol\u00edvar's \"dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them\".

His closest living relatives descend from his sisters and brother. One of his sisters died in infancy. His sister Juana Bol\u00edvar y Palacios married their maternal uncle, Dionisio Palacios y Blanco, and had two children, Guillermo and Benigna. Guillermo Palacios died fighting alongside his uncle Sim\u00f3n in the battle of La Hogaza on 2 December 1817. Benigna had two marriages, the first to Pedro Brice\u00f1o M\u00e9ndez and the second to Pedro Amestoy.<ref name=\"De-Sola Ricardo 1999 v1\" /> Their great-grandchildren, Bol\u00edvar's closest living relatives, Pedro, and [[Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa]] lived in [[Caracas]] as of 2009.\n\nHis eldest sister, Mar\u00eda Antonia, married Pablo Clemente Francia and had four children: Josefa, Anacleto, Valentina, and Pablo. Mar\u00eda Antonia became Bol\u00edvar's [[agent (law)|agent]] to deal with his properties while he served as president of Gran Colombia and she was an executrix of his will. She retired to Bol\u00edvar's estate in [[Libertador Municipality (Venezuelan Capital District)|Macarao]], which she inherited from him.<ref name=\"De-Sola Ricardo-dict\" />\n\nHis older brother, Juan Vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the United States, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: Juan, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, and Felicia Bol\u00edvar Tinoco. Bol\u00edvar provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death. Bol\u00edvar was especially close to Fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the United States, where he attended the [[University of Virginia]]. In his long life, Fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of Venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout Europe. He had three children, Benjam\u00edn Bol\u00edvar Gauthier, Santiago Hern\u00e1ndez Bol\u00edvar, and Claudio Bol\u00edvar Taraja. Fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88.<ref name=\"Fuentes Carvallo-dict\" />\n\n==Personal beliefs==\n===Politics===\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was an admirer of both the [[American Revolution|U.S.]] and [[French Revolution]]s.<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|35, 52\u201353}} Bol\u00edvar even enrolled his nephew, Fernando Bol\u00edvar, in a private school in Philadelphia, [[Germantown Academy]], and paid for his education, including attendance at Thomas Jefferson's [[University of Virginia]].<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|71\u201372, 369}} While he was an admirer of U.S. independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in Latin America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=}} Thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like Venezuela \"will require a firm hand\".{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=100}}\n\nBol\u00edvar felt that the U.S. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy. By contrast, he referred to Spanish America as having been subject to the \"triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice\".<ref name=Arana/>{{rp|224}} If a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty. This is shown when Bol\u00edvar blamed the fall of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|first republic]] on his subordinates trying to imitate \"some ethereal republic\" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of South America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=136}}\n\nAmong the books accompanying him as he traveled were [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Letters on the English|Letters]]'' and, when he was writing the Bolivian constitution, [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''.{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=33}} His Bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become Latin American conservatism in the later nineteenth century. The Bolivian constitution intended to establish a [[President for Life|lifelong presidency]] and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British unwritten constitution]], as it existed at the time.\n\nAccording to [[Carlos Fuentes]]:\n\n{{quote|text=How to govern ourselves after winning independence. It can be said that the Liberator exhausted his soul trying to find an answer to that question...Bol\u00edvar tried to avoid the extremes that would overwhelm Spanish America all along the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth. Tyranny or anarchy? 'Do not aim at what is impossible to attain, because in the quest for liberty we may fall into tyranny. Absolute liberty always leads to absolute power and among these two extremes is social liberty'. In order to find this equilibrium, Bol\u00edvar proposed a 'clever despotism', a strong executive power able to impose equality there where racial inequality prevailed. Bol\u00edvar warned against an 'aristocracy of rank, employment and fortune' that while 'referring to liberty and guarantee' it would just be for themselves but not for levelling with members of lower classes'...He is the disciple of Montesquieu in his insistence that institutions have to be adapted to culture.|title=El Espejo Enterrado|source=M\u00e9xico, Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica (1992), p. 272}}\n\n===Freemasonry===\nSimilarly to some others in the history of American Independence ([[George Washington]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], and [[Francisco de Miranda]]), Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].

In 1883, to celebrate 100 years since his birth, the Italian musician [[Nicol\u00f2 Gabrielli]] composed the [[triumphal march]] ''Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar'' and dedicated it to then [[president of Venezuela]] [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]]. In 1943 [[Darius Milhaud]] composed the opera [[Bol\u00edvar]]. He is also the central character in [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s 1989 novel ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'', in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy. In 1969 [[Maximilian Schell]] played the role of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in the film of the same name by director [[Alessandro Blasetti]], which also featured actress [[Rosanna Schiaffino]]. Bol\u00edvar's life was also the basis of the 2013 film ''[[The Liberator (film)|Libertador]]'', starring [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] and directed by Alberto Arvelo. In an episode of the Spanish TV series ''[[The Ministry of Time]]'', \"Tiempo de ilustrados (Time of the Enlightened)\", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife, as this was considered fundamental for Bol\u00edvar to fulfil his destiny.

It was occupied in 1975 and is administered by [[Anne Arundel County Public Schools]] (AACPS). The school was built to alleviate over-crowding at [[Arundel High School|Arundel]] and [[Severna Park High School|Severna Park]] High Schools. The school has no walls and no roofs in some classrooms, only partitions to separate their classrooms. Along with [[Annapolis High School (Maryland)|Annapolis High School]] and [[Meade Senior High School]], Old Mill Senior High is one of the three [[IB Diploma Programme|IB World Schools]] in [[Anne Arundel County]]. The school building also houses the high school's two feeder schools, Old Mill Middle School North and Old Mill Middle School South.  The school [[mascot]] is ''The Patriot''. Old Mill excels in academics{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} as well as athletics, including on December 4, 2009 when Old Mill won the State Football Championship against Henry A. Wise, and on December 2, 2011  when Old Mill won the State Football Championship against Quince Orchard. While Old Mill's recent success in football is impressive it pales in comparison to Old Mill's consistent success on the wrestling mat. Old Mill is a perennial force on the wrestling mat with an impressive 9 State Championships (2009, 2007, 2003, 1995, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990, 1989). Former Old Mill Head Wrestling Coach, Mike Hampe is in the National Hall of Fame and helped to build one of the most successful programs in the state of Maryland, if not the most successful. Old Mill also has major accomplishments in track & field and basketball. Old Mill's rivals are [[Arundel High School]] and [[Meade Senior High School|Meade High School]].\n\n==Academics==\nOld Mill High School is a public, magnet school located in Millersville, MD.

The main entrance is at the north end of the piazza, which was cobbled with rectangular blocks of white [[marble]] and decorated by a large equestrian statue of Trajan.

[[Trajan's Column]] was erected and then inaugurated in 113.\n\nTo build this monumental complex, extensive excavations were required: workers eliminated a ridge connecting the [[Quirinal]] and [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] (Campidoglio) Hills. Over 300,000 cubic meters of soil and rock were excavated and dumped outside the [[Porta Collina]].<ref name=\"Carandini\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome| author=Rodolfo Lanciani| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year=1897| p=312}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the excavations were initiated under [[Domitian|Emperor Domitian]], while the project of the Forum was completely attributed to the architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]],<ref name=roth/> who also accompanied Emperor Trajan in the Dacian campaign.\n\nDuring the time of the construction, several other projects took place: the construction of the [[Markets of Trajan]],<ref name=roth/> and the renovation of the [[Caesar's Forum]] (where the [[Basilica Argentaria]] was built)  and the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe Forum consisted of a sequence of open and enclosed spaces, beginning with the vast [[portico]]-lined [[piazza]] measuring {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|185|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, with ''[[exedra]]e'' on two sides. The main entrance is at the north end of the piazza, which was cobbled with rectangular blocks of white [[marble]] and decorated by a large equestrian statue of Trajan. On either side of the piazza are markets, also housed by the exedrae. The open space of the Forum measured about 300 feet by 380 feet.<ref>Fritz Heichelheim, Cedric Veo, Allan Ward(1984);A History of the Roman People; Prentice-Hall; Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey</ref> Originally, the forum was enclosed within high walls built from blocks of [[Peperino]] tuff, covered with a marble veneer, similar to those used to enclose the fora of [[Forum of Augustus| Augustus]] and [[Forum of Nerva| Nerva]].<ref>{{cite book| title=The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome| author=Rodolfo Lanciani| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year=1897| p=312-13}}</ref> Via the wall on the far east side of Trajan's Forum, where there was a doorway which led into a communicating annex, one could gain entry into the neighboring Forum of Augustus, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=176}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trajan forum.jpg|thumb|Plan of Trajan's Forum]]\nAlong the piazza's north side was the [[Basilica Ulpia]], and north of that was a smaller piazza, with a [[temple of Trajan|temple dedicated to the deified Trajan]] on the far north side facing inwards. The position of - and very existence of - the temple dedicated to the deified Trajan is a matter of hotly contested debate among archaeologists, particularly clear in the ongoing debate between James E. Packer and Roberto Meneghini.<ref>J. E. Packer and J. Burge, \u201cTemplum Divi Traiani Parthici et Plotinae: a debate with R.

The building consisted of three parallel halls separated by annexes and was known as the ''Athenaeum''; it functioned variously as school, a venue for judicial proceedings, and an occasional meeting-place for the Senate.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=177}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Platner-fora-imperial-96a Recontructed.jpg|thumb|Map of the Imperial Fora showing Trajan's Forum]]\n[[Constantius II]], while visiting Rome in the year 357,<ref name=guide>{{cite book | title = Archaeological Guide to Rome | publisher = Electa | editor-last = La Regina | editor-first = Adriano | orig-year = 2004 | edition = New update | year = 2007 | others = Richard Sadleir (trans.) | page=188}}</ref> was amazed by the huge equestrian statue of Trajan and by the surrounding buildings:\n\n{{quote|text=But when he [Constantius II] came to the Forum of Trajan, a construction unique under the heavens, as we believe, and admirable even in the unanimous opinion of the gods, he stood fast in amazement, turning his attention to the gigantic complex about him, beggaring description and never again to be imitated by mortal men. So renouncing all hope of attempting anything of the kind, he said he wanted to imitate only Trajan's horse, set in the middle of the atrium, and with the emperor on its back.

A number of columns which historically formed the Basilica Ulpia remained on site, and have been re-erected. The construction of the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]] in 1933 covered a number of these columns, which remain visible under the arches on which the road runs.\n\n==Post-Roman history==\nIn the mid-9th century, the marble cobble blocks of the piazza were systematically taken for re-use, because of the good quality of the lime.
