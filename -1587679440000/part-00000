European workers on several occasions asked permission from the Commander of the Cape at the time, Van Riebeeck, to be discharged from the service of the VOC, in order to cultivate the lands. On the 20th of February, Van Riebeeck accompanied them to mark out their plots and draw up preliminary conditions.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\nServants of the VOC could return to their homes in Europe after their term of service had been carried out. Yet some workers chose to be discharged from service earlier than their term in order to live permanently at the Cape. The families of the free burghers were then brought from Europe to South Africa. Others after serving their term of service at the VOC also decided to stay at the Cape rather than returning to Europe who also received free burgher status. After the founding of the two free burgher colonies in February 1657, many more requested to be discharged from the service of the VOC. Letters of freedom were not issued to everyone who applied. By the 25th of September, 20 applications had been received and only five of them were enrolled as freemen.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\nSome of the men received limited free burgher status with conditions favourable to both the VOC and the applicant. Limited in terms of the duration of term which the applicant would be allowed to maintain free burgher status.

The opportunities to become a successful entrepreneur were abundant and many skilled Europeans applied for free burgher status. The VOC had built a corn mill which was operated by the use of horses, but after a short time it was decided to make use of river water as a motive power. The tender for the construction of the mill was awarded to free burgher Wouter Mostert and when it was in working order he took charge of it and received income on shares of payments made for grinding.<ref name=HisSA88-206>History of South Africa (1486 - 1691), G.M. Theal, London 1888, p88 - 206</ref>\n\nSome of the men who had received land established themselves as farmers while others took service with the farmers as farm workers. Leendert Cornelissen, a ships carpenter, who received a grant of a strip of forest at the foot of the mountain. His object was to cut timber for sale, all kinds of which prices were fixed by the council while Elbert Dirksen and Hendrik van Surwerden made a living as tailors. Most received their free papers because they possessed a certain useful skill such as Christian Janssen and Peter Cornelissen who had been expert hunters in the Company's service. Most free burghers negotiated deals with the VOC which were beneficial to both the Company and the burgher such as Dr Jan Vetteman, the surgeon of the fort, who arranged for a monopoly of practice in his profession.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\nApplicants received land in accordance to the purposes for which the land was to be used while carefully taking into consideration the set of skills and experiences possessed by each individual. Roelof Zieuwerts, for instance, received a small piece of forest where he could make a living as a wagon and plough maker. Martin Vlockaart, Pieter Jacobs and Jan Adriansen maintained themselves as fishermen, while Pieter Kley, Dirk Vreem, and Pieter Heynse made a living by sawing and selling yellow wood plank as well as to work their occupation as carpenters.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== Slaves ===\n\nThe merchant vessel named ''Amersfoort'' had captured 250 Angolan slaves, mostly children, from a Portuguese slaver on the Brazilian coast<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/first-enslaved-people-arrive-cape-town</ref>. The vessel arrived on the 28th of March 1658 at Table Bay. The settlers assisted the people on board of the ship with refreshments. The tedious journey at sea had its toll on the crew and slaves as the ''Amersfoort'' arrived with 323 men whereof 29 dead and 30 sick<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />. Jan van Riebeeck decided to start a school for the enslaved children, making sure they got a Christian Dutch education until they were old and strong enough to work for the Dutch settlers.\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe first school to be built in South Africa were for the purpose of educating the rescued slaves from the ''Amersfoort''. However, the school were later also used to educate the children of the free burghers. At school, the children were taught to read and write and to compile accounts in [[Dutch gulden|gulden]] and stuivers. The school fees were equal to one half [[shilling]] per month for each child of a burgher, enslaved and [[Khoisan]] children were taught free of charge or Pro Deo.\n\n== Governance ==\n\n=== Trade ===\n\nDuring a visit from the commissioner [[Rijcklof van Goens]] in 1657, several regulations concerning the burghers were drawn up as well as copious instructions on general guidance of the government. The following restriction were placed on servants of the Company, which greatly benefited the burghers since they were no longer regarded as servants.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n*Servants were prohibited from cultivating larger gardens than required for their own use\n*Burghers were allowed to purchase cattle from the [[Khoisan]], provided they buy the cattle at the same price as the company were offering<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== Burgher Council ===\n\nThe free burghers nominated persons among them who could serve as representatives at the Council meetings at the Cape. The first burgher Councillor (Dutch title: burgherraden), Steven Jansz, was appointed in 1657 by the [[Rijcklof van Goens]]. The following year he was joined by his colleague Hendrik Boom to serve as ''burgherraden'' in the Council.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\n=== Dutch East India Company ===\n\nThe high ranking commissioner Mattheus van der Broeck of the Dutch East India Company arrived at the settlement in early 1670 accompanied with a fleet of fifteen ships. After deliberation about the general functioning of the settlement, the high ranking officers issued several important written instructions which revealed the Company's position towards the free burghers. Commissioner Van der Broeck's visit reached the following conclusion.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n*The settlement did not produce sufficient grain for the consumption of the garrison and inhabitants resulting in the importation of a large quantity of rice yearly. It was decided that, in order to reduce costs, a large farming community consisting of 'free burghers' were to be established at Hottentots Holland. It was decided to raise the price for grain in order to encourage the free burgher farmers\n\n*The commissioner was not impressed with the canteens operated by the free burghers and limited the number of canteens to nine for the whole settlement, Jacob Rosendael was permitted to sell wine produced from his vineyard\n\n*The first [[Request for tender|tender]] for construction work in South Africa was awarded to free burgher Wouter Mostert, setting the precedent for public works tenders in future. In addition, it was decided that free burghers were allowed to tender for the supply of construction materials required by the Company\n\n*Free burghers were prohibited to trade livestock with the [[Khoisan]], however licenses were granted to the burghers in order to hunt large game wherever they chose\n\n=== Burgher Militia ===\n\nThe commissioner further instructed the Cape authorities to provide assistance to the free burghers not only for the sake of produce but in order to gain favour because of the assistance which they could present in time of war. During the time, in 1670, the free burghers constituted a company of militia eighty-nine strong.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:South Africa (1909) (14781850654).jpg|thumb|220px|French Huguenots building a house at the Cape]]\n\n=== Dutch Free Immigrants ===\n\nThe authorities of the East India Company had endeavoured to induce gardeners and small farmers to emigrate from Europe to South Africa, but with little success. Now and again they were able to send out to their eastern possessions a few families who were attracted by the tales of wealth. But the Cape had little charm in comparison. In October 1670, however, the Chamber of Amsterdam announced that a few families were willing to leave for the Cape and Mauritius during the following December. Among the new names of burghers at this time are found those of Jacob and Dirk van Niekerk, Johannes van As, Francois Villion, Jacob Brouwer, Jan van Eden, Hermanus Potgieter, Albertus Gildenhuis, and Jacobus van den Berg.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== French Huguenots ===\n\nDuring 1688\u20131689, the colony was greatly strengthened by the arrival of nearly two hundred French [[Huguenots]]. Political refugees from the religious wars in France, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], they were settled at [[Stellenbosch]], [[Drakenstein]], [[Franschhoek]] (\"French corner\") and [[Paarl]].<ref>H. C. Viljoen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091025222633/http://geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm The Contribution of the Huguenots in South Africa], 25 October 2009</ref> The influence of this small body of immigrants on the character of the Dutch settlers was marked. The Company in 1701 directed that only [[Dutch language|Dutch]] should be taught in the schools. This resulted in the Huguenots assimilating by the middle of the 18th century, with a loss to the community in the use and knowledge of [[French language|French]]. The little settlement gradually spread eastwards, and in 1754 the country as far as [[Algoa Bay]] was included in the colony.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cape Colony]]\n[[Category:History of South Africa]]\n\n[[Category:Settlers of South Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{hatnote|Not to be confused with [[Grand Burgher]], [[Burgher (Church history)]] or [[Burgher people]].

One of the causes for the [[Dutch Golden Age]] is attributed to the migration of skilled craftsmen to the Dutch Republic of which Protestants were especially well-represented. Economists [[Ronald Findlay]] and [[Kevin O'Rourke|Kevin H. O'Rourke]] attribute part of the Dutch ascendancy to its [[Protestant work ethic]] based on [[Calvinism]], which promoted thrift and education. This contributed to \"the lowest [[interest rates]] and the highest [[literacy]] rates in Europe. The abundance of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] made it possible to maintain an impressive stock of [[wealth]], embodied not only in the large [[Naval history of the Netherlands|fleet]] but in the plentiful stocks of an array of [[commodities]] that were used to stabilize prices and take advantage of profit opportunities.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9585.pdf|title=Commodity Market Integration, 1500\u20132000|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== The first freemen ==\n\nIn 1656, Commander [[Jan van Riebeeck]] considered the idea of freemen at the Cape, he was of the opinion that the cost of supplying housing and protection to such free households would be too great. The Directors of the VOC however, were in favour to establish freemen under favourable conditions.<ref name=Precis1656-1658>Precis of the Archives of the Cape of Good Hope, January 1656 - December 1658, Riebeeck's Journal &c, H.C.V Leibrandt, Part II, Cape Town 1897.</ref>\n\n=== Harman\u2019s Colony  ===\nOn the 21st of February 1657, following an application process where the best applicants were selected, a party of five were allowed to select land which they could occupy and use as freemen. They chose an area about fifteen kilometres away from the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] on the other side of the [[Liesbeek River]]. They were allowed to select a piece of land as long and broad as they wished, on condition that they were to remain on the other side of the river.

European workers on several occasions asked permission from the Commander of the Cape at the time, Van Riebeeck, to be discharged from the service of the VOC, in order to cultivate the lands. On the 20th of February, Van Riebeeck accompanied them to mark out their plots and draw up preliminary conditions.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\nServants of the VOC could return to their homes in Europe after their term of service had been carried out. Yet some workers chose to be discharged from service earlier than their term in order to live permanently at the Cape. The families of the free burghers were then brought from Europe to South Africa. Others after serving their term of service at the VOC also decided to stay at the Cape rather than returning to Europe who also received free burgher status. After the founding of the two free burgher colonies in February 1657, many more requested to be discharged from the service of the VOC. Letters of freedom were not issued to everyone who applied. By the 25th of September, 20 applications had been received and only five of them were enrolled as freemen.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\nSome of the men received limited free burgher status with conditions favourable to both the VOC and the applicant. Limited in terms of the duration of term which the applicant would be allowed to maintain free burgher status. The duration of the five who were enrolled as free burghers in September 1657 is as follows:<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Duration of Free Burgher Status granted in September 1657<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n|-\n!Name !!City of Birth !!Occupation!!Duration of Status\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Hendrik Surwerden||[[Sarrewerden]]||Corporal||12 Years\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Elbert Dirksz||[[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]||Soldier||12 Years\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Harmen Ernst||[[Utrecht]]||Boatman||3 Years\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Cornelis Claesz||[[Utrecht]]||Boatman||6 Years\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Hendrik Boom||[[Amsterdam]]||Master Gardener||Lifelong\n|}\n\n=== Settlement map ===\n\n[[Image:The Free Burghers Settlement.jpg|thumb|left|390px|Settlement of the first Free Burghers]]\n{{legend|PaleGreen|Company's Garden, at [[Rondebosch]]}}\n{{legend|yellow|Company's grain-fields, at [[Groote Schuur]]}}\n{{legend|#ac6600|Land Granted to Free Burghers in 1657 at Groeneveld(Stephen's Colony) and Dutch Garden (Harman's Colony)<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />}}\n{{legend|red|Military forts and watch-houses}}\n{{legend|purple|Company's orchards, near the Fort of Good Hope}}\n{{legend|DeepPink|Jan van Riebeeck's farms}}\n{{legend|orange|Boundary fence which were later by a hedge also known as [[Van Riebeeck's Hedge]]}}\n{{legend|white|text=&nbsp;1|Oliphant Street (to-day Longmarket Street)}}\n{{legend|white|text=&nbsp;2|Reijger Street Street (to-day Shortmarket Street)}}\n{{legend|white|text=&nbsp;3|Heere Street Street (to-day Castle Street)}}\n{{legend|white|Small freehold farms granted later|outline=brown}}\n{{legend|white|text=&nbsp;4|Otto van Vrede and J Cornelissen}}\n{{legend|white|text=&nbsp;5|S.

The opportunities to become a successful entrepreneur were abundant and many skilled Europeans applied for free burgher status. The VOC had built a corn mill which was operated by the use of horses, but after a short time it was decided to make use of river water as a motive power. The tender for the construction of the mill was awarded to free burgher Wouter Mostert and when it was in working order he took charge of it and received income on shares of payments made for grinding.<ref name=HisSA88-206>History of South Africa (1486 - 1691), G.M. Theal, London 1888, p88 - 206</ref>\n\nSome of the men who had received land established themselves as farmers while others took service with the farmers as farm workers. Leendert Cornelissen, a ships carpenter, who received a grant of a strip of forest at the foot of the mountain. His object was to cut timber for sale, all kinds of which prices were fixed by the council while Elbert Dirksen and Hendrik van Surwerden made a living as tailors. Most received their free papers because they possessed a certain useful skill such as Christian Janssen and Peter Cornelissen who had been expert hunters in the Company's service. Most free burghers negotiated deals with the VOC which were beneficial to both the Company and the burgher such as Dr Jan Vetteman, the surgeon of the fort, who arranged for a monopoly of practice in his profession.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\nApplicants received land in accordance to the purposes for which the land was to be used while carefully taking into consideration the set of skills and experiences possessed by each individual. Roelof Zieuwerts, for instance, received a small piece of forest where he could make a living as a wagon and plough maker. Martin Vlockaart, Pieter Jacobs and Jan Adriansen maintained themselves as fishermen, while Pieter Kley, Dirk Vreem, and Pieter Heynse made a living by sawing and selling yellow wood plank as well as to work their occupation as carpenters.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== Slaves ===\n\nThe merchant vessel named ''Amersfoort'' had captured 250 Angolan slaves, mostly children, from a Portuguese slaver on the Brazilian coast<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/first-enslaved-people-arrive-cape-town</ref>. The vessel arrived on the 28th of March 1658 at Table Bay. The settlers assisted the people on board of the ship with refreshments. The tedious journey at sea had its toll on the crew and slaves as the ''Amersfoort'' arrived with 323 men whereof 29 dead and 30 sick<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />. Jan van Riebeeck decided to start a school for the enslaved children, making sure they got a Christian Dutch education until they were old and strong enough to work for the Dutch settlers.\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe first school to be built in South Africa were for the purpose of educating the rescued slaves from the ''Amersfoort''. However, the school were later also used to educate the children of the free burghers. At school, the children were taught to read and write and to compile accounts in [[Dutch gulden|gulden]] and stuivers. The school fees were equal to one half [[shilling]] per month for each child of a burgher, enslaved and [[Khoisan]] children were taught free of charge or Pro Deo.\n\n== Governance ==\n\n=== Trade ===\n\nDuring a visit from the commissioner [[Rijcklof van Goens]] in 1657, several regulations concerning the burghers were drawn up as well as copious instructions on general guidance of the government. The following restriction were placed on servants of the Company, which greatly benefited the burghers since they were no longer regarded as servants.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n*Servants were prohibited from cultivating larger gardens than required for their own use\n*Burghers were allowed to purchase cattle from the [[Khoisan]], provided they buy the cattle at the same price as the company were offering<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== Burgher Council ===\n\nThe free burghers nominated persons among them who could serve as representatives at the Council meetings at the Cape. The first burgher Councillor (Dutch title: burgherraden), Steven Jansz, was appointed in 1657 by the [[Rijcklof van Goens]]. The following year he was joined by his colleague Hendrik Boom to serve as ''burgherraden'' in the Council.<ref name=Precis1656-1658 />\n\n=== Dutch East India Company ===\n\nThe high ranking commissioner Mattheus van der Broeck of the Dutch East India Company arrived at the settlement in early 1670 accompanied with a fleet of fifteen ships. After deliberation about the general functioning of the settlement, the high ranking officers issued several important written instructions which revealed the Company's position towards the free burghers. Commissioner Van der Broeck's visit reached the following conclusion.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n*The settlement did not produce sufficient grain for the consumption of the garrison and inhabitants resulting in the importation of a large quantity of rice yearly. It was decided that, in order to reduce costs, a large farming community consisting of 'free burghers' were to be established at Hottentots Holland. It was decided to raise the price for grain in order to encourage the free burgher farmers\n\n*The commissioner was not impressed with the canteens operated by the free burghers and limited the number of canteens to nine for the whole settlement, Jacob Rosendael was permitted to sell wine produced from his vineyard\n\n*The first [[Request for tender|tender]] for construction work in South Africa was awarded to free burgher Wouter Mostert, setting the precedent for public works tenders in future. In addition, it was decided that free burghers were allowed to tender for the supply of construction materials required by the Company\n\n*Free burghers were prohibited to trade livestock with the [[Khoisan]], however licenses were granted to the burghers in order to hunt large game wherever they chose\n\n=== Burgher Militia ===\n\nThe commissioner further instructed the Cape authorities to provide assistance to the free burghers not only for the sake of produce but in order to gain favour because of the assistance which they could present in time of war. During the time, in 1670, the free burghers constituted a company of militia eighty-nine strong.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:South Africa (1909) (14781850654).jpg|thumb|220px|French Huguenots building a house at the Cape]]\n\n=== Dutch Free Immigrants ===\n\nThe authorities of the East India Company had endeavoured to induce gardeners and small farmers to emigrate from Europe to South Africa, but with little success. Now and again they were able to send out to their eastern possessions a few families who were attracted by the tales of wealth. But the Cape had little charm in comparison. In October 1670, however, the Chamber of Amsterdam announced that a few families were willing to leave for the Cape and Mauritius during the following December. Among the new names of burghers at this time are found those of Jacob and Dirk van Niekerk, Johannes van As, Francois Villion, Jacob Brouwer, Jan van Eden, Hermanus Potgieter, Albertus Gildenhuis, and Jacobus van den Berg.<ref name=HisSA88-206 />\n\n=== French Huguenots ===\n\nDuring 1688\u20131689, the colony was greatly strengthened by the arrival of nearly two hundred French [[Huguenots]]. Political refugees from the religious wars in France, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], they were settled at [[Stellenbosch]], [[Drakenstein]], [[Franschhoek]] (\"French corner\") and [[Paarl]].<ref>H. C. Viljoen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091025222633/http://geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm The Contribution of the Huguenots in South Africa], 25 October 2009</ref> The influence of this small body of immigrants on the character of the Dutch settlers was marked. The Company in 1701 directed that only [[Dutch language|Dutch]] should be taught in the schools. This resulted in the Huguenots assimilating by the middle of the 18th century, with a loss to the community in the use and knowledge of [[French language|French]]. The little settlement gradually spread eastwards, and in 1754 the country as far as [[Algoa Bay]] was included in the colony.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cape Colony]]\n[[Category:History of South Africa]]\n\n[[Category:Settlers of South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "JalenFolf", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Removing link(s) to \"Europeans\":WP:OLINK.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\". Rhoads was inspired and chose this as the name of his band.<ref>Randy Rhoads: A Life, by David A. Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]]. Osbourne has stated in the ensuing years that he was immediately blown away by the guitarist's talent and hired him immediately.<ref name=\"I Am Ozzy\">{{cite book|last1=Osbourne|first1=Ozzy|title=I Am Ozzy|date=2009|publisher=Hachette Book Group, Inc.|location=237 Park Avenue New York, NY 10017|isbn=978-0-446-57313-9|page=100|edition=Jan 2010 eBook|url=http://www.125books.com/inc/pt4321/pt4322/pt4323/pt4324/pt4325/data_all%20books/x/x%20%20Osbourne%20%20Ozz%20I%20Am%20Ozzy%20kindle%20books.pdf|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, bassist Rudy Sarzo followed Rhoads to Osbourne's band and Quiet Riot's future seemed very much in doubt. As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest.

The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No.&nbsp;1 album in the same week.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their success was aided in no small part by the \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" video's heavy rotation on MTV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''Metal Health'' displaced [[The Police]]'s ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' at No.&nbsp;1 and stayed there for just a week until [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' took over the No.&nbsp;1 spot.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Metal Health'''s title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;31.

At one point he even compared his band to [[The Beatles]]. DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief.

Sarzo was permanently replaced in Quiet Riot by a reinstated Chuck Wright, after five years\u2019 absence from the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chuck Wright Interview|url= http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-wright-interview-quiet-riot/|publisher=Music Legends|accessdate=3 July 2013|date= 2008-06-05}}</ref> and the group temporarily added keyboardist [[John Purdell]] for their 1986 tour. That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot. Kevin DuBrow subsequently fought in court to keep control of the band's name.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Reformation and ''Metal Health'' lineup reunion (1990\u20132003)===\nHaving won the rights to the band's name, DuBrow teamed up with 21-year-old English born blues guitarist Sean Manning, bassist Kenny Hillery, and drummer Pat Ashby to reform Quiet Riot. Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''.

They eventually formed the band Heat in 1991 with bassist Kenny Hillery and drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]]. This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996. ''Greatest Hits'' covered only material from the CBS years, including three tracks from the 1988 album with Shortino and two previously promo-only live tracks.

I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\". Rhoads was inspired and chose this as the name of his band.<ref>Randy Rhoads: A Life, by David A. Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]].

As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest.

Rhoads gave him his blessing but said he wanted to check with Rudy Sarzo first.

Rhoads' mother Delores encouraged the band,<ref name=\"SarzoMemoir\" /> and in the end it was decided that \"although Randy wouldn't be in it, the original spirit of the band was back,\" according to Sarzo.<ref name=\"juke/ref\" />\n\nIn September 1982, with help from producer [[Pasha Records|Spencer Proffer]], Quiet Riot finally signed a US recording contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] and the album ''[[Metal Health]]'' was released on March 11, 1983. The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No.&nbsp;1 album in the same week.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their success was aided in no small part by the \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" video's heavy rotation on MTV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''Metal Health'' displaced [[The Police]]'s ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' at No.&nbsp;1 and stayed there for just a week until [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' took over the No.&nbsp;1 spot.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Metal Health'''s title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;31.

DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief.

That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot.

Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''.

This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996.

On January 14, 2008, Banali issued the following statement via his website regarding the future of Quiet Riot:\n\n<blockquote>I have been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting Rudy Sarzo and Carlos Cavazo and to audition singers for Quiet Riot. I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace. I now begin life after Quiet Riot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frankie-banali.com/homepage.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119203829/http://frankie-banali.com/homepage.html |archivedate=2008-01-19 |title=Frankie Banali statement |publisher=frankie-banali.com |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=May 14, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Revival with multiple vocalists (2010\u2013present)===\nDespite his previous insistence that Quiet Riot could never return as a live performing entity, Banali announced a new version of Quiet Riot in September 2010 with himself on drums, Chuck Wright on bass, Alex Grossi on guitar, and newcomer Mark Huff (formerly of the [[Van Halen]] tribute band 5150) on vocals.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/146974 |title=New Quiet Riot vocalist Mark Huff - \"I knew this was going to be an emotional thing on a lot of levels\" |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date= September 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> The band has sought the blessings of the DuBrow family, and DuBrow's mother encouraged Banali to revive the band.<ref>Well Now You're Here, There's No Way Back - Documentary Movie</ref> In July 2011, this lineup toured Germany as support for [[Slayer]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/146270 |title=Quiet Riot back in business with new singer |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 2012, whilst Huff was awaiting brain surgery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/01/13/quiet-riot-mark-huff/ |title=Ex-Quiet Riot singer Mark Huff responds to yesterday's firing |author=Amy Sciarretto|website=Noisecreep.com |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref> Quiet Riot released a statement, announcing that they had parted ways with Huff, and they were replacing him for upcoming dates with Keith St. John (formerly of [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]]).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/175872 |title=Quiet Riot part ways with singer Mark Huff; former Montrose vocalist Keith St. John fills in for upcoming live dates |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Huff found out about his firing online.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/182248 |title=Former Quiet Riot singer Mark Huff says he found about his firing online |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref> In March 2012, Banali hired unknown vocalist Scott Vokoun to fully replace Huff.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/179859 |title=Quiet Riot introduce new vocalist Scott Vokoun |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOriginal bassist and founding member Kelly Garni released his long-awaited autobiography in October 2012.

Banali said of the song choices: \n\n<blockquote>I made a conscious decision not to use the usual songs that people would expect. I picked tracks that were special and of the moment. Let's just say that there will be a familiar track, two unexpected choices and one that really shows the roots of Quiet Riot and how the band interacted in the live arena.
