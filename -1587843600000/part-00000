analysis of 160 early coronavirus genomes sampled from December 2019 to February 2020 revealed that the virus type most closely related to the bat coronavirus was most abundant in [[Guangdong]],

The predominant type among samples from Wuhan, \"B\", is more distantly related to the bat coronavirus than the ancestral type \"A\".<ref name=\"PNAS2020\" /><ref name=\"CU2020\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]]. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The [[pangolin]] coronavirus has up to 92% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" />\n\nBats were initially considered to be the most likely [[natural reservoir]] of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus sampled at the time and SARS-CoV-2 suggested that humans were infected via an intermediate host. Arinjay Banerjee at [[McMaster University]] notes that \"the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS virus]] shared 99.8% of its genome with a [[civet]] coronavirus, which is why civets were considered the source.\"<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> Although studies had suggested some likely candidates, the number and identities of intermediate hosts remains uncertain.<ref name=\"IJID-interm-host\" /> Nearly half of the strain's genome had a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.<ref name=\"Rejects\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, [[South China Agricultural University]] in [[Guangzhou]] announced that researchers had discovered a pangolin sample with a single viral [[nucleic acid]] sequence \"99% similar\" to that of a protein-coding [[RNA]] of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> The authors state that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\" The S protein, or [[Peplomer|spike protein]], of the virus binds to the [[Cell surface receptor|cell surface receptor]] during infection.<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nRecent phylogenetic analysis supports the notion that pangolins are a potential reservoir host. However, there is no evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host at this moment. While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that a SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus originated in pangolins, jumped back to bats, and then jumped to humans, resulting in SARS-CoV-2.

name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.<ref name=\"LancetLoad\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from [[asymptomatic]] cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic [[Viral shedding|shedding]] may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" /> Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the greatest amount of

/><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" /> A phylogenetic network analysis of 160 early coronavirus genomes sampled from December 2019 to February 2020 revealed that the virus type most closely related to the bat coronavirus was most abundant in [[Guangdong]],

The predominant type among samples from Wuhan, \"B\", is more distantly related to the bat coronavirus than the ancestral type \"A\".<ref name=\"PNAS2020\" /><ref name=\"CU2020\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]]. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The [[pangolin]] coronavirus has up to 92% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" />\n\nBats were initially considered to be the most likely [[natural reservoir]] of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus sampled at the time and SARS-CoV-2 suggested that humans were infected via an intermediate host. Arinjay Banerjee at [[McMaster University]] notes that \"the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS virus]] shared 99.8% of its genome with a [[civet]] coronavirus, which is why civets were considered the source.\"<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> Although studies had suggested some likely candidates, the number and identities of intermediate hosts remains uncertain.<ref name=\"IJID-interm-host\" /> Nearly half of the strain's genome had a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.<ref name=\"Rejects\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, [[South China Agricultural University]] in [[Guangzhou]] announced that researchers had discovered a pangolin sample with a single viral [[nucleic acid]] sequence \"99% similar\" to that of a protein-coding [[RNA]] of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> The authors state that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\" The S protein, or [[Peplomer|spike protein]], of the virus binds to the [[Cell surface receptor|cell surface receptor]] during infection.<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nRecent phylogenetic analysis supports the notion that pangolins are a potential reservoir host. However, there is no evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host at this moment. While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that a SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus originated in pangolins, jumped back to bats, and then jumped to humans, resulting in SARS-CoV-2. Based on whole genome sequence similarity, a highly similar pangolin coronavirus candidate strain was found to be less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 but are more similar than other bat coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> Therefore, based on [[maximum parsimony]], a specific population of bats is more likely to have directly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans than a pangolin, while an evolutionary ancestor to bats was the source of general coronaviruses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/coronavirusfrontlines/2020/04/17/a-virologist-explains-why-it-is-unlikely-covid-19-escaped-from-a-lab/ |title=A Virologist Explains Why It Is Unlikely COVID-19 Escaped From A Lab |last=Jason Kindrachuk |publisher=Forbes.com |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Microbiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n| caption = [[Genomic]] organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of SARS-CoV-2\n| type    = nucleotide\n| taxId   = MN908947\n| size    = 29,903 bases\n| year    = 2020\n}}\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as [[coronavirus]]es.<ref name = \"Fox2020\" /> It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment.

It stars [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Lee Sun-kyun]], [[Cho Yeo-jeong]], [[Choi Woo-shik]], [[Park So-dam]], [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]], and [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] and follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\n''Parasite'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2019, where it became the first South Korean film to win the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was then released in South Korea by [[CJ Entertainment]] on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe film received unanimous critical acclaim and was considered by many critics as the best film of 2019 as well as one of the best films of the 2010s. It grossed over $266 million worldwide on a production budget of about $11 million, becoming [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea#Domestic films by gross|the highest-grossing South Korean film]].

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo take over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the daughter of the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs. Park hires him, and decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners and flicks the light everyday hoping Ki-woo will see it one day. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* Michael Marcanio as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor.

Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners and flicks the light everyday hoping Ki-woo will see it one day. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor.

This extension of the East Pacific Rise is often referred to as the [[Gulf of California Rift Zone]].  The Gulf would extend as far as [[Indio, California]], except for the tremendous [[river delta|delta]] created by the [[Colorado River]]. This delta blocks the sea from flooding the [[Mexicali]] and [[Imperial Valley]]s. Volcanism dominates the [[East Pacific Rise]].

Most of the islands are found on the peninsular side of the gulf. In fact, many of the islands of the Sea of Cortez are the result of volcanic explosions that occurred during the early history of Baja California. The islands of [[Islas Mar\u00edas]], Islas San Francisco, and [[Isla Partida]] are thought to be the result of such explosions. The formations of the islands, however, are not dependent on each other. They were each formed as a result of an individual structural occurrence.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> Several islands, including [[Isla Coronados]], are home to volcanoes.\n\nThe gulf has more than 900 islets and islands which together total about 420 hectares. All of them as a whole were enacted as \"Area Reserve and Migratory Bird Refuge and Wildlife\" on August 2, 1978. In June 2000, the islands were given a new category \"Protection Area Wildlife\". In addition to this effort by the Mexican government, for its importance and recognition worldwide, all islands in the Gulf of California are also part of the international program \"Man and Biosphere\" (MAB) and are part of the World Reserve Network UNESCO Biosphere as Special Biosphere Reserve. Due to the vast expanse covered by this federal protected area conservation and management is carried out through a system of four regional directorates (one per bordering the Gulf of California state) by way of co-direction. There is a regional directorate in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora and Sinaloa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the work of direct and indirect conservation is done in the islands is governed by a single Management Program, published in 2000, which is complemented by local and specific management programs (at individuals) archipelagos. The Directorate of Protection Area Wildlife California Gulf Islands (APFF-GCR) in Baja California is responsible for 56 islands located off the coast of the state.

Some of the rich biodiversity and high [[endemism]] that characterize the Gulf of California and make it such a hotspot for fishing can be attributed to seemingly insignificant factors, such as the types of rocks that make up a shore. Beaches with softer, more porous rocks (such as Coquina limestone, rhyolites, granite, or diorite) generally have a higher species richness than those with harder, smoother rocks (such as basalt or diabase). Porous rocks will naturally have more cracks and crevices in them, making them ideal living spaces for many animals. The rocks themselves, however, generally need to be stable on the shore for a habitat to be stable. Additionally, the color of the rocks can affect the organisms living on a shore. For example, darker rocks will be significantly warmer than lighter ones, and can deter animals that do not have a high tolerance for heat.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\nThe northern Gulf of California experiences tidal ranges of up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. Mixed [[semidiurnal tides]] are the norm throughout most of the Gulf.\n\n;Estuaries\nIn the Gulf of California, there are a number of negative [[estuary|estuaries]], that is, ones in which the [[evaporation]] of seawater is relatively greater than that of the fresh water input. The salinities of these inlets are higher than that of the [[ocean]]. The temperatures, [[Poikilotherm#Ecological niches|poikilothermal]], of these negative [[estuary|estuaries]] also are higher than the general temperature of the Gulf.\n\nIt is possible that at one time these estuaries were positive, that is, ones in which the [[seawater]] component is [[Concentration|diluted]]; therefore, the water is [[brackish water|brackish]], with salinity less than that of the ocean.\n\nHowever, due to human settlement around the Gulf of California and water diversion for municipal and agricultural use in an area of comparatively low rainfall, there are no longer many rivers that freely empty into the Gulf of California. The upper [[Colorado River Delta]] is one example of a historically major estuary and [[wetlands]] [[ecosystem]], that since the 20th century construction of upriver dams and diversion aqueducts on the [[Colorado River]], is now a small [[ephemeral]] remnant estuary. The remaining Gulf inlets still are important to several species of fishes, [[crustacean]]s, and [[shellfish]] that are commercially harvested.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Climate==\n;Air\nEven though the shores of the Gulf of California are generally sheltered from the continuous wave shock that is experienced by most other North American shores, storms known as a \"[[chubasco]]\" can cause significant damage to shorelines, despite their brevity.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n;Ocean\nThe depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> The temperature of the water in the Gulf of California generally experiences lows of {{convert|16|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winter and highs of {{convert|24|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summer. But temperatures can vary greatly in the gulf, and the water is almost always warmer by the coast than the open ocean. For example, the waters surrounding La Paz reach {{convert|30|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in August, while the waters in neighboring city Cabo San Lucas, only reach {{convert|26|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Nix\"/><ref name=\"deepmexico.com\">[http://www.deepmexico.com/es/ocean_dives.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221075834/http://www.deepmexico.com/es/ocean_dives.html |date=December 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"redalyc.uaemex.mx\">{{cite web |url=https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/479/47942204.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715160509/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/html/479/47942204/47942204.html |archivedate=2012-07-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/ftm/bajaPages/MarineBiology.html |title=Marine Biology of Baja California |publisher=Math.ucr.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally, the northern Gulf of California will go through significantly cold winters.

In addition to a wide range of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] creatures, such as the critically endangered [[vaquita]], it hosts many migratory species, such as the [[humpback whale]], [[California gray whale]], [[killer whale]], [[manta ray]], [[Humboldt squid]] and [[leatherback sea turtle]], and the world's largest animal, the [[blue whale]]. The unusual resident populations of [[fin whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s do not migrate annually. The area near the delta of the Colorado river has a small remnant population of the [[totoaba]] fish. This region has historically been a magnet for world-class sport [[fishing]] activities, with a rich history of sporting world records.\n\nThe region also has a rich history as a commercial [[fishery]]. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, and the Gulf's ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain. Moreover, changes in terrestrial ecology, such as the vast reduction in flow from the Colorado River into the Gulf, have negatively affected fisheries, particularly in the northern region.\n\nThe Gulf of California sustains a large number of marine mammals, many of which are rare and endangered. Its more than 900 islands are important nesting sites for thousands of seabirds, and its waters are primary breeding, feeding, and nursing grounds for myriad migratory and resident fish species. For decades, the gulf has been a primary source of two of Mexico's leading marine resources, sardines and anchovies. Water pollution is a problem in the Gulf of California, but the more immediate concerns are overfishing and bottom trawling, which destroys eelgrass beds and shellfish.\n\nEfforts by the Mexican government to create [[Conservation ethic|conservation zones]] and [[nature reserve]]s have been hampered by lack of enforcement resources, as well as a lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This occurs even though significant areas are a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures, much less strict measures of conservation. Conservation of the Gulf's fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of overcapitalization in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico's coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the Gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain. In 2019, the gulf was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of concerns of the imminent extinction of the [[vaquita]], an endemic porpoise in the area.<ref name=\"whs danger\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1999 |title=The Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California (Mexico) inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoastal communities are highly reliant on both commercial and sport fishing, including [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[San Carlos, Sonora]], [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], [[Guaymas]], [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], [[Topolobampo]] and [[Muleg\u00e9]]. The well-developed shrimp and sardine fleets of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], on the Mexican mainland's Pacific coast, heavily exploit the commercial fisheries of the southern Gulf.\n\nMany marine organisms can only survive within a particular [[salinity]] range, which makes salinity a notable factor in determining the types of potentially commercial organisms found in the Gulf of California. The mean annual ranges of salinity of the Sea of Cortez are between 3.5 and 3.58% at the surface.<ref name=\"Nix\"/> Furthermore, the salinity of the water of the Northern Gulf of California is generally higher than the Central and Southern faunal regions due to the increased amount of evaporation that occurs in that region.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of western shore communities on the Gulf of California]]\n* [[List of eastern shore communities on the Gulf of California]] \n* [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Brusca, Richard C.

Most of the islands are found on the peninsular side of the gulf. In fact, many of the islands of the Sea of Cortez are the result of volcanic explosions that occurred during the early history of Baja California. The islands of [[Islas Mar\u00edas]], Islas San Francisco, and [[Isla Partida]] are thought to be the result of such explosions.

All of them as a whole were enacted as \"Area Reserve and Migratory Bird Refuge and Wildlife\" on August 2, 1978. In June 2000, the islands were given a new category \"Protection Area Wildlife\". In addition to this effort by the Mexican government, for its importance and recognition worldwide, all islands in the Gulf of California are also part of the international program \"Man and Biosphere\" (MAB) and are part of the World Reserve Network UNESCO Biosphere as Special Biosphere Reserve.

Some of the rich biodiversity and high [[endemism]] that characterize the Gulf of California and make it such a hotspot for fishing can be attributed to seemingly insignificant factors, such as the types of rocks that make up a shore. Beaches with softer, more porous rocks (such as Coquina limestone, rhyolites, granite, or diorite) generally have a higher species richness than those with harder, smoother rocks (such as basalt or diabase). Porous rocks will naturally have more cracks and crevices in them, making them ideal living spaces for many animals. The rocks themselves, however, generally need to be stable on the shore for a habitat to be stable. Additionally, the color of the rocks can affect the organisms living on a shore. For example, darker rocks will be significantly warmer than lighter ones, and can deter animals that do not have a high tolerance for heat.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\nThe northern Gulf of California experiences tidal ranges of up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. Mixed [[semidiurnal tides]] are the norm throughout most of the Gulf.\n\n;Estuaries\nIn the Gulf of California, there are a number of negative [[estuary|estuaries]], that is, ones in which the [[evaporation]] of seawater is relatively greater than that of the fresh water input. The salinities of these inlets are higher than that of the [[ocean]]. The temperatures, [[Poikilotherm#Ecological niches|poikilothermal]], of these negative [[estuary|estuaries]] also are higher than the general temperature of the Gulf.\n\nIt is possible that at one time these estuaries were positive, that is, ones in which the [[seawater]] component is [[Concentration|diluted]]; therefore, the water is [[brackish water|brackish]], with salinity less than that of the ocean.\n\nHowever, due to human settlement around the Gulf of California and water diversion for municipal and agricultural use in an area of comparatively low rainfall, there are no longer many rivers that freely empty into the Gulf of California. The upper [[Colorado River Delta]] is one example of a historically major estuary and [[wetlands]] [[ecosystem]], that since the 20th century construction of upriver dams and diversion aqueducts on the [[Colorado River]], is now a small [[ephemeral]] remnant estuary. The remaining Gulf inlets still are important to several species of fishes, [[crustacean]]s, and [[shellfish]] that are commercially harvested.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n==Climate==\n;Air\nEven though the shores of the Gulf of California are generally sheltered from the continuous wave shock that is experienced by most other North American shores, storms known as a \"[[chubasco]]\" can cause significant damage to shorelines, despite their brevity.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n;Ocean\nThe depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> The temperature of the water in the Gulf of California generally experiences lows of {{convert|16|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winter and highs of {{convert|24|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summer. But temperatures can vary greatly in the gulf, and the water is almost always warmer by the coast than the open ocean. For example, the waters surrounding La Paz reach {{convert|30|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in August, while the waters in neighboring city Cabo San Lucas, only reach {{convert|26|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Nix\"/><ref name=\"deepmexico.com\">[http://www.deepmexico.com/es/ocean_dives.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221075834/http://www.deepmexico.com/es/ocean_dives.html |date=December 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"redalyc.uaemex.mx\">{{cite web |url=http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/html/479/47942204/47942204.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715160509/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/html/479/47942204/47942204.html |archivedate=2012-07-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/ftm/bajaPages/MarineBiology.html |title=Marine Biology of Baja California |publisher=Math.ucr.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally, the northern Gulf of California will go through significantly cold winters.

In addition to a wide range of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] creatures, such as the critically endangered [[vaquita]], it hosts many migratory species, such as the [[humpback whale]], [[California gray whale]], [[killer whale]], [[manta ray]], [[Humboldt squid]] and [[leatherback sea turtle]], and the world's largest animal, the [[blue whale]]. The unusual resident populations of [[fin whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s do not migrate annually. The area near the delta of the Colorado river has a small remnant population of the [[totoaba]] fish. This region has historically been a magnet for world-class sport [[fishing]] activities, with a rich history of sporting world records.\n\nThe region also has a rich history as a commercial [[fishery]]. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, and the Gulf's ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain. Moreover, changes in terrestrial ecology, such as the vast reduction in flow from the Colorado River into the Gulf, have negatively affected fisheries, particularly in the northern region.\n\nThe Gulf of California sustains a large number of marine mammals, many of which are rare and endangered. Its more than 900 islands are important nesting sites for thousands of seabirds, and its waters are primary breeding, feeding, and nursing grounds for myriad migratory and resident fish species. For decades, the gulf has been a primary source of two of Mexico's leading marine resources, sardines and anchovies. Water pollution is a problem in the Gulf of California, but the more immediate concerns are overfishing and bottom trawling, which destroys eelgrass beds and shellfish.\n\nEfforts by the Mexican government to create [[Conservation ethic|conservation zones]] and [[nature reserve]]s have been hampered by lack of enforcement resources, as well as a lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This occurs even though significant areas are a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures, much less strict measures of conservation. Conservation of the Gulf's fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of overcapitalization in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico's coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the Gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain. In 2019, the gulf was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of concerns of the imminent extinction of the [[vaquita]], an endemic porpoise in the area.<ref name=\"whs danger\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1999 |title=The Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California (Mexico) inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoastal communities are highly reliant on both commercial and sport fishing, including [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[San Carlos, Sonora]], [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], [[Guaymas]], [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], [[Topolobampo]] and [[Muleg\u00e9]]. The well-developed shrimp and sardine fleets of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], on the Mexican mainland's Pacific coast, heavily exploit the commercial fisheries of the southern Gulf.\n\nMany marine organisms can only survive within a particular [[salinity]] range, which makes salinity a notable factor in determining the types of potentially commercial organisms found in the Gulf of California. The mean annual ranges of salinity of the Sea of Cortez are between 3.5 and 3.58% at the surface.<ref name=\"Nix\"/> Furthermore, the salinity of the water of the Northern Gulf of California is generally higher than the Central and Southern faunal regions due to the increased amount of evaporation that occurs in that region.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of western shore communities on the Gulf of California]]\n* [[List of eastern shore communities on the Gulf of California]] \n* [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Brusca, Richard C.
