Tagine is now often eaten with [[french fries]], either on the top or on the side.\n\nToday, the cooking-pot and its traditional broth are primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa. In North Africa, it is called a tajine, while in the Middle East it is called a ''maraq'' (broth) or a ''qidra'' (cooking pot). There are different ways to prepare the tajine. In the original qidra style, ''saman'' ([[clarified butter]]) is used to lubricate the surface and a puree of chopped onion is added for flavour and aroma. For ''muqawlli''-style cooking, the ingredients are placed in [[olive oil]] to enrich the flavours.\n\nThere are many descriptions of how to prepare a tajine from Arab scholars. A famous description is the one from [[ibn al-Adim]] (1192\u20131262):\n{{quotation |text=Boil the meat and fry with fresh coriander, onions and hot spices and a little garlic. Then pick out the fennel hearts and cut in half. Put over the meat. Put back some of the broth on it along with sheep's tail. Boil until cooked and the broth has been absorbed. Remove [from the heat].|author=[[Ibn al-Adim]] |title=''Kitab Al Wuslah il Al-Habib fi wasf al tayyibat wa Al-Tib''}}\n\n==Pottery==\nThe traditional tajine [[pottery]], sometimes painted or [[ceramic glaze|glazed]], consists of two parts: a circular base unit that is flat with low sides and a large cone- or dome-shaped cover that sits on the base during cooking. The cover is designed to return all [[condensation]] to the bottom. That process can be improved by adding cold water into the specially designed well at the top of the lid.\n\nTajine is traditionally cooked over hot charcoal leaving an adequate space between the coals and the tajine pot to avoid having the temperature rise too quickly. Large bricks of charcoal are used, specifically for their ability to stay hot for hours.  Other methods are to use a tajine in a slow oven or on a gas or electric stove top, on the lowest heat necessary to keep the stew simmering gently. A [[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]], a circular utensil placed between the tajine and the flame, is used to evenly distribute the stove's heat. European manufacturers have created tajines with heavy [[cast-iron]] bottoms that can be heated on a cooking stove to a high temperature, which permits the browning of meat and vegetables before cooking.\n\nTajine cooking may be replicated by using a [[slow cooker]] or similar item, but the result will be slightly different{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  Many ceramic tajines are decorative items as well as functional cooking vessels. Some tajines, however, are intended only to be used as decorative serving dishes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:Tajine potter.jpg|Tajine potter\nFile:Kelaa-des-Mgouna (rosino-02).jpg|Tajine cooking\nFile:ElectricalTajine3.jpg|Electrical tajine\nFile:Cascades d'Ouzoud 015.JPG|Tajine used outdoors\n</gallery>\n\n== Moroccan and Algerian tajine ==\n\nMoroccan and Algerian tajine dishes are slow-cooked savory stews, typically made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or fruit.<ref name=\"Long2015\">{{cite book|author=Lucy M.

Common spices include [[ginger]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[cinnamon]], and [[saffron]]. [[Paprika]] and chili are used in vegetable tajines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tajine dishes like lamb with dates and spices. Tajines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tajine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is important in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:IB tajine 03.jpg|Lamb, prunes and almonds\nFile:Marrakech 024.JPG|Lamb with plum and eggs\nFile:Tajine 004.JPG|Tajine with olives and vegetables\nFile:Tajine 013.JPG|Tajine\nFile:Tajin aux pruneaux.JPG|Tajine with almonds\nFile:Tajine 014.JPG|Tajine with carrots\nFile:Tajine mangue.JPG|Tajine with lamb and mango\nFile:Tajine 026.JPG|Tajine with chicken\n</gallery>\n\n==Tunisian tajine==\n[[Image:Tajine tunisien.JPG|thumb|Tunisian tajine]]\nWhat Tunisians refer to as a \"tajine\" is very different from the Moroccan dish.<ref name=\"Wolfert-Tunisian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paula-wolfert.com/recipes/tun_tagine.html|author=Paula Wolfert|title=Recipe for Tunisian Tajine|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisian]] tajine is more like an Italian [[frittata]] or an [[eggah]]. First, a simple [[ragout]] is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried [[rose]][[bud]]s and ground cinnamon known as ''[[baharat]]'' or a robust combination of ground [[coriander]] and [[caraway]] seeds; this is called [[tabil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/divine-secrets-of-the-mahjoub-sisterhood|author=Nancy Harmon Jenkins|title=Divine Secrets of the Mahjoub Sisterhood|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include [[cannellini bean]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[breadcrumb]]s or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh [[parsley]], dried [[Mentha|mint]], [[saffron]], [[sun-dried tomato]]es, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew are baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of [[lemon]]. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.\n\nIn rural parts of Tunisia, home cooks place a shallow earthenware dish over olive-wood coals, fill it, cover it with a flat earthenware pan, and then pile hot coals on top. The resulting tajine is crusty on top and bottom, moist within and is infused with a subtle smoky fragrance.\n[[File:Md.Boualam Tajine,Outdoor cooking.jpg|thumb|[[Outdoor cooking]] using a tajine]]\n\n==Sephardi Jewish tagine==\n\n[[Sephardi]] and [[Maghrebi Jews]] also eat and prepare tagine, owing to their presence in North Africa going back several thousand years.

Tagine is now often eaten with [[french fries]], either on the top or on the side.\n\nToday, the cooking-pot and its traditional broth are primarily prepared in the Middle East and North Africa. In North Africa, it is called a tajine, while in the Middle East it is called a ''maraq'' (broth) or a ''qidra'' (cooking pot). There are different ways to prepare the tajine. In the original qidra style, ''saman'' ([[clarified butter]]) is used to lubricate the surface and a puree of chopped onion is added for flavour and aroma. For ''muqawlli''-style cooking, the ingredients are placed in [[olive oil]] to enrich the flavours.\n\nThere are many descriptions of how to prepare a tajine from Arab scholars. A famous description is the one from [[ibn al-Adim]] (1192\u20131262):\n{{quotation |text=Boil the meat and fry with fresh coriander, onions and hot spices and a little garlic. Then pick out the fennel hearts and cut in half. Put over the meat. Put back some of the broth on it along with sheep's tail. Boil until cooked and the broth has been absorbed. Remove [from the heat].|author=[[Ibn al-Adim]] |title=''Kitab Al Wuslah il Al-Habib fi wasf al tayyibat wa Al-Tib''}}\n\n==Pottery==\nThe traditional tajine [[pottery]], sometimes painted or [[ceramic glaze|glazed]], consists of two parts: a circular base unit that is flat with low sides and a large cone- or dome-shaped cover that sits on the base during cooking. The cover is designed to return all [[condensation]] to the bottom. That process can be improved by adding cold water into the specially designed well at the top of the lid.\n\nTajine is traditionally cooked over hot charcoal leaving an adequate space between the coals and the tajine pot to avoid having the temperature rise too quickly. Large bricks of charcoal are used, specifically for their ability to stay hot for hours.  Other methods are to use a tajine in a slow oven or on a gas or electric stove top, on the lowest heat necessary to keep the stew simmering gently. A [[Diffuser (heat)|diffuser]], a circular utensil placed between the tajine and the flame, is used to evenly distribute the stove's heat. European manufacturers have created tajines with heavy [[cast-iron]] bottoms that can be heated on a cooking stove to a high temperature, which permits the browning of meat and vegetables before cooking.\n\nTajine cooking may be replicated by using a [[slow cooker]] or similar item, but the result will be slightly different{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  Many ceramic tajines are decorative items as well as functional cooking vessels. Some tajines, however, are intended only to be used as decorative serving dishes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:Tajine potter.jpg|Tajine potter\nFile:Kelaa-des-Mgouna (rosino-02).jpg|Tajine cooking\nFile:ElectricalTajine3.jpg|Electrical tajine\nFile:Cascades d'Ouzoud 015.JPG|Tajine used outdoors\n</gallery>\n\n== Moroccan and Algerian tajine ==\n\nMoroccan and Algerian tajine dishes are slow-cooked savory stews, typically made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or fruit.<ref name=\"Long2015\">{{cite book|author=Lucy M.

Common spices include [[ginger]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[cinnamon]], and [[saffron]]. [[Paprika]] and chili are used in vegetable tajines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tajine dishes like lamb with dates and spices. Tajines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tajine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is important in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:IB tajine 03.jpg|Lamb, prunes and almonds\nFile:Marrakech 024.JPG|Lamb with plum and eggs\nFile:Tajine 004.JPG|Tajine with olives and vegetables\nFile:Tajine 013.JPG|Tajine\nFile:Tajin aux pruneaux.JPG|Tajine with almonds\nFile:Tajine 014.JPG|Tajine with carrots\nFile:Tajine mangue.JPG|Tajine with lamb and mango\nFile:Tajine 026.JPG|Tajine with chicken\n</gallery>\n\n==Tunisian tajine==\n[[Image:Tajine tunisien.JPG|thumb|Tunisian tajine]]\nWhat Tunisians refer to as a \"tajine\" is very different from the Moroccan dish.<ref name=\"Wolfert-Tunisian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paula-wolfert.com/recipes/tun_tagine.html|author=Paula Wolfert|title=Recipe for Tunisian Tajine|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisian]] tajine is more like an Italian [[frittata]] or an [[eggah]]. First, a simple [[ragout]] is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried [[rose]][[bud]]s and ground cinnamon known as ''[[baharat]]'' or a robust combination of ground [[coriander]] and [[caraway]] seeds; this is called [[tabil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/divine-secrets-of-the-mahjoub-sisterhood|author=Nancy Harmon Jenkins|title=Divine Secrets of the Mahjoub Sisterhood|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include [[cannellini bean]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[breadcrumb]]s or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh [[parsley]], dried [[Mentha|mint]], [[saffron]], [[sun-dried tomato]]es, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew are baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of [[lemon]]. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.\n\nIn rural parts of Tunisia, home cooks place a shallow earthenware dish over olive-wood coals, fill it, cover it with a flat earthenware pan, and then pile hot coals on top. The resulting tajine is crusty on top and bottom, moist within and is infused with a subtle smoky fragrance.\n[[File:Md.Boualam Tajine,Outdoor cooking.jpg|thumb|[[Outdoor cooking]] using a tajine]]\n\n==Sephardi Jewish tagine==\n\n[[Sephardi]] and [[Maghrebi Jews]] also eat and prepare tagine, owing to their presence in North Africa going back several thousand years.

Russell, like Trussell, appears to have originally come from England, but when he returned in 1925, he is recorded as having come back from England.

Shortly after this, in May 1907, he and his wife were farewelled from Waihi where the town presented him with a marble clock in recognition of the contribution made to the town. Silver hair brushes were presented to his wife. In the press and in band circles, Trussell had become known as \"the New Zealand March King\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1907\">[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers \"Papers Past\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322202822/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers |date=22 March 2017 }} Trussell described as New Zealand March King and N.

Russell used for composing purposes. It seems this is a misunderstanding and that Charles Trussell and T. Russell appear to be two different people, as both apparently were conducting different bands in different places at the same time. Mr. T. Russell, like Trussell, appears to have originally come from England, but when he returned in 1925, he is recorded as having come back from England. He also apparently returned to England due to ill health. Charles Trussell would have been both coming from and returning to Australia rather than England at this time.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Return to Australia===\nIn 1907 Trussell moved back to Australia, this time settling in [[Ipswich, Queensland]].  He was appointed conductor of the [[Ipswich Vice-Regal Band]], a position he held until his retirement in 1923.

L|publisher=palgrave macmillan|year=1955|isbn=978-1403908131|page=241}}</ref> The war was punctuated by widely separated battles, and began with England's military expedition in 1585 to what was then the [[Spanish Netherlands]] under the command of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] in support of the resistance of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] to [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] rule.\n\nThe English enjoyed some victories at [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard|C\u00e1diz]] in 1587, and saw the [[Spanish Armada]] retreat in 1588, but then suffered severe defeats of the [[English Armada]] in 1589 and the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Drake\u2013Hawkins]] and [[Islands Voyage|Essex\u2013Raleigh]] expeditions in 1595 and 1597 respectively. Two further Spanish armadas were sent in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]] but were frustrated in their objectives mainly because of adverse weather and poor planning.\n\nThe war became deadlocked around the turn of the 17th century during campaigns in the [[Eighty Years' War (1566\u20131609)|Netherlands]], [[French Wars of Religion|France]] and [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Ireland]]. It was brought to an end with the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], negotiated in 1604 between representatives of the new King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], and the new King of England, [[James I of England|James I]]. England and Spain agreed to cease their military interventions in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas [[privateering]].\n\n== Causes ==\nIn the 1560s, [[Philip II of Spain]] was faced with increasing religious disturbances as [[Protestantism]] gained adherents in his domains in the [[Low Countries]]. As a defender of the [[Catholic Church]], he sought to suppress the rising Protestant movement in his territories, which eventually exploded into [[Dutch Revolt|open rebellion]] in 1566.  Meanwhile, relations with the regime of [[Elizabeth I of England]] continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the [[Church of England]] through the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and rescinded by her sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Philip's wife. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority.  Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in [[France]], which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Opposing Monarchs\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Philipp II Spanien MATEO.jpg|<center><br />[[Philip II of Spain]]</center>\nFile:Elisabeth I England MATEO.jpg|<center><br />[[Elizabeth I of England]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nComplicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins's trade with their colonies in the [[West Indies]] constituted [[smuggling]]. In September 1568, a slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir [[Francis Drake]] was surprised by the Spanish, and several ships were captured or sunk at the [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa]] near [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in [[New Spain]]. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their [[privateering]] as a way to break the Spanish [[monopoly]] on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage where he eventually [[Francis Drake#Circumnavigation of the earth (1577\u20131580)|circumnavigated the globe]] between 1577 and 1580. Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured including the treasure galleon ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n]]''. When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth's relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]], English support was provided to [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Prior of Crato]] who then fought [[War of the Portuguese Succession|in his struggle]] with Philip II for the [[Portugal|Portuguese throne]]. Philip in return began to support the [[Second Desmond Rebellion|Catholic rebellion in Ireland]] against Elizabeth's religious reforms. Both Philip's and Elizabeth's attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.\n\nIn 1584, Philip signed the [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]] to stop the rise of [[French Wars of Religion|Protestantism there]]. In the [[Spanish Netherlands]], England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], who were [[Eighty Years War|fighting for independence]] from Spain. In 1584, the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the [[Fall of Antwerp|capture of Antwerp]] by Spanish forces led by [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma]]. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England.<ref>Tracey pp.157-58</ref> The [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] was signed as a result \u2013 Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies but she declined overall sovereignty. In return, the Dutch handed over four [[Cautionary Towns]] which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.\n\n== War ==\nThe Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of [[Spanish Company|English merchant ships]] in Spanish harbors. In response the English [[Privy Council of England|privy council]] immediately authorised [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|a campaign]] against the Spanish fishing industry in [[Newfoundland]] and off the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].<ref name=\"Bicheno\">Bicheno p 180</ref> The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England's first sustained activity in the Americas.<ref>[[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIp7_e8KMJ0C&pg=PA31&#v=onepage&q&f=false The Jamestown Project]</ref> In August, England joined the [[Eighty Years' War#Secession and reconquest (1579\u20131588)|Eighty Years' War]] on the side of the Dutch Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], which had declared their independence from Spain.\n\nThe Queen through [[Francis Walsingham]] ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] in a kind of [[preemptive strike]]. Drake sailed in October to the [[West Indies]], and in January 1586 [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|captured and sacked Santo Domingo]]. The following month they did the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|same at Cartagena de Indias]] and in May sailed North [[Raid on St. Augustine|to raid St. Augustine]] in [[Florida]]. When Drake arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain however, the news was a disaster and this now further buoyed a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip.<ref name=\"Konstam\">Konstam p.76-77</ref>\n\n=== Dutch Revolt (1585\u20131587) ===\n[[File:Siege of Grave - Beleg van Grave door de Prins van Parma (1586).jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Grave (1586)|Siege of Grave]] in 1586]]\n[[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester]] was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offer of Governor of the United Provinces. This, however, was met with fury from Elizabeth who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir [[John Norreys]]. They combined forces but were undermanned and under financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma]].<ref>Hammer 2003 pp. 125\u2013127</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Grave (1586)|siege of Grave]] the following year Dudley attempted its relief but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave's sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 282\u2013284</ref> The English force then had some successes - [[Capture of Axel|taking Axel]] in July and [[Doesburg]] the following month. Dudley's poor diplomacy with the Dutch however made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation.<ref name=\"t' Hart\">t' Hart p.21-22</ref> Outside [[Zutphen]] an English force [[Battle of Zutphen|was defeated]] in which notable poet [[Philip Sidney]] was mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and [[Deventer]] were betrayed by catholic [[turncoat]]s [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] and [[Rowland York]] which further damaged Leicester's reputation. Finally [[Sluis]] with a largely English garrison [[Siege of Sluis (1587)|was besieged and taken]] by the Duke of Parma in June 1587 after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 291\u2013294</ref>\n\nLeicester soon realised how dire his situation was and then asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as Governor - his tenure was a military and political failure, and as a result, he was financially ruined.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 294\u2013295</ref> After Leicester's departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange's son Count [[Maurice of Nassau]] as the [[Stadtholder]] and Governor. At the same time [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Peregrine Bertie]] took over English forces in the Netherlands.\n\n=== Spanish Armada ===\n{{main|Spanish Armada|Spanish Armada in Ireland}}\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Invincible Armada'', National Maritime Museum, London]]\n\nOn 8 February 1587, the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] outraged Catholics in Europe, and her claim on the English throne passed (by her own deed of will) to Philip. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip's preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard|burned 37 Spanish ships]] in the harbour of [[C\u00e1diz]], and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.\n\nOn 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by [[Pope Pius V]], and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors. To finance this endeavour, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.<ref>{{Cite CE1913 |wstitle=Spanish Armada |first=John Hungerford |last=Pollen |volume=1}}\"Pope Sixtus V agreed to renew the excommunication of the Queen, and to grant a large subsidy to the Armada, but, knowing the slowness of Spain, would give nothing till the expedition should actually land in England. In this way, he was saved his million crowns, and spared the reproach of having taken futile proceedings against the heretic queen.\"</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 1588, the Armada under the command of [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English channel, the English navy led by [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] and Francis Drake fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from [[Plymouth]] to [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] and then to the [[Solent]], preventing them from securing any English harbours.<ref name=\"Hanson\">Hanson p. 379</ref> The Spanish were forced to withdraw to [[Calais]]. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent [[Spanish Armada#Battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]] the English navy inflicted a defeat on the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around [[Scotland]], the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.<ref name=\"ParkerMartin\">Parker & Martin p. 215</ref>\n\nPhilip's invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The defeat of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II's enemies in the Netherlands and [[France]], these efforts brought few tangible rewards.<ref name=\"Holmes 2001, p. 858.\">Richard Holmes 2001, p. 858: \"The 1588 campaign was a major English propaganda victory, but in strategic terms, it was essentially indecisive.\"</ref> One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada's failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the [[Latin]]/[[Hebrew]] inscription ''Flavit \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 et Dissipati Sunt'' (literally: \"[[Yahweh]] blew and they were scattered\"; traditionally translated more freely as: \"[[He blew with His winds, and they were scattered]]\".)\n\n=== English Armada ===\n{{main|English Armada}}\n[[File:Maria Pita, A Coru\u00f1a 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Statue of [[Maria Pita]] at Coruna]]\n\nAn English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir [[John Norreys]] was prepared in 1589 to torch the Spanish Atlantic navy, which was refitting in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in northern Spain. It was also intended to capture the incoming [[Spanish treasure fleet]] and expel the Spanish from Portugal (ruled by Philip since 1580) in favour of the Prior of Crato. The English fleet departed from&nbsp;Plymouth&nbsp;on&nbsp;April 13 but was then delayed for nearly two weeks by bad weather. Drake, as a result, had to bypass Santander where the majority of the Spanish fleet were being refitted.\n\nOn May 4, the English force eventually arrived at Corunna where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norreys then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed. In addition, a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces. With the failure to capture Corunna the English departed and headed towards [[Lisbon]], but owing to poor organisation and lack of co-ordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving the English retreated and headed North where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Sickness then struck the expedition, and finally, a portion of the fleet led by Drake headed towards the [[Azores]], which was then scattered in a storm. Drake then took the best part of the fleet and plundered [[Porto Santo]] in [[Madeira]] before they limped back to Plymouth.<ref>R. B. Wernham, 'Queen Elizabeth and the Portugal Expedition of 1589: Part II', ''English Historical Review'', 66/259 (April 1951), pp. 204 - 14</ref>\n\nThe English Armada was arguably misconceived and ended in failure overall. In the end, Elizabeth sustained a severe loss to her treasury.\n\n=== Dutch Revolt (1588\u20131595) ===\nSoon after the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]], the Duke of Parma's force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards [[Bergen op Zoom]] and then attempted to [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1588)|besiege the English-held town]] with a substantial force. The English in a [[Ruse de guerre|ruse]] however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma's retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book|last1=[[Charles Maurice Davies]]|title=The History of Holland and the Dutch nation: from the beginning of the tenth century to the end of the eighteenth|date=1851|publisher=G.

In a remarkable feat, a small assault force hid in a peat [[barge]] before a [[Capture of Breda (1590)|successful surprise assault]] that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started the gradual recapture of the Netherlands. This was known by the Dutch as the 'Ten glory years'. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch  [[Siege of Zutphen (1591)|retook Zutphen]] and [[Siege of Deventer (1591)|Deventer]] which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma [[Siege of Knodsenburg|at Knodsenberg]] in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with [[Siege of Hulst (1591)|Hulst]], [[Siege of Nijmegen (1591)|Nijmegen]], [[Siege of Geertruidenberg (1593)|Geertruidenberg]], [[Siege of Steenwijk (1592)|Steenwijk]] and [[Siege of Coevorden (1592)|Coevorden]] all being taken within the next two years.<ref name=\"Knight\"/> In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by [[Francisco Verdugo]] to recapture Coevorden [[Siege of Coevorden (1593)|ended in failure]] when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the Spring of 1594. Finally, the [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|capture of Groningen]] in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the Northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.<ref name=\"HadHam\">Hadfield & Hammond p.49</ref>\n\nAfter these successes, Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crowns expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.\n\nIn 1595, Maurice's campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the [[Twente]] region from the Spanish. This was delayed after [[Huy]] was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent [[Siege of Huy (1595)|its fall]]. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to [[Siege of Groenlo (1595)|take Grol]] in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under a 90-year-old veteran [[Crist\u00f3bal de Mondrag\u00f3n]] relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of [[Rheinberg]] in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the [[Battle of the Lippe]]. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. The Spanish under the new commander [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] took advantage of this lull and [[Siege of Hulst (1596)|recaptured Hulst]] the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===Naval War and Privateering===\n[[File:The Last fight of the Revenge off Flores in the Azores 1591 by Charles Dixon.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Last fight of the Revenge'' off Flores in the Azores 1591]]\nIn this period of respite, the Spanish were able to refit and retool their navy, partly along English lines. The pride of the fleet were named ''The Twelve Apostles'' \u2013 twelve massive new [[galleon]]s \u2013 and the navy proved itself to be far more effective than it had been before 1588. A sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence networks frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the [[Azores]], who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish [[Battle of Flores (1591)|captured]] the English flagship, the ''[[HMS Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'', after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir [[Richard Grenville]]. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.\n\nEnglish merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth's [[Sea Dogs|''Sea dogs'']] however enjoyed more qualified success.<ref name=\"Andrews124\">Andrews p. 124-25</ref> In the three years after the Spanish armada more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over \u00a3400,000.<ref name=\"Bicheno320\">Bicheno p. 320</ref> English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profit - his first being the [[Azores Voyage of 1589|Azores Voyage in 1589]]. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with [[Battle of Berlengas Islands|Spanish galleys off Berlengas]]. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and [[Martin Frobisher]] combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] island in 1592 in [[Battle of Flores (1592)|a naval battle]] the English fleet captured a large rich Portuguese carrack, the [[Madre de Deus]] as well as having outwitted a Spanish fleet led by [[Alonso de Baz\u00e1n]]. The expedition's reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England's royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment.<ref name=\"Andrews73\">Andrews p 73</ref> These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[John Ramsay McCulloch|McCulloch, John Ramsay]] |title=A Treatise on the Principles, Practice, & History of Commerce|date=1833|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|page=[https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonprin00goog/page/n138 120]|url=https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonprin00goog}}</ref> Raleigh himself in 1595 went on [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|an expedition to explore]] the [[Orinoco river]] in an attempt to find the mythical city of [[El Dorado]] in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad.

Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of C\u00e1diz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex's prestige rivalled Elizabeth's own.<ref>David Starkey, ''Elizabeth'' (Channel 4, 1999), Episode 4, 'Gloriana'.</ref>\n\nThe Crown instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, competed with them for private profit, a race it failed to win, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable.<ref name=\"Andrews30\">Andrews p 30</ref> The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex known as the [[Islands Voyage]].

Mendoza then attempted to take [[Bommelerwaard]] island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him [[siege of Zaltbommel|at Zaltbommel]]. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish army - mutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by [[Johan van Oldenbarneveldt]] saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used [[Ostend]] (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of [[Dunkirk]]. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and in a pitched battle the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat on the [[Tercio]] led Spanish army at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]] in which the English played a major part.<ref name=\"Borman224\">Borman pp 224\u201325</ref> Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority.

Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had [[Siege of Paris (1590)|unsuccessfully besieged in 1590]]. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] as a launching point for an invasion of England by [[Siege of Fort Crozon|capturing Fort Crozon]].\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion|French civil war]] turned increasingly against the hardliners of the [[French Catholic League]]. With the signing of the [[Triple Alliance (1596)|Triple Alliance in 1596]] between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|Spanish took Calais]]. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|retook Amiens]], just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition, Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support, the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the [[Peace of Vervins]] ending the last of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious civil wars]] and the Spanish intervention with it.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=William Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry the Great, and of the Court of France During His Reign: Vol 2|year=1824|publisher=Harding, Triphook & Lepard|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEYOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=}}</ref>\n\n===Ireland===\nIn 1594, the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] in Ireland had begun, when [[Ulster]] lords [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] and [[Red Hugh O'Donnell]] rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the [[2nd Spanish Armada|first was shattered in a storm]] off northern Spain, and the second [[3rd Spanish Armada|was frustrated by adverse weather]] as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] continued the war but was less determined.\n\nAt the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the [[Battle of Kinsale]]. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.\n\nThe new king of England, [[James I of England|James I]], was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.<ref>W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998).</ref> Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with [[Philip III of Spain]].\n\n===End of the war===\nWith the end of the war in France, the new King of Spain [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] sought peace with England. By 1598 the war had become long and costly for Spain. England and Dutch republic too were war-weary and both sides felt the need for peace.<ref name=\" MacCaffrey\">MacCaffrey pp. 226-30</ref> At the peace of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in 1600 however Spanish demands were adamantly rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes were open between the [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] and his wife  [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Infanta Isabella]] (Philip's sister) who differed in their policies to Philip's. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.<ref name=\"McCoog\">McCoog pp. 222-23</ref>\n\nSoon after victory in Ireland the following year the English navy under [[Richard Leveson]] conducted a blockade of Spain; the first of its kind. Off Portugal, they sailed into [[Sesimbra]] bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under [[Federico Spinola]] (brother of Ambrogio) and [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 2nd Marquis of Santa Cruz|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n]] were present.<ref name=\"Duerloo\">Duerloo pp. 137-38</ref> Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England. In June 1602 Leveson [[Battle of Sesimbra Bay|defeated]] the Spanish which resulted in two galleys sunk and the capture of a rich Portuguese carrack. Months later in the English channel Spinola's galley fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but [[Battle of the Narrow Seas|was defeated again]] by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits. The result of this action forced the Spanish to cease further naval operations against England for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Wernham\">Wernham pg&nbsp; 400-01</ref>\n\n== Treaty and aftermath ==\n{{further|Treaty of London (1604)}}\n[[File:The Somerset House Conference, 1604 from NPG.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Somerset House Conference]] between diplomats of England (right) and Spain (left) ([[Somerset House Conference (painting)|painting]])]]\nThe treaty restored the [[status quo ante bellum]], and the terms of the treaty were favourable both to Spain and England.<ref name=\"Morgan\"/><ref name=\"Allen142\">Allen pp. 142-43</ref> For Spain the treaty secured her position as a leading power in the world.<ref>''The Pirates' Pact: The Secret Alliances Between History's Most Notorious Buccaneers and Colonial America.''

between the kingdoms of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] that was never formally declared.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Expansion of Elizabethan England|last=Rowse|first=A. L|publisher=palgrave macmillan|year=1955|isbn=978-1403908131|page=241}}</ref> The war was punctuated by widely separated battles, and began with England's military expedition in 1585 to what was then the [[Spanish Netherlands]] under the command of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] in support of the resistance of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] to [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] rule.\n\nThe English enjoyed some victories at [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard|C\u00e1diz]] in 1587, and saw the [[Spanish Armada]] retreat in 1588, but then suffered severe defeats of the [[English Armada]] in 1589 and the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Drake\u2013Hawkins]] and [[Islands Voyage|Essex\u2013Raleigh]] expeditions in 1595 and 1597 respectively. Two further Spanish armadas were sent in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]] but were frustrated in their objectives mainly because of adverse weather and poor planning.\n\nThe war became deadlocked around the turn of the 17th century during campaigns in the [[Eighty Years' War (1566\u20131609)|Netherlands]], [[French Wars of Religion|France]] and [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Ireland]]. It was brought to an end with the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], negotiated in 1604 between representatives of the new King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], and the new King of England, [[James I of England|James I]]. England and Spain agreed to cease their military interventions in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas [[privateering]].\n\n== Causes ==\nIn the 1560s, [[Philip II of Spain]] was faced with increasing religious disturbances as [[Protestantism]] gained adherents in his domains in the [[Low Countries]]. As a defender of the [[Catholic Church]], he sought to suppress the rising Protestant movement in his territories, which eventually exploded into [[Dutch Revolt|open rebellion]] in 1566.  Meanwhile, relations with the regime of [[Elizabeth I of England]] continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the [[Church of England]] through the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and rescinded by her sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Philip's wife. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority.  Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in [[France]], which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Opposing Monarchs\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Philipp II Spanien MATEO.jpg|<center><br />[[Philip II of Spain]]</center>\nFile:Elisabeth I England MATEO.jpg|<center><br />[[Elizabeth I of England]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nComplicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins's trade with their colonies in the [[West Indies]] constituted [[smuggling]]. In September 1568, a slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir [[Francis Drake]] was surprised by the Spanish, and several ships were captured or sunk at the [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa]] near [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in [[New Spain]]. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their [[privateering]] as a way to break the Spanish [[monopoly]] on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage where he eventually [[Francis Drake#Circumnavigation of the earth (1577\u20131580)|circumnavigated the globe]] between 1577 and 1580. Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured including the treasure galleon ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n]]''. When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth's relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.\n\nSoon after the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]], English support was provided to [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Prior of Crato]] who then fought [[War of the Portuguese Succession|in his struggle]] with Philip II for the [[Portugal|Portuguese throne]]. Philip in return began to support the [[Second Desmond Rebellion|Catholic rebellion in Ireland]] against Elizabeth's religious reforms. Both Philip's and Elizabeth's attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.\n\nIn 1584, Philip signed the [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]] to stop the rise of [[French Wars of Religion|Protestantism there]]. In the [[Spanish Netherlands]], England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], who were [[Eighty Years War|fighting for independence]] from Spain. In 1584, the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the [[Fall of Antwerp|capture of Antwerp]] by Spanish forces led by [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma]]. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England.<ref>Tracey pp.157-58</ref> The [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] was signed as a result \u2013 Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies but she declined overall sovereignty. In return, the Dutch handed over four [[Cautionary Towns]] which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.\n\n== War ==\nThe Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of [[Spanish Company|English merchant ships]] in Spanish harbors. In response the English [[Privy Council of England|privy council]] immediately authorised [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|a campaign]] against the Spanish fishing industry in [[Newfoundland]] and off the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].<ref name=\"Bicheno\">Bicheno p 180</ref> The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England's first sustained activity in the Americas.<ref>[[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIp7_e8KMJ0C&pg=PA31&#v=onepage&q&f=false The Jamestown Project]</ref> In August, England joined the [[Eighty Years' War#Secession and reconquest (1579\u20131588)|Eighty Years' War]] on the side of the Dutch Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], which had declared their independence from Spain.\n\nThe Queen through [[Francis Walsingham]] ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] in a kind of [[preemptive strike]]. Drake sailed in October to the [[West Indies]], and in January 1586 [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|captured and sacked Santo Domingo]]. The following month they did the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|same at Cartagena de Indias]] and in May sailed North [[Raid on St. Augustine|to raid St. Augustine]] in [[Florida]]. When Drake arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain however, the news was a disaster and this now further buoyed a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip.<ref name=\"Konstam\">Konstam p.76-77</ref>\n\n=== Dutch Revolt (1585\u20131587) ===\n[[File:Siege of Grave - Beleg van Grave door de Prins van Parma (1586).jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Grave (1586)|Siege of Grave]] in 1586]]\n[[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester]] was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offer of Governor of the United Provinces. This, however, was met with fury from Elizabeth who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir [[John Norreys]]. They combined forces but were undermanned and under financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma]].<ref>Hammer 2003 pp. 125\u2013127</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Grave (1586)|siege of Grave]] the following year Dudley attempted its relief but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave's sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 282\u2013284</ref> The English force then had some successes - [[Capture of Axel|taking Axel]] in July and [[Doesburg]] the following month. Dudley's poor diplomacy with the Dutch however made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation.<ref name=\"t' Hart\">t' Hart p.21-22</ref> Outside [[Zutphen]] an English force [[Battle of Zutphen|was defeated]] in which notable poet [[Philip Sidney]] was mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and [[Deventer]] were betrayed by catholic [[turncoat]]s [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] and [[Rowland York]] which further damaged Leicester's reputation. Finally [[Sluis]] with a largely English garrison [[Siege of Sluis (1587)|was besieged and taken]] by the Duke of Parma in June 1587 after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 291\u2013294</ref>\n\nLeicester soon realised how dire his situation was and then asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as Governor - his tenure was a military and political failure, and as a result, he was financially ruined.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 294\u2013295</ref> After Leicester's departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange's son Count [[Maurice of Nassau]] as the [[Stadtholder]] and Governor. At the same time [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Peregrine Bertie]] took over English forces in the Netherlands.\n\n=== Spanish Armada ===\n{{main|Spanish Armada|Spanish Armada in Ireland}}\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Invincible Armada'', National Maritime Museum, London]]\n\nOn 8 February 1587, the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] outraged Catholics in Europe, and her claim on the English throne passed (by her own deed of will) to Philip. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip's preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard|burned 37 Spanish ships]] in the harbour of [[C\u00e1diz]], and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.\n\nOn 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by [[Pope Pius V]], and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors. To finance this endeavour, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.<ref>{{Cite CE1913 |wstitle=Spanish Armada |first=John Hungerford |last=Pollen |volume=1}}\"Pope Sixtus V agreed to renew the excommunication of the Queen, and to grant a large subsidy to the Armada, but, knowing the slowness of Spain, would give nothing till the expedition should actually land in England. In this way, he was saved his million crowns, and spared the reproach of having taken futile proceedings against the heretic queen.\"</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 1588, the Armada under the command of [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English channel, the English navy led by [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] and Francis Drake fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from [[Plymouth]] to [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] and then to the [[Solent]], preventing them from securing any English harbours.<ref name=\"Hanson\">Hanson p. 379</ref> The Spanish were forced to withdraw to [[Calais]]. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent [[Spanish Armada#Battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]] the English navy inflicted a defeat on the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around [[Scotland]], the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.<ref name=\"ParkerMartin\">Parker & Martin p. 215</ref>\n\nPhilip's invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The defeat of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II's enemies in the Netherlands and [[France]], these efforts brought few tangible rewards.<ref name=\"Holmes 2001, p. 858.\">Richard Holmes 2001, p. 858: \"The 1588 campaign was a major English propaganda victory, but in strategic terms, it was essentially indecisive.\"</ref> One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada's failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the [[Latin]]/[[Hebrew]] inscription ''Flavit \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 et Dissipati Sunt'' (literally: \"[[Yahweh]] blew and they were scattered\"; traditionally translated more freely as: \"[[He blew with His winds, and they were scattered]]\".)\n\n=== English Armada ===\n{{main|English Armada}}\n[[File:Maria Pita, A Coru\u00f1a 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Statue of [[Maria Pita]] at Coruna]]\n\nAn English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir [[John Norreys]] was prepared in 1589 to torch the Spanish Atlantic navy, which was refitting in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in northern Spain. It was also intended to capture the incoming [[Spanish treasure fleet]] and expel the Spanish from Portugal (ruled by Philip since 1580) in favour of the Prior of Crato. The English fleet departed from&nbsp;Plymouth&nbsp;on&nbsp;April 13 but was then delayed for nearly two weeks by bad weather. Drake, as a result, had to bypass Santander where the majority of the Spanish fleet were being refitted.\n\nOn May 4, the English force eventually arrived at Corunna where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norreys then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed. In addition, a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces. With the failure to capture Corunna the English departed and headed towards [[Lisbon]], but owing to poor organisation and lack of co-ordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving the English retreated and headed North where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Sickness then struck the expedition, and finally, a portion of the fleet led by Drake headed towards the [[Azores]], which was then scattered in a storm. Drake then took the best part of the fleet and plundered [[Porto Santo]] in [[Madeira]] before they limped back to Plymouth.<ref>R. B. Wernham, 'Queen Elizabeth and the Portugal Expedition of 1589: Part II', ''English Historical Review'', 66/259 (April 1951), pp. 204 - 14</ref>\n\nThe English Armada was arguably misconceived and ended in failure overall. In the end, Elizabeth sustained a severe loss to her treasury.\n\n=== Dutch Revolt (1588\u20131595) ===\nSoon after the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]], the Duke of Parma's force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards [[Bergen op Zoom]] and then attempted to [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1588)|besiege the English-held town]] with a substantial force. The English in a [[Ruse de guerre|ruse]] however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma's retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book|last1=[[Charles Maurice Davies]]|title=The History of Holland and the Dutch nation: from the beginning of the tenth century to the end of the eighteenth|date=1851|publisher=G.

In a remarkable feat, a small assault force hid in a peat [[barge]] before a [[Capture of Breda (1590)|successful surprise assault]] that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started the gradual recapture of the Netherlands. This was known by the Dutch as the 'Ten glory years'. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch  [[Siege of Zutphen (1591)|retook Zutphen]] and [[Siege of Deventer (1591)|Deventer]] which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma [[Siege of Knodsenburg|at Knodsenberg]] in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with [[Siege of Hulst (1591)|Hulst]], [[Siege of Nijmegen (1591)|Nijmegen]], [[Siege of Geertruidenberg (1593)|Geertruidenberg]], [[Siege of Steenwijk (1592)|Steenwijk]] and [[Siege of Coevorden (1592)|Coevorden]] all being taken within the next two years.<ref name=\"Knight\"/> In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by [[Francisco Verdugo]] to recapture Coevorden [[Siege of Coevorden (1593)|ended in failure]] when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the Spring of 1594. Finally, the [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|capture of Groningen]] in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the Northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.<ref name=\"HadHam\">Hadfield & Hammond p.49</ref>\n\nAfter these successes, Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crowns expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.\n\nIn 1595, Maurice's campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the [[Twente]] region from the Spanish. This was delayed after [[Huy]] was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent [[Siege of Huy (1595)|its fall]]. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to [[Siege of Groenlo (1595)|take Grol]] in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under a 90-year-old veteran [[Crist\u00f3bal de Mondrag\u00f3n]] relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of [[Rheinberg]] in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the [[Battle of the Lippe]]. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. The Spanish under the new commander [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] took advantage of this lull and [[Siege of Hulst (1596)|recaptured Hulst]] the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===Naval War and Privateering===\n[[File:The Last fight of the Revenge off Flores in the Azores 1591 by Charles Dixon.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Last fight of the Revenge'' off Flores in the Azores 1591]]\nIn this period of respite, the Spanish were able to refit and retool their navy, partly along English lines. The pride of the fleet were named ''The Twelve Apostles'' \u2013 twelve massive new [[galleon]]s \u2013 and the navy proved itself to be far more effective than it had been before 1588. A sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence networks frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the [[Azores]], who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish [[Battle of Flores (1591)|captured]] the English flagship, the ''[[HMS Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'', after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir [[Richard Grenville]]. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.\n\nEnglish merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth's [[Sea Dogs|''Sea dogs'']] however enjoyed more qualified success.<ref name=\"Andrews124\">Andrews p. 124-25</ref> In the three years after the Spanish armada more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over \u00a3400,000.<ref name=\"Bicheno320\">Bicheno p. 320</ref> English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profit - his first being the [[Azores Voyage of 1589|Azores Voyage in 1589]]. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with [[Battle of Berlengas Islands|Spanish galleys off Berlengas]]. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and [[Martin Frobisher]] combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] island in 1592 in [[Battle of Flores (1592)|a naval battle]] the English fleet captured a large rich Portuguese carrack, the [[Madre de Deus]] as well as having outwitted a Spanish fleet led by [[Alonso de Baz\u00e1n]]. The expedition's reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England's royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment.<ref name=\"Andrews73\">Andrews p 73</ref> These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[John Ramsay McCulloch|McCulloch, John Ramsay]] |title=A Treatise on the Principles, Practice, & History of Commerce|date=1833|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|page=[https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonprin00goog/page/n138 120]|url=https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonprin00goog}}</ref> Raleigh himself in 1595 went on [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|an expedition to explore]] the [[Orinoco river]] in an attempt to find the mythical city of [[El Dorado]] in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad. Raleigh however exaggerated the wealth there on his return to England. Supporting Raleigh with his expedition was another led by Amyas Preston and [[George Somers]] known as the [[Preston Somers Expedition|Preston Somers expedition]] to South America notable for a daring overland assault that saw the capture of [[Caracas]].\n\nMany of the expeditions were financed by famed London merchants, the most notable of these being [[John Watts (merchant)|John Watts]].

The allies were unable to capture the treasure, as the Spanish commander had time to torch the treasure ships in port, sending the treasure to the bottom of the harbour, from where it was later recovered. Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of C\u00e1diz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex's prestige rivalled Elizabeth's own.<ref>David Starkey, ''Elizabeth'' (Channel 4, 1999), Episode 4, 'Gloriana'.</ref>\n\nThe Crown instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, competed with them for private profit, a race it failed to win, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable.<ref name=\"Andrews30\">Andrews p 30</ref> The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex known as the [[Islands Voyage]]. The objective was to destroy the Spanish fleet and intercept a treasure fleet in the Azores.

At the [[Battle of Turnhout (1597)|Battle of Turnout]] a Spanish force was surprised and routed - Vere and Sir [[Robert Sydney]] distinguished themselves particularly. With the Spanish distracted by the siege of Amiens in France Maurice launched an offensive in the summer. This time both [[Siege of Rheinberg (1597)|Rhienberg]] and [[Siege of Groenlo (1597)|Greonlo]] were finally taken. This was followed by the capture of [[Siege of Bredevoort (1597)|Bredevoort]], [[Capture of Enschede (1597)|Enschede]], [[Capture of Ootmarsum|Ootsmarsum]], [[Siege of Oldenzaal (1597)|Oldenzaal]] and finally [[Siege of Lingen (1597)|Lingen]] by the end of the year. The offensive success meant that most of the Republic had been recaptured and a significant barrier had been created along the Rhine river.<ref>{{cite book |last= Motley|first= John Lothrop|title=History of the United Netherlands: from the Death of William the Silent to the Twelve Years' Truce--1609|volume=3|page=422|url=https://archive.org/details/jm23v}}</ref>\n[[File:Sebastiaen Vrancx (1573-1647) - Veldslag (1640) - Sevilla Bellas Artes 22-03-2011 12-07-38.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Nieuwpoort]] in 1600 by [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]]]]\n\nIn 1598, the Spanish under [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de Mendoza y Mendoza|Francisco Mendoza]] retook [[Siege of Rheinberg (1598)|Rheinberg and Meurs]] in a campaign known as the ''Spanish winter of 1598-99''. Mendoza then attempted to take [[Bommelerwaard]] island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him [[siege of Zaltbommel|at Zaltbommel]]. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish army - mutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by [[Johan van Oldenbarneveldt]] saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used [[Ostend]] (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of [[Dunkirk]]. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and in a pitched battle the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat on the [[Tercio]] led Spanish army at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]] in which the English played a major part.<ref name=\"Borman224\">Borman pp 224\u201325</ref> Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority.

[[Siege of Rheinberg (1601)|Rheinberg and Meurs]] were thus retaken from the Spanish yet again, although an attempt on [[Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch (1601)|s'Hertogenbosch failed]] during the winter months. At Ostend in January 1602 after being reinforced, Vere faced a huge Spanish assault organised by the Archduke and in bitter fighting this was repelled with heavy losses. Vere left the city soon after and joined Maurice in the field, while Albert was replaced [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]]. The siege there dragged on for another two years as the Spanish attempted to take Ostend's strongpoints in a costly [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. Around the same time Maurice continued \u2013 his campaign [[Siege of Grave (1602)|Grave was retaken]] but Vere was severely wounded during the siege. An attempt by the Dutch and English to relieve Ostend took place in mid-1604 but the inland of port of [[Siege of Sluis (1604)|Sluis was besieged and captured]] instead. Soon after the Ostend garrison finally surrendered, after  a siege of nearly four years and costing thousands of lives \u2013 for the Spanish, it was a [[pyrrhic victory]].<ref>Edmundson p 102-03</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Watson & Thomson|first1=Robert & William|title=The History of the Reign of Philip III.

In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in [[Brittany]] to assist the French [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], expelling the English and [[Huguenot]] forces from much of the area. Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had [[Siege of Paris (1590)|unsuccessfully besieged in 1590]]. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] as a launching point for an invasion of England by [[Siege of Fort Crozon|capturing Fort Crozon]].\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion|French civil war]] turned increasingly against the hardliners of the [[French Catholic League]]. With the signing of the [[Triple Alliance (1596)|Triple Alliance in 1596]] between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|Spanish took Calais]]. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|retook Amiens]], just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition, Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support, the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the [[Peace of Vervins]] ending the last of the [[French Wars of Religion|religious civil wars]] and the Spanish intervention with it.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=William Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry the Great, and of the Court of France During His Reign: Vol 2|year=1824|publisher=Harding, Triphook & Lepard|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEYOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=}}</ref>\n\n===Ireland===\nIn 1594, the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] in Ireland had begun, when [[Ulster]] lords [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] and [[Red Hugh O'Donnell]] rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the [[2nd Spanish Armada|first was shattered in a storm]] off northern Spain, and the second [[3rd Spanish Armada|was frustrated by adverse weather]] as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] continued the war but was less determined.\n\nAt the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the [[Battle of Kinsale]]. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.\n\nThe new king of England, [[James I of England|James I]], was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.<ref>W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998).</ref> Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with [[Philip III of Spain]].\n\n===End of the war===\nWith the end of the war in France, the new King of Spain [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] sought peace with England. By 1598 the war had become long and costly for Spain. England and Dutch republic too were war-weary and both sides felt the need for peace.<ref name=\" MacCaffrey\">MacCaffrey pp. 226-30</ref> At the peace of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in 1600 however Spanish demands were adamantly rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes were open between the [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] and his wife  [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Infanta Isabella]] (Philip's sister) who differed in their policies to Philip's. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.<ref name=\"McCoog\">McCoog pp. 222-23</ref>\n\nSoon after victory in Ireland the following year the English navy under [[Richard Leveson]] conducted a blockade of Spain; the first of its kind. Off Portugal, they sailed into [[Sesimbra]] bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under [[Federico Spinola]] (brother of Ambrogio) and [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 2nd Marquis of Santa Cruz|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n]] were present.<ref name=\"Duerloo\">Duerloo pp. 137-38</ref> Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England.

Months later in the English channel Spinola's galley fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but [[Battle of the Narrow Seas|was defeated again]] by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits.
