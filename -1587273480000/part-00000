It was released on 29 April 1985 by [[RCA Records]].\n\n==Background==\nLargely recorded in Paris, with additional recording in [[Detroit]] and [[Los Angeles]], this album saw Eurythmics move away from their previous more experimental, synthesizer-based songs, to a more commercial pop/rock sound. Combining elements of [[Motown]] and rock music, the album incorporates a more traditional band line-up/instrumentation. Nonetheless, the recordings still possessed an atmospheric and cutting edge sound, winning [[David A. Stewart]] awards for his production work on the album. The release of the album also coincided with a new look for singer [[Annie Lennox]], who ditched the androgynous look of the previous albums and became, in biographer Lucy O'Brien's words, \"a bleach-blonde rock 'n' roller\". ''Be Yourself Tonight'' includes guest appearances by notable artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Elvis Costello]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n''Be Yourself Tonight'' is Eurythmics' best-selling studio album.{{cn|date=August 2018}} It reached the top 3 in the UK and top 10 in the US, as well as spawning several hit singles. The album includes the duo's first (and only) UK number-one \"[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]\" and the American Top 5 and Australian number-one hit \"[[Would I Lie to You? (Eurythmics song)|Would I Lie to You?]]\".\n\nNo tour followed the album's release, due to Lennox's recuperation from [[vocal fold nodules]] (which also caused her to miss 1985's [[Live Aid]] concert).\n\nOn 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics' back catalogue as \"2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues\". Each of their eight studio albums' original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A.

It was released on 29 April 1985 by [[RCA Records]].\n\n==Background==\nLargely recorded in Paris, with additional recording in [[Detroit]] and [[Los Angeles]], this album saw Eurythmics move away from their previous more experimental, synthesizer-based songs, to a more commercial pop/rock sound. Combining elements of [[Motown]] and rock music, the album incorporates a more traditional band line-up/instrumentation. Nonetheless, the recordings still possessed an atmospheric and cutting edge sound, winning [[David A. Stewart]] awards for his production work on the album. The release of the album also coincided with a new look for singer [[Annie Lennox]], who ditched the androgynous look of the previous albums and became, in biographer Lucy O'Brien's words, \"a bleach-blonde rock 'n' roller\". ''Be Yourself Tonight'' includes guest appearances by notable artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Elvis Costello]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n''Be Yourself Tonight'' is Eurythmics' best-selling studio album.{{cn|date=August 2018}} It reached the top 3 in the UK and top 10 in the US, as well as spawning several hit singles. The album includes the duo's first (and only) UK number-one \"[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]\" and the American Top 5 and Australian number-one hit \"[[Would I Lie to You? (Eurythmics song)|Would I Lie to You?]]\".\n\nNo tour followed the album's release, due to Lennox's recuperation from [[vocal fold nodules]] (which also caused her to miss 1985's [[Live Aid]] concert).\n\nOn 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics' back catalogue as \"2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues\". Each of their eight studio albums' original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A.
