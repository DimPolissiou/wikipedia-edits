The [[Logical equivalence|equivalence rules]] of relational algebra are exploited, in other words, different query structures and orderings can be mathematically proven to yield the same result. For example, filtering on fields A and B, or cross joining R and S can be done in any order, but there can be a performance difference. Multiple operations may be combined, and operation orders may be altered.\n\nThe result of query rewriting may not be at the same abstraction level or [[application programming interface]] (API) as the original set of queries (though often is). For example, the input queries may be in relational algebra or SQL, and the rewritten queries may be closer to the physical representation of the data, e.g. array operations.

The [[Logical equivalence|equivalence rules]] of relational algebra are exploited, in other words, different query structures and orderings can be mathematically proven to yield the same result. For example, filtering on fields A and B, or cross joining R and S can be done in any order, but there can be a performance difference. Multiple operations may be combined, and operation orders may be altered.\n\nThe result of query rewriting may not be at the same abstraction level or API as the original set of queries (though often is).

It also supports [[animation]]s and allows a separate [[palette (computing)|palette]] of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color. Unlike video, the GIF file format does not support audio.\n\nGIF images are compressed using the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) [[lossless data compression]] technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the [[software patent]] holder, [[Unisys]], and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.\n\n==History==\n{{See|#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|l1=Unisys and LZW patent enforcement}}\n\n[[CompuServe]] introduced GIF on June 15, 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier [[run-length encoding]] (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW data compression]], which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as those used by [[PCX]] and [[MacPaint]], and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow [[modem]]s.\n\nThe original version of GIF was called '''87a'''.<ref name=\"87aSpec\" /> In 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called '''89a''',<ref name=\"89aSpec\" /> which added support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six [[byte]]s of the file (the \"[[magic number (programming)|magic number]]\" or signature), which, when interpreted as [[ASCII]], read \"GIF87a\" and \"GIF89a\", respectively.\n\nCompuServe encouraged the adoption of GIF by providing downloadable conversion utilities for many computers. By December 1987, for example, an [[Apple IIGS]] user could view pictures created on an [[Atari ST]] or [[Commodore 64]].<ref name=\"caa198712\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Online Art | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | pages=10}}</ref> GIF was one of the first two image formats commonly used on Web sites, the other being the black-and-white [[XBM]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ajax: The Definitive Guide: Interactive Applications for the Web|last=Holdener III|first=Anthony|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2008|isbn=978-0596528386|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1995 [[Netscape (web browser)#Release history|Netscape Navigator]] 2.0 added [[#Animated GIF|the ability for animated GIFs to loop]].\n\nThe feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by control data, is used extensively on the Web to produce simple [[computer animation|animations]].

Many GIF files have a single image that fills the entire logical screen. Others divide the logical screen into separate sub-images. The images may also function as animation frames in an animated GIF file, but again these need not fill the entire logical screen.\n\nGIF files start with a fixed-length header (\"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\") giving the version, followed by a fixed-length Logical Screen Descriptor giving the pixel dimensions and other characteristics of the logical screen. The screen descriptor may also specify the presence and size of a Global Color Table, which follows next if present.\n<source lang=\"hexdump\" class=\"floatright\">\n00000000  47 49 46 38 39 61 01 00  01 00 80 00 00 00 00 00  |GIF89a..........|\n00000010  ff ff ff 21 f9 04 01 00  00 00 00 2c 00 00 00 00  |...!.......,....|\n00000020  01 00 01 00 00 02 01 44  00 3b                    |.......D.;|\n0000002a\n</source>\nThereafter, the file is divided into segments, each introduced by a 1-byte sentinel:\n* An image (introduced by 0x2C, an ASCII comma {{code|','}})\n* An extension block (introduced by 0x21, an ASCII exclamation point {{code|'!'}})\n* The trailer (a single byte of value 0x3B, an ASCII semicolon {{code|';'}}), which should be the last byte of the file.\n\nAn image starts with a fixed-length Image Descriptor, which may specify the presence and size of a Local Color Table (which follows next if present). The image data follows: one byte giving the bit width of the unencoded symbols (which must be at least 2 bits wide, even for bi-color images), followed by a linked list of sub-blocks containing the LZW-encoded data.\n\nExtension blocks (blocks that \"extend\" the 87a definition via a mechanism already defined in the 87a spec) consist of the sentinel, an additional byte specifying the type of extension, and a linked list of sub-blocks with the extension data. Extension blocks that modify an image (like the Graphic Control Extension that specifies the optional animation delay time and optional transparent background color) must immediately precede the segment with the image they refer to.\n\nThe linked lists used by the image data and the extension blocks consist of series of sub-blocks, each sub-block beginning with a byte giving the number of subsequent data bytes in the sub-block (1 to 255). The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a 0 byte).\n\nThis structure allows the file to be parsed even if not all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.\n\nThe full detail of the file format is covered in the GIF specification.<ref name=\"89aSpec\"/>\n\n==Palettes==\n[[File:Sunflower as gif websafe.gif|thumb|right|An example of a GIF image saved with a [[web-safe]] palette and dithered using the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg]] method. Due to the reduced number of colors in the image, there are display issues.]]\nGIF is palette-based: the colors used in an image (a frame) in the file have their [[RGB]] values defined in a [[Palette (computing)|palette table]] that can hold up to 256 entries, and the data for the image refer to the colors by their indices (0\u2013255) in the palette table. The color definitions in the palette can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (2<sup>24</sup> shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.\n\nEach frame can designate one index as a \"transparent background color\": any pixel assigned this index takes on the color of the pixel in the same position from the background, which may have been determined by a previous frame of animation.\n\nMany techniques, collectively called [[dithering]], have been developed to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of the GIF specification, dithering can be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy on the screen, and because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.\n\nIn the early days of graphical web browsers{{when|date=March 2015}}, graphics cards with 8-bit buffers (allowing only 256 colors) were common and it was fairly common to make GIF images using the [[Web-safe colors|websafe palette]].{{according_to_whom|date=March 2015}} This ensured predictable display, but severely limited the choice of colors. When 24-bit color became the norm palettes could instead be populated with the optimum colors for individual images.\n\nA small color table may suffice for small images, and keeping the color table small allows the file to be downloaded faster. Both the 87a and 89a specifications allow color tables of 2<sup>''n''</sup> colors for any ''n'' from 1 through 8. Most graphics applications will read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes; but some do not support all sizes when ''creating'' images. Tables of 2, 16, and 256 colors are widely supported.\n\n===True color===\n[[File:SmallFullColourGIF.gif|thumb|right|210px|An animated GIF illustrating a technique for displaying more than the typical limit of 256 colors]]\nAlthough GIF is almost never used for [[color depth#True color (24-bit)|true color]] images, it is possible to do so.<ref name=aminet>{{cite web |url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web |url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> A GIF image can include multiple image blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a \"transparent\" color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.\n\nTo render a full-color image as a GIF, the original image must be broken down into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks) the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.<ref name=aminet />\n\nSince each image block requires its own local color table, a GIF file having lots of image blocks can be very large, limiting the usefulness of full-color GIFs.<ref name=philhoward /> Additionally, not all GIF rendering programs handle tiled or layered images correctly. Many rendering programs interpret tiles or layers as animation frames and display them in sequence as an endless animation<ref name=aminet /> with most web browsers automatically displaying the frames with a delay time of 0.1 seconds or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser-compatibility|title=Nullsleep - Jeremiah Johnson - Animated GIF Minimum Frame Delay Browser Compatibility Study|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201034945/http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2017|title=They're different!

The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit size of the bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a \"little-Endian\" scheme: the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary. Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.\n\nThis byte stream is stored in the file as a series of \"sub-blocks\". Each sub-block has a maximum length 255 bytes and is prefixed with a byte indicating the number of data bytes in the sub-block. The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a single 0 byte, indicating a sub-block with 0 data bytes).\n\nFor the sample image above the reversible mapping between 9-bit codes and bytes is shown below.\n\n{| style=\"font-family:monospace; margin-left:2em\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! 9-bit code<br />(hex)\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"| Binary\n!

A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from the palette, with no output action as long as the local string can be found in a code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).\n\n                           '''Table           9-bit'''\n                      <u>'''string --> code      code    Action'''</u>\n                           #0 | 000h               Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                     palette  |  :\n                      colors  |  :\n                         #255 | 0FFh\n                          clr | 100h\n                          end | 101h\n                              |            100h     Clear\n Pixel          Local         |\n color Palette  string        |\n BLACK  #40     28            |            028h     1st pixel always to output\n WHITE  #255    FF            |                     String found in table\n                   28 FF      | 102h                Always add 1st string to table\n                FF            |                     Initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String not found in table\n                              |            0FFh     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF      | 103h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n BLACK  #40     FF FF 28      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF 28   | 104h                - add latest string to table\n                28            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    28 FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    28 FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            102h     - output code for previous string\n                   28 FF FF   | 105h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF FF   | 106h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String not found in table\n                              |            106h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF FF FF| 107h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String found in table\n                                                    No more pixels\n                                           107h     - output code for last string\n                                           101h     End\n\nFor clarity the table is shown above as being built of strings of increasing length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new string to be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.\n\nThe LZW algorithm requires a search of the table for each pixel. A linear search through up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some [[Successive approximation ADC|ADCs]]), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.\n\n===Image decoding===\nDecoding begins by mapping the stored bytes back to 9-bit codes. These are decoded to recover the pixel colors as shown below. A table identical to the one used in the encoder is built by adding strings by this rule:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Is incoming code found in table?\n|  {{Yes}} || add string for local code followed by first byte of string for incoming code\n|-\n|  {{No}}  || add string for local code followed by copy of its own first byte\n|}\n\n       '''shift'''\n '''9-bit ----> Local      Table                 Pixel'''\n <u>'''code        code   code --> string   Palette color  Action'''</u>\n 100h               000h  | #0                       Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                     :    | palette\n                     :    | colors\n                    0FFh  | #255\n                    100h  | clr\n                    101h  | end\n 028h                     |             #40   {{font color|WHITE|BLACK|BLACK}}  Decode 1st pixel\n 0FFh        028h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}   - output string from table\n                    102h  | 28 FF                     - add to table\n 103h        0FFh         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    103h  | FF FF                     - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 102h        103h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #40   {{font color|WHITE|BLACK|BLACK}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                    104h  | FF FF 28                  - add to table\n 103h        102h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                    105h  | 28 FF FF                  - add to table\n 106h        103h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    106h  | FF FF FF                  - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 107h        106h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    107h  | FF FF FF FF               - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 101h                     |                           End\n\n===LZW code lengths===\nShorter code lengths can be used for palettes smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.\n\nConversely, the symbol width could be set at 8, even if only values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a 2-color table. Although there would be no point in encoding the file that way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.\n\nThe code table initially contains codes that are one bit longer than the symbol size in order to accommodate the two special codes ''clr'' and ''end'' and codes for strings that are added during the process. When the table is full the code length increases to give space for more strings, up to a maximum code 4095 = FFF(hex). As the decoder builds its table it tracks these increases in code length and it is able to unpack incoming bytes accordingly.\n\n===Uncompressed GIF===\n[[File:Quilt design as 46x46 uncompressed GIF.gif|thumb|\nA 46 x 46 uncompressed GIF with 7-bit symbols (128 colors, 8-bit codes). Click on the image for an explanation of the code.]]\nThe GIF encoding process can be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally as a way to avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.\n\nThe modified encoding method ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices all of the compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.\n\nIf the symbol width is {{mvar|n}}, the codes of width {{math|''n''+1}} fall naturally into two blocks: the lower block of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} codes for coding single symbols, and the upper block of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} codes that will be used by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} for CLEAR and {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} + 1}} for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, {{math|2<sup>''n''+1</sup> \u2212 1}}, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 3}} codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 2}} codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 2}} codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.\n\nFor the sample 3x5 image above, the following 9-bit codes represent \"clear\" (100) followed by image pixels in scan order and \"stop\" (101).\n\n 9-bit codes: 100 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 101\n\nAfter the above codes are mapped to bytes, the uncompressed file differs from the compressed file thus:\n<pre>\n :\n320: 14            20            20 bytes uncompressed image data follow\n321: 00 51 FC FB F7 0F C5 BF 7F FF FE FD FB F7 EF DF BF 7F 01 01\n335: 00                          - end\n :\n</pre>\n\n==Compression example==\nThe trivial example of a large image of solid color demonstrates the variable-length LZW compression used in GIF files.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Code\n! colspan=2 | Pixels\n!

A block of image data begins with a byte that declares the number of bytes to follow. The last block of data for an image is marked by a zero block-length byte.\n\n== Interlacing ==\nThe GIF Specification allows each image within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify that it is interlaced; i.e., that the order of the raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be recognized before the full image is painted.\n\nAn interlaced image is divided from top to bottom into strips 8 pixels high, and the rows of the image are presented in the following order:\n* Pass 1: Line 0 (the top-most line) from each strip.\n* Pass 2: Line 4 from each strip.\n* Pass 3: Lines 2 and 6 from each strip.\n* Pass 4: Lines 1, 3, 5, and 7 from each strip.\n\nThe pixels within each line are not interlaced, but presented consecutively from left to right. As with non-interlaced images, there is no break between the data for one line and the data for the next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the image's header block.\n\n==Animated GIF==\n<!--OTRS [[Ticket:2014021510009504]] gives permission for references to some GIFs, and code here.

To facilitate ''displaying'' animations, the GIF89a spec added the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows the images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays, forming a [[video clip]]. Each frame in an animation GIF is introduced by its own GCE specifying the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information at the start of the file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.\n\nBy default, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. To enable an animation to loop, [[Netscape]] in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |title=All About GIF89a\n |author=Royal Frazier\n |accessdate=7 January 2013\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990418091037/http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |archive-date=18 April 1999\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref> This block, placed immediately before the sequence of animation frames, specifies the number of times the sequence of frames should be played or that it should repeat continuously.

Some economy of data is possible where a frame need only rewrite a portion of the pixels of the display, because the Image Descriptor can define a smaller rectangle to be rescanned instead of the whole image. Browsers or other displays that do not support animated GIFs typically show only the first frame.\n\nThe size and color quality of animated GIF files can vary significantly depending on the application used to create them. Strategies for minimizing file size include using a common global color table for all frames (rather than a complete local color table for each frame) and minimizing the number of pixels covered in successive frames (so that only the pixels that change from one frame to the next are included in the latter frame). Simply packing a series of independent frame images into a composite animation tends to yield large file sizes.\n\n[[Internet Explorer]] slows down GIFs if the frame-rate is 20 frames per second or higher and Microsoft reports that [[Google Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] also slow down some GIF animations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2010/06/07/trivia-animated-gif-timing/|title=Trivia: Animated GIF Timing|work=MSDN |publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=30 November 2018| date=7 June 2010|first=Eric |last=Law}}</ref>\n\nStarting in early 1995, the [[University of Ulm]] used animated GIF as live video streaming format to show a controllable model railroad.\n\n== Metadata ==\nMetadata can be stored in GIF files as a comment block, a plain text block, or an application-specific application extension block.  Several graphics editors use unofficial application extension blocks to include the data used to generate the image, so that it can be recovered for further editing.\n\nAll of these methods technically require the metadata to be broken into sub-blocks so that applications can navigate the metadata block without knowing its internal structure.\n\nThe [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) metadata standard introduced an unofficial but now widespread \"XMP Data\" application extension block for including XMP data in GIF files.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2016-08/XMPSpecificationPart3.pdf |title=XMP Specification Part 3: Storage In Files |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Adobe |pages=11\u201312 |access-date=16 August 2018 |quote=}}</ref> Since the XMP data is encoded using [[UTF-8]] without NUL characters, there are no 0 bytes in the data.

It also supports [[animation]]s and allows a separate [[palette (computing)|palette]] of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color. Unlike video, the GIF file format does not support audio.\n\nGIF images are compressed using the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) [[lossless data compression]] technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the [[software patent]] holder, [[Unisys]], and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.\n\n==History==\n{{See|#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|l1=Unisys and LZW patent enforcement}}\n\n[[CompuServe]] introduced GIF on June 15, 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier [[run-length encoding]] (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW data compression]], which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as those used by [[PCX]] and [[MacPaint]], and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow [[modem]]s.\n\nThe original version of GIF was called '''87a'''.<ref name=\"87aSpec\" /> In 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called '''89a''',<ref name=\"89aSpec\" /> which added support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six [[byte]]s of the file (the \"[[magic number (programming)|magic number]]\" or signature), which, when interpreted as [[ASCII]], read \"GIF87a\" and \"GIF89a\", respectively.\n\nCompuServe encouraged the adoption of GIF by providing downloadable conversion utilities for many computers. By December 1987, for example, an [[Apple IIGS]] user could view pictures created on an [[Atari ST]] or [[Commodore 64]].<ref name=\"caa198712\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Online Art | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | pages=10}}</ref> GIF was one of the first two image formats commonly used on Web sites, the other being the black-and-white [[XBM]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ajax: The Definitive Guide: Interactive Applications for the Web|last=Holdener III|first=Anthony|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2008|isbn=978-0596528386|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1995 [[Netscape (web browser)#Release history|Netscape Navigator]] 2.0 added [[#Animated GIF|the ability for animated GIFs to loop]].\n\nThe feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by control data, is used extensively on the Web to produce simple [[computer animation|animations]].

Many GIF files have a single image that fills the entire logical screen. Others divide the logical screen into separate sub-images. The images may also function as animation frames in an animated GIF file, but again these need not fill the entire logical screen.\n\nGIF files start with a fixed-length header (\"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\") giving the version, followed by a fixed-length Logical Screen Descriptor giving the pixel dimensions and other characteristics of the logical screen. The screen descriptor may also specify the presence and size of a Global Color Table, which follows next if present.\n<source lang=\"hexdump\" class=\"floatright\">\n00000000  47 49 46 38 39 61 01 00  01 00 80 00 00 00 00 00  |GIF89a..........|\n00000010  ff ff ff 21 f9 04 01 00  00 00 00 2c 00 00 00 00  |...!.......,....|\n00000020  01 00 01 00 00 02 01 44  00 3b                    |.......D.;|\n0000002a\n</source>\nThereafter, the file is divided into segments, each introduced by a 1-byte sentinel:\n* An image (introduced by 0x2C, an ASCII comma {{code|','}})\n* An extension block (introduced by 0x21, an ASCII exclamation point {{code|'!'}})\n* The trailer (a single byte of value 0x3B, an ASCII semicolon {{code|';'}}), which should be the last byte of the file.\n\nAn image starts with a fixed-length Image Descriptor, which may specify the presence and size of a Local Color Table (which follows next if present). The image data follows: one byte giving the bit width of the unencoded symbols (which must be at least 2 bits wide, even for bi-color images), followed by a linked list of sub-blocks containing the LZW-encoded data.\n\nExtension blocks (blocks that \"extend\" the 87a definition via a mechanism already defined in the 87a spec) consist of the sentinel, an additional byte specifying the type of extension, and a linked list of sub-blocks with the extension data. Extension blocks that modify an image (like the Graphic Control Extension that specifies the optional animation delay time and optional transparent background color) must immediately precede the segment with the image they refer to.\n\nThe linked lists used by the image data and the extension blocks consist of series of sub-blocks, each sub-block beginning with a byte giving the number of subsequent data bytes in the sub-block (1 to 255). The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a 0 byte).\n\nThis structure allows the file to be parsed even if not all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.\n\nThe full detail of the file format is covered in the GIF specification.<ref name=\"89aSpec\"/>\n\n==Palettes==\n[[File:Sunflower as gif websafe.gif|thumb|right|An example of a GIF image saved with a [[web-safe]] palette and dithered using the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg]] method. Due to the reduced number of colors in the image, there are display issues.]]\nGIF is palette-based: the colors used in an image (a frame) in the file have their [[RGB]] values defined in a [[Palette (computing)|palette table]] that can hold up to 256 entries, and the data for the image refer to the colors by their indices (0\u2013255) in the palette table. The color definitions in the palette can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (2<sup>24</sup> shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.\n\nEach frame can designate one index as a \"transparent background color\": any pixel assigned this index takes on the color of the pixel in the same position from the background, which may have been determined by a previous frame of animation.\n\nMany techniques, collectively called [[dithering]], have been developed to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of the GIF specification, dithering can be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy on the screen, and because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.\n\nIn the early days of graphical web browsers{{when|date=March 2015}}, graphics cards with 8-bit buffers (allowing only 256 colors) were common and it was fairly common to make GIF images using the [[Web-safe colors|websafe palette]].{{according_to_whom|date=March 2015}} This ensured predictable display, but severely limited the choice of colors. When 24-bit color became the norm palettes could instead be populated with the optimum colors for individual images.\n\nA small color table may suffice for small images, and keeping the color table small allows the file to be downloaded faster. Both the 87a and 89a specifications allow color tables of 2<sup>''n''</sup> colors for any ''n'' from 1 through 8. Most graphics applications will read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes; but some do not support all sizes when ''creating'' images. Tables of 2, 16, and 256 colors are widely supported.\n\n===True color===\n[[File:SmallFullColourGIF.gif|thumb|right|210px|An animated GIF illustrating a technique for displaying more than the typical limit of 256 colors]]\nAlthough GIF is almost never used for [[color depth#True color (24-bit)|true color]] images, it is possible to do so.<ref name=aminet>{{cite web |url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web |url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> A GIF image can include multiple image blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a \"transparent\" color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.\n\nTo render a full-color image as a GIF, the original image must be broken down into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks) the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.<ref name=aminet />\n\nSince each image block requires its own local color table, a GIF file having lots of image blocks can be very large, limiting the usefulness of full-color GIFs.<ref name=philhoward /> Additionally, not all GIF rendering programs handle tiled or layered images correctly. Many rendering programs interpret tiles or layers as animation frames and display them in sequence as an endless animation<ref name=aminet /> with most web browsers automatically displaying the frames with a delay time of 0.1 seconds or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser-compatibility|title=Nullsleep - Jeremiah Johnson - Animated GIF Minimum Frame Delay Browser Compatibility Study|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201034945/http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2017|title=They're different!

The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit size of the bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a \"little-Endian\" scheme: the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary. Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.\n\nThis byte stream is stored in the file as a series of \"sub-blocks\". Each sub-block has a maximum length 255 bytes and is prefixed with a byte indicating the number of data bytes in the sub-block. The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a single 0 byte, indicating a sub-block with 0 data bytes).\n\nFor the sample image above the reversible mapping between 9-bit codes and bytes is shown below.\n\n{| style=\"font-family:monospace; margin-left:2em\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! 9-bit code<br />(hex)\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"| Binary\n!

A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from the palette, with no output action as long as the local string can be found in a code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).\n\n                           '''Table           9-bit'''\n                      <u>'''string --> code      code    Action'''</u>\n                           #0 | 000h               Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                     palette  |  :\n                      colors  |  :\n                         #255 | 0FFh\n                          clr | 100h\n                          end | 101h\n                              |            100h     Clear\n Pixel          Local         |\n color Palette  string        |\n BLACK  #40     28            |            028h     1st pixel always to output\n WHITE  #255    FF            |                     String found in table\n                   28 FF      | 102h                Always add 1st string to table\n                FF            |                     Initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String not found in table\n                              |            0FFh     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF      | 103h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n BLACK  #40     FF FF 28      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF 28   | 104h                - add latest string to table\n                28            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    28 FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    28 FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            102h     - output code for previous string\n                   28 FF FF   | 105h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                              |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF FF   | 106h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String not found in table\n                              |            106h     - output code for previous string\n                   FF FF FF FF| 107h                - add latest string to table\n                FF            |                     - initialize local string\n WHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\n WHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String found in table\n                                                    No more pixels\n                                           107h     - output code for last string\n                                           101h     End\n\nFor clarity the table is shown above as being built of strings of increasing length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new string to be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.\n\nThe LZW algorithm requires a search of the table for each pixel. A linear search through up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some [[Successive approximation ADC|ADCs]]), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.\n\n===Image decoding===\nDecoding begins by mapping the stored bytes back to 9-bit codes. These are decoded to recover the pixel colors as shown below. A table identical to the one used in the encoder is built by adding strings by this rule:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Is incoming code found in table?\n|  {{Yes}} || add string for local code followed by first byte of string for incoming code\n|-\n|  {{No}}  || add string for local code followed by copy of its own first byte\n|}\n\n       '''shift'''\n '''9-bit ----> Local      Table                 Pixel'''\n <u>'''code        code   code --> string   Palette color  Action'''</u>\n 100h               000h  | #0                       Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                     :    | palette\n                     :    | colors\n                    0FFh  | #255\n                    100h  | clr\n                    101h  | end\n 028h                     |             #40   {{font color|WHITE|BLACK|BLACK}}  Decode 1st pixel\n 0FFh        028h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}   - output string from table\n                    102h  | 28 FF                     - add to table\n 103h        0FFh         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    103h  | FF FF                     - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 102h        103h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #40   {{font color|WHITE|BLACK|BLACK}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                    104h  | FF FF 28                  - add to table\n 103h        102h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                    105h  | 28 FF FF                  - add to table\n 106h        103h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    106h  | FF FF FF                  - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 107h        106h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                    107h  | FF FF FF FF               - add to table\n                          |                           - output string from table\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n                          |             #255  {{font color|BLACK|WHITE|WHITE}}\n 101h                     |                           End\n\n===LZW code lengths===\nShorter code lengths can be used for palettes smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.\n\nConversely, the symbol width could be set at 8, even if only values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a 2-color table. Although there would be no point in encoding the file that way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.\n\nThe code table initially contains codes that are one bit longer than the symbol size in order to accommodate the two special codes ''clr'' and ''end'' and codes for strings that are added during the process. When the table is full the code length increases to give space for more strings, up to a maximum code 4095 = FFF(hex). As the decoder builds its table it tracks these increases in code length and it is able to unpack incoming bytes accordingly.\n\n===Uncompressed GIF===\n[[File:Quilt design as 46x46 uncompressed GIF.gif|thumb|\nA 46 x 46 uncompressed GIF with 7-bit symbols (128 colors, 8-bit codes). Click on the image for an explanation of the code.]]\nThe GIF encoding process can be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally as a way to avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.\n\nThe modified encoding method ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices all of the compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.\n\nIf the symbol width is {{mvar|n}}, the codes of width {{math|''n''+1}} fall naturally into two blocks: the lower block of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} codes for coding single symbols, and the upper block of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} codes that will be used by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: {{math|2{{sup|''n''}}}} for CLEAR and {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} + 1}} for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, {{math|2<sup>''n''+1</sup> \u2212 1}}, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 3}} codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 2}} codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of {{math|2{{sup|''n''}} \u2212 2}} codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.\n\nFor the sample 3x5 image above, the following 9-bit codes represent \"clear\" (100) followed by image pixels in scan order and \"stop\" (101).\n\n 9-bit codes: 100 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 101\n\nAfter the above codes are mapped to bytes, the uncompressed file differs from the compressed file thus:\n<pre>\n :\n320: 14            20            20 bytes uncompressed image data follow\n321: 00 51 FC FB F7 0F C5 BF 7F FF FE FD FB F7 EF DF BF 7F 01 01\n335: 00                          - end\n :\n</pre>\n\n==Compression example==\nThe trivial example of a large image of solid color demonstrates the variable-length LZW compression used in GIF files.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Code\n! colspan=2 | Pixels\n!

A block of image data begins with a byte that declares the number of bytes to follow. The last block of data for an image is marked by a zero block-length byte.\n\n== Interlacing ==\nThe GIF Specification allows each image within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify that it is interlaced; i.e., that the order of the raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be recognized before the full image is painted.\n\nAn interlaced image is divided from top to bottom into strips 8 pixels high, and the rows of the image are presented in the following order:\n* Pass 1: Line 0 (the top-most line) from each strip.\n* Pass 2: Line 4 from each strip.\n* Pass 3: Lines 2 and 6 from each strip.\n* Pass 4: Lines 1, 3, 5, and 7 from each strip.\n\nThe pixels within each line are not interlaced, but presented consecutively from left to right. As with non-interlaced images, there is no break between the data for one line and the data for the next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the image's header block.\n\n==Animated GIF==\n<!--OTRS [[Ticket:2014021510009504]] gives permission for references to some GIFs, and code here.

To facilitate ''displaying'' animations, the GIF89a spec added the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows the images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays, forming a [[video clip]]. Each frame in an animation GIF is introduced by its own GCE specifying the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information at the start of the file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.\n\nBy default, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. To enable an animation to loop, [[Netscape]] in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |title=All About GIF89a\n |author=Royal Frazier\n |accessdate=7 January 2013\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990418091037/http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |archive-date=18 April 1999\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref> This block, placed immediately before the sequence of animation frames, specifies the number of times the sequence of frames should be played or that it should repeat continuously.

Some economy of data is possible where a frame need only rewrite a portion of the pixels of the display, because the Image Descriptor can define a smaller rectangle to be rescanned instead of the whole image. Browsers or other displays that do not support animated GIFs typically show only the first frame.\n\nThe size and color quality of animated GIF files can vary significantly depending on the application used to create them. Strategies for minimizing file size include using a common global color table for all frames (rather than a complete local color table for each frame) and minimizing the number of pixels covered in successive frames (so that only the pixels that change from one frame to the next are included in the latter frame). Simply packing a series of independent frame images into a composite animation tends to yield large file sizes.\n\n[[Internet Explorer]] slows down GIFs if the frame-rate is 20 frames per second or higher and Microsoft reports that [[Google Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] also slow down some GIF animations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2010/06/07/trivia-animated-gif-timing/|title=Trivia: Animated GIF Timing|work=MSDN |publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=30 November 2018| date=7 June 2010|first=Eric |last=Law}}</ref>\n\nStarting in early 1995, the [[University of Ulm]] used animated GIF as live video streaming format to show a controllable model railroad.\n\n== Metadata ==\nMetadata can be stored in GIF files as a comment block, a plain text block, or an application-specific application extension block.  Several graphics editors use unofficial application extension blocks to include the data used to generate the image, so that it can be recovered for further editing.\n\nAll of these methods technically require the metadata to be broken into sub-blocks so that applications can navigate the metadata block without knowing its internal structure.\n\nThe [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) metadata standard introduced an unofficial but now widespread \"XMP Data\" application extension block for including XMP data in GIF files.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2016-08/XMPSpecificationPart3.pdf |title=XMP Specification Part 3: Storage In Files |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Adobe |pages=11\u201312 |access-date=16 August 2018 |quote=}}</ref> Since the XMP data is encoded using [[UTF-8]] without NUL characters, there are no 0 bytes in the data. Rather than break the data into formal sub-blocks, the extension block terminates with a \"magic trailer\" that routes any application treating the data as sub-blocks to a final 0 byte that terminates the sub-block chain.\n\n== Unisys and LZW patent enforcement ==<!-- This section is linked from PNG -->\nIn 1977 and 1978, [[Jacob Ziv]] and [[Abraham Lempel]] published a pair of papers on a new class of lossless data-compression algorithms, now collectively referred to as [[LZ77 and LZ78]].

At the time, CompuServe was not aware of the patent.<ref name=\"PNG\" /> Unisys became aware that the version of GIF used the LZW compression technique and entered into licensing negotiations with CompuServe in January 1993. The subsequent agreement was announced on 24 December 1994.<ref name=\"KYZ\" /> Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services.<ref name=\"LPF\" />\n\nFollowing this announcement, there was widespread condemnation of CompuServe and Unisys, and many software developers threatened to stop using GIF.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

However, technical issues with the development of the GCT bogies means the train will not be available for service until at least 2025, requiring consideration of other options such as [[Tsubame (train)#Relay Tsubame|'relay']] service to ensure the line can open on schedule in fiscal 2022.<ref name=\"ajw.asahi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225105059/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |archivedate=25 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by 6.2% (9.6&nbsp;km), and while only 64% of the route will be built to full Shinkansen standards, it will eliminate the slowest sections of the existing narrow gauge route. Use of the GCT was estimated to result in a time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the current 12.8&nbsp;km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is proposed to be duplicated. However, due to the delay in the development of the GCT, the proposal has not advanced.\n\nWith the completion of excavation of the 1351m Enogushi tunnel, being the sixth tunnel completed in this section, approximately 25% of the 40.7&nbsp;km of tunnel excavation work on the Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki section has been finished.

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot. [[JR Central]] called the plan \"unrealistic\" due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Maehara sounds out JR Tokai over shinkansen link for Haneda airport|newspaper= Japan Today|date= 28 December 2009|url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/maehara-sounds-out-jr-tokai-over-shinkansen-link-for-haneda-airport|accessdate= 28 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!colspan=2|Speed\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Construction began/proposed\n!rowspan=2|Expected start of revenue services\n|-\n!km/h\n!mph\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n| [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] (West Kyushu Route)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|66.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2009 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] Phase 3 (Kanazawa \u2013 Tsuruga)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|120.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2012 \n|FY2023\n|-\n| [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] Phase 2 (Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto \u2013 Sapporo)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|211.3|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|2012 \n|FY2030\n|-\n| Hokuriku Shinkansen Phase 4 (Tsuruga \u2013 Obama \u2013 Kyoto \u2013 Shin-Osaka)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}} \n|2030 \n|FY2045\n|}\n\n== List of train types ==\nTrains are up to sixteen cars long.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started.

Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013.

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Osaka (515&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by ''Nozomi''); however, air travel has a certain share (~20\u201330%).\n* Tokyo \u2013 Okayama (676&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Hiroshima (821&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |title=Japanese airlines facing threat from below- Nikkei Asian Review |publisher=Asia.nikkei.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301141326/http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are ''Nozomi'' trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Fukuoka (1,069&nbsp;km): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest ''Nozomi'', and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Apart from this, this was Glass's most \"conventional\" opera orchestra until then (compared to ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', written for the six-piece [[Philip Glass Ensemble]], and ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'', scored for [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[string instrument|strings]] only).{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe opera is divided into three acts:\n\n=== Act 1: Year 1 of Akhnaten's Reign in Thebes ===\n''[[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[1370s BC|1370 BC]]''\n\n''Prelude, verse 1, verse 2, verse 3''\n\nSet in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[A minor]], the strings introduce a [[ground bass]] theme, with following variations. (A [[passacaglia]]). The scribe recites [[Pyramid Texts|funeral texts from the pyramids]]. \"Open are the double doors of the horizon; unlocked are its bolts.\"\n\n''Scene 1: Funeral of Akhnaten's father Amenhotep III''\n\nHeralded by hammering drums, Aye and a small male chorus chant a funeral hymn in Egyptian, later joined by the full chorus. The music is basically a march, based on the chords of [[A major]] and [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]] (with added [[major sixth]]),<ref>or its equivalent chord, B major 9</ref> and grows to ecstatic intensity towards the end.\n\n''Scene 2: The Coronation of Akhnaten''\n\nAfter a lengthy orchestral introduction, during which Akhnaten appears, heralded by a solo trumpet, the High Priest, Aye, and Horemhab sing a ritual text. After that, the Narrator recites a list of royal titles bestowed upon Akhnaten, while he is crowned. After the coronation, the chorus repeats the ritual text from the beginning of the scene. Again, the main key is A minor.\n\n''Scene 3: The Window of Appearances''\n\nAfter an introduction in A minor, dominated by [[tubular bells]], Akhnaten sings a praise to the Creator (in Egyptian) at the window of public appearances. This is the first time he actually sings, after he has already been on stage for 20 minutes (and 40 minutes into the opera) and the effect of his [[countertenor]] voice (which in 1983 was even more rare than nowadays) is startling. He is joined by Nefertiti, who actually sings lower notes than he, and later by Queen Tye, whose soprano soars high above the intertwining voices of the royal couple.\n\n=== Act 2: Years 5 to 15 in Thebes and Akhetaten ===\n''Scene 1: The Temple''\n\nThe scene opens again in A minor, with the High Priest and a group of priests singing a hymn to [[Amun]], principal god of the old order, in his temple. The music becomes increasingly dramatic, as Akhnaten, together with Queen Tye and his followers, attack the temple. This scene has only wordless singing. The harmonies grow very chromatic, finally reaching [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}} major]] and [[E minor]]. The temple roof is removed and the sun god [[Aten]]'s rays invade the temple, thus ending Amun's reign and laying the foundation for the worship of the only god Aten.\n\n''Scene 2: Akhnaten and [[Nefertiti]]''\n\nTwo solo celli introduce a \"love theme\". Accompanied by a solo trombone while the harmony switches to H(sus), the Narrator recites a prayer-like poem to the sun god. The strings softly take over the music in E minor, and the same poem is recited again, this time actually as a love poem from Akhnaten to Nefertiti. Then Akhnaten and Nefertiti sing the same text to each other (in Egyptian), as an intimate love duet. After a while, the trumpet associated with Akhnaten joins them as the highest voice, turning the duet into a trio.\n\n''Scene 3: The City \u2013 Dance''\n\nThe Narrator speaks a text taken from the boundary stones of the new capital of the empire, Akhet-Aten (The Horizon of Aten), describing the construction of the city, with large, light-filled spaces. After a brass fanfare, the completion of the city is celebrated in a light-hearted dance, contrasting with the stark, ritualistic music with which this act began. (In the Stuttgart premiere, the dance actually described the construction of the city.) The dance scene was omitted from the UK premiere production and its 1987 revival.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''Scene 4: Hymn''\n\nWhat now follows is a hymn to the only god Aten, a long [[aria]] (alternating between A minor and A major) by Akhnaten, and the central piece of the opera. Notably, it is the only text sung in the language of the audience, praising the sun giving life to everything. After the aria, an off-stage chorus sings [[Psalm 104]] in [[Hebrew]], dating some 400 years later, which has strong resemblances to Akhnaten's Hymn, thus emphasizing Akhnaten as the first founder of a [[monotheistic]] religion.\n\n=== Act 3: Year 17 and the Present ===\n''Akhnaten, [[1350s BC|1358 BC]]''\n\n''Scene 1: The Family''\n\nTwo oboes d'amore play the \"love theme\" from act 2. Akhnaten, Nefertiti and their six daughters, sing wordlessly in contemplation, they are oblivious to what happens outside of the palace. As the music switches from E minor to [[F minor]], the Narrator reads letters from [[Syria]]n vassals, asking for help against their enemies. Since the king does not send troops, his land is being seized and plundered by their enemies. The scene focuses again on Akhnaten and his family, still oblivious to the country falling apart.\n\n''Scene 2: The Attack and Fall of the City''\n\nThe music moves again to a vigorous F minor. Horemhab, Aye and the High Priest of Aten instigate the people (as the chorus), singing part of the vassal's letters (in their original [[Akkadian language]]) until finally the palace is attacked, the royal family killed, and the city of the sun destroyed.\n\n''Scene 3: The Ruins''\n\nThe music of the very beginning of the opera returns. The scribe recites an inscription on Aye's tomb, praising the death of \"the heretic\" and the new reign of the old gods. He then describes the restoration of Amun's temple by Akhnaten's son [[Tutankhamun]]. The Prelude music grows stronger and the scene moves to present-day Egypt, to the ruins of Amarna, the former capital Akhet-Aton. The Narrator appears as a modern tourist guide and speaks a text from a guide book, describing the ruins. \"There is nothing left of this glorious city of temples and palaces\".\n\n''Scene 4: Epilogue''\n\nThe ghosts of Akhnaten, Nefertiti and Queen Tye appear, singing wordlessly amongst the ruins. The funeral procession from the beginning of the opera appears on the horizon, and they join it. The music introduces a bass line from the beginning of ''Einstein on the Beach'', the first part of Glass's \"portrait\" trilogy (The second one being ''Satyagraha'' and the third one ''Akhnaten''), thus providing a musical bracket for the whole trilogy.\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n* Stuttgart State Theater, world premiere, programme (1984)\n* A Composer's Notes \u2013 Philip Glass and the Making of an Opera, Michael Blackwood (Director), (1985)\n* ENO, programme (1985)\n* ENO, programme (2016)\n* ENO, programme (2019)\n* CD booklet (Soloists, chorus and orchestra of the Stuttgart State Opera, [[Dennis Russell Davies]], cond., CBS 1987)\n* {{cite book |last1=Glass |first1=Philip |last2=Jones |first2=Robert T |title=Music by Philip Glass |date=1995 |publisher=Da Capo |isbn=978-0-306-80636-0 |oclc=424030462 |language=English}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Schwarz |first1=K.

Apart from this, this was Glass's most \"conventional\" opera orchestra until then (compared to ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', written for the six-piece [[Philip Glass Ensemble]], and ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'', scored for [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[string instrument|strings]] only).{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe opera is divided into three acts:\n\n=== Act 1: Year 1 of Akhnaten's Reign in Thebes ===\n''[[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[1370s BC|1370 BC]]''\n\n''Prelude, verse 1, verse 2, verse 3''\n\nSet in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[A minor]], the strings introduce a [[ground bass]] theme, with following variations. (A [[passacaglia]]). The scribe recites [[Pyramid Texts|funeral texts from the pyramids]]. \"Open are the double doors of the horizon; unlocked are its bolts.\"\n\n''Scene 1: Funeral of Akhnaten's father Amenhotep III''\n\nHeralded by hammering drums, Aye and a small male chorus chant a funeral hymn in Egyptian, later joined by the full chorus. The music is basically a march, based on the chords of [[A major]] and [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]] (with added [[major sixth]]),<ref>or its equivalent chord, B major 9</ref> and grows to ecstatic intensity towards the end.\n\n''Scene 2: The Coronation of Akhnaten''\n\nAfter a lengthy orchestral introduction, during which Akhnaten appears, heralded by a solo trumpet, the High Priest, Aye, and Horemhab sing a ritual text. After that, the Narrator recites a list of royal titles bestowed upon Akhnaten, while he is crowned. After the coronation, the chorus repeats the ritual text from the beginning of the scene. Again, the main key is A minor.\n\n''Scene 3: The Window of Appearances''\n\nAfter an introduction in A minor, dominated by [[tubular bells]], Akhnaten sings a praise to the Creator (in Egyptian) at the window of public appearances. This is the first time he actually sings, after he has already been on stage for 20 minutes (and 40 minutes into the opera) and the effect of his [[countertenor]] voice (which in 1983 was even more rare than nowadays) is startling. He is joined by Nefertiti, who actually sings lower notes than he, and later by Queen Tye, whose soprano soars high above the intertwining voices of the royal couple.\n\n=== Act 2: Years 5 to 15 in Thebes and Akhetaten ===\n''Scene 1: The Temple''\n\nThe scene opens again in A minor, with the High Priest and a group of priests singing a hymn to [[Amun]], principal god of the old order, in his temple. The music becomes increasingly dramatic, as Akhnaten, together with Queen Tye and his followers, attack the temple. This scene has only wordless singing. The harmonies grow very chromatic, finally reaching [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}} major]] and [[E minor]]. The temple roof is removed and the sun god [[Aten]]'s rays invade the temple, thus ending Amun's reign and laying the foundation for the worship of the only god Aten.\n\n''Scene 2: Akhnaten and [[Nefertiti]]''\n\nTwo solo celli introduce a \"love theme\". Accompanied by a solo trombone while the harmony switches to H(sus), the Narrator recites a prayer-like poem to the sun god. The strings softly take over the music in E minor, and the same poem is recited again, this time actually as a love poem from Akhnaten to Nefertiti. Then Akhnaten and Nefertiti sing the same text to each other (in Egyptian), as an intimate love duet. After a while, the trumpet associated with Akhnaten joins them as the highest voice, turning the duet into a trio.\n\n''Scene 3: The City \u2013 Dance''\n\nThe Narrator speaks a text taken from the boundary stones of the new capital of the empire, Akhet-Aten (The Horizon of Aten), describing the construction of the city, with large, light-filled spaces. After a brass fanfare, the completion of the city is celebrated in a light-hearted dance, contrasting with the stark, ritualistic music with which this act began. (In the Stuttgart premiere, the dance actually described the construction of the city.) The dance scene was omitted from the UK premiere production and its 1987 revival.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''Scene 4: Hymn''\n\nWhat now follows is a hymn to the only god Aten, a long [[aria]] (alternating between A minor and A major) by Akhnaten, and the central piece of the opera. Notably, it is the only text sung in the language of the audience, praising the sun giving life to everything. After the aria, an off-stage chorus sings [[Psalm 104]] in [[Hebrew]], dating some 400 years later, which has strong resemblances to Akhnaten's Hymn, thus emphasizing Akhnaten as the first founder of a [[monotheistic]] religion.\n\n=== Act 3: Year 17 and the Present ===\n''Akhnaten, [[1350s BC|1358 BC]]''\n\n''Scene 1: The Family''\n\nTwo oboes d'amore play the \"love theme\" from act 2. Akhnaten, Nefertiti and their six daughters, sing wordlessly in contemplation, they are oblivious to what happens outside of the palace. As the music switches from E minor to [[F minor]], the Narrator reads letters from [[Syria]]n vassals, asking for help against their enemies. Since the king does not send troops, his land is being seized and plundered by their enemies. The scene focuses again on Akhnaten and his family, still oblivious to the country falling apart.\n\n''Scene 2: The Attack and Fall of the City''\n\nThe music moves again to a vigorous F minor. Horemhab, Aye and the High Priest of Aten instigate the people (as the chorus), singing part of the vassal's letters (in their original [[Akkadian language]]) until finally the palace is attacked, the royal family killed, and the city of the sun destroyed.\n\n''Scene 3: The Ruins''\n\nThe music of the very beginning of the opera returns. The scribe recites an inscription on Aye's tomb, praising the death of \"the heretic\" and the new reign of the old gods. He then describes the restoration of Amun's temple by Akhnaten's son [[Tutankhamun]]. The Prelude music grows stronger and the scene moves to present-day Egypt, to the ruins of Amarna, the former capital Akhet-Aton. The Narrator appears as a modern tourist guide and speaks a text from a guide book, describing the ruins. \"There is nothing left of this glorious city of temples and palaces\".\n\n''Scene 4: Epilogue''\n\nThe ghosts of Akhnaten, Nefertiti and Queen Tye appear, singing wordlessly amongst the ruins. The funeral procession from the beginning of the opera appears on the horizon, and they join it. The music introduces a bass line from the beginning of ''Einstein on the Beach'', the first part of Glass's \"portrait\" trilogy (The second one being ''Satyagraha'' and the third one ''Akhnaten''), thus providing a musical bracket for the whole trilogy.\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n* Stuttgart State Theater, world premiere, programme (1984)\n* A Composer's Notes \u2013 Philip Glass and the Making of an Opera, Michael Blackwood (Director), (1985)\n* ENO, programme (1985)\n* ENO, programme (2016)\n* ENO, programme (2019)\n* CD booklet (Soloists, chorus and orchestra of the Stuttgart State Opera, [[Dennis Russell Davies]], cond., CBS 1987)\n* {{cite book |last1=Glass |first1=Philip |last2=Jones |first2=Robert T |title=Music by Philip Glass |date=1995 |publisher=Da Capo |isbn=978-0-306-80636-0 |oclc=424030462 |language=English}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Schwarz |first1=K.
