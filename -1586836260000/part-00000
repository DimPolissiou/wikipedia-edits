''Billboard'' continued to run regional and city-specific charts throughout 1975 and 1976 until the issue dated August 28, 1976, when a 30-position ''National Disco Action Top 30'' premiered.  This quickly expanded to 40 positions, then in 1979 the chart expanded to 60 positions, then 80, and eventually reached 100 positions from 1979 until 1981, when it was reduced to 80 again.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003|isbn=0-89820-156-X|publisher=Record Research|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 1980s the chart maintained 80 slots until March 16, 1985 when the Disco charts were splintered and renamed.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.

Her song \"[[Better than Today]]\" was number-one while \"[[Higher (Taio Cruz song)|Higher]]\", a song by [[Taio Cruz]] on which Minogue features, was number three. On July 28, 2016, [[Rihanna]] became the second act to achieve this when her songs \"[[Kiss It Better (Rihanna song)|Kiss It Better]]\" and \"[[Needed Me]]\" were number one and three concurrently, however it made her the first act to have two songs in the top three as the lead act on both. [[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.  In 1978, four tracks from ''[[Thank God It's Friday (soundtrack)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' ([[Donna Summer]], [[Pattie Brooks]], [[Love & Kisses]], [[Sunshine (American band)|Sunshine]]); in 1980, three tracks from ''[[Fame (soundtrack)|Fame]]'' (two by [[Irene Cara]] and one by [[Linda Clifford]]); and in 1985, two songs from ''[[Beverly Hills Cop#Soundtrack|Beverly Hills Cop]]'' ([[Patti LaBelle]], [[Harold Faltermeyer]]) hit number one together.\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] additionally became the first act to have scored at least one No. 1 on the Dance Club Songs chart in five separate decades since the chart's inception in 1976, having tallied 9 in the 1980s, 13 in the '90s, 18 in the 2000s, 9 in the '10s and, now, one (so far) in the '20s.\n*[[The Trammps]] are the only act to replace themselves at number one (issue date June 5, 1976, \"That's Where the Happy People Go\" \u2192 \"Disco Party\").<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The longest running number-ones on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart are \"[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]{{sup|2}} in 1975 and the album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]].

Rimes, who had several remixes of her country hits reach the dance chart, achieved that distinction during the week of February 28, 2009, when the [[electronic dance music]] [[remix]]es of her 2008 single \"[[What I Cannot Change]]\" reached number one.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/lifestyles/trying-follow-garth%E2%80%99s-martina%E2%80%99s-footprints|title=Trying to follow in Garth's, Martina's footprints|date=January 15, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2012|work=The Nashville City Paper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514234121/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/lifestyles/trying-follow-garth%E2%80%99s-martina%E2%80%99s-footprints|archive-date=May 14, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7701883/dance-club-songs-leann-rimes-long-live-love \"LeAnn Rimes Rules Dance Club Songs With 'Long Live Love'\"] from ''Billboard'' (February 22, 2017)</ref>\n*[[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Chloe Lattanzi]]'s collaboration with Dave Aud\u00e9, \"[[You Have to Believe]]\", which reached number one in its November 21, 2015 issue, made history for Newton-John and Lattanzi, as they became the first mother-daughter duo to reach number one on this chart as well as picking up their first number ones at Dance Club Songs as well, although Newton-John had charted four times prior to this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6762259/olivia-newton-john-first-number-1-dance-club-songs-chart|title=Olivia Newton-John Logs First No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart|work=Billboard|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] has the distinction of being the only artist to reach number one twice on this chart with a song he recorded and re-recorded, as his original version of \"[[Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing)]]\" featuring [[Twista]] reached that position in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-08-14/dance-club-play-songs |title=Hot Dance Club Songs, Billboard.com, issue date August 14, 2004 |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2004-08-14 |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> and again in 2016 as a featured duet with [[Myl\u00e8ne Farmer]] for \"[[Stolen Car (Myl\u00e8ne Farmer song)|Stolen Car]]\".
