His father, Thomas, was a ''Cittizen and Joyner of London'', and Giles may have been related to [[Thomas Farnaby]] (c. 1575\u20131647), the famous schoolmaster of Kent, whose father was a carpenter. But it was his cousin Nicholas Farnaby (c. 1560\u20131630), who may have turned him to music.

The couple had a daughter, Philadelphia, baptised on 8 August 1591, when the Farnabys moved to the neighbouring parish of St. Peter's, Westcheap, and later a son, Richard Farnaby (1594\u20131623).

All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated. \n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.

Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated. \n\n==International Peace Work==\n\nIn 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative<ref name=\"Concordisinternational\">{{cite web|url=http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|title=Concordis 1987-1991|website=Concordis International|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015004015/http://concordis-international.org/about-us/south-africa-1987-1991/|archive-date=2014-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Endgame\">{{citation|last=Esterhuyse|first=Willie|title=Endgame: Secret Talks and the End of Apartheid|date=April 17, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2dRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=endgame+secret+apartheid#v=onepage&q=endgame%20secret%20apartheid&f=false|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-6240-5427-6}}</ref> (NPI) in [[South Africa]], which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement.<ref name=\"Newick Park\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/history-newick-park-initiative-jeremy-ive/|title=History of the Newick Park Initiative|last1=Ive|first1=Jeremy|website=Jubilee Centre|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> NPI\u2019s director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. \n\nThe work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] there,<ref name=\"Rwandafood\">{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Newick Park Initiative: Policy priorities to achieve agricultural growth in Rwanda|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.grandslacs.net/ContentPages/797071061.pdf}}</ref> followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.<ref>Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010.

He was a renowned keyboard performer of the [[virginalist]] school and most of his compositions were written for this medium.\n\n==Life==\nBull's place of birth is shrouded in uncertainty. In an article published in 1952, [[Thurston Dart]] presumed that Bull's family originated in [[Somerset]], where it is possible the composer was born. It was the 17th-century antiquarian [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] who first proposed that he was related to the Bull family of Peglich, Somerset, but in 1959 Dart wrote that Bull was ''probably the son of a London goldsmith\u2026''.<ref>Thurston Dart: ''Search for the Real John Bull''. New York Times, 1 November 1959, sec. 2, p.1</ref> Then, in the second edition of his ''Calendar of the Life of John Bull'', Dart proposed [[Hereford]] as a third possibility.<ref>''John Bull: Keyboard Music''. Calendar of the Life of John Bull, compiled by [[Thurston Dart]], vol I, p. xxi.</ref> More recent research by [[Susi Jeans]] suggests that Bull was born in the [[Radnorshire]] parish of [[Old Radnor]] within the diocese of Hereford, although no birth records have yet been discovered. Bull's appointment as organist of [[Hereford Cathedral]] in 1582 lends credence to this diocese being his place of birth: it was customary at this time for organists to return to their home cathedrals after training in London (cf: [[Thomas Morley]]).\n\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hereford Cathedral.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Hereford Cathedral, 17th-century engraving]]\n\nIn 1573 he joined the choir at Hereford Cathedral, and the next year joined the Children of the [[Chapels Royal#United Kingdom|Chapel Royal]] in London, where he studied with [[John Blitheman]] and [[William Hunnis]]; in addition to singing he learned to play the organ at this time.

Fearful of losing his readership because his assigned rooms were still occupied by [[Thomas Gresham]]'s stepson, William Reade, he forced an entry to the rooms by engaging a mason to help him break down a wall, which led to an action against Bull in [[Star Chamber]]. The outcome of this case is not known.

He left many compositions for keyboard, some of which were collected in the ''[[Fitzwilliam Virginal Book]]''.\n\nHis first (and only) publication, in 1612 or 1613, was a contribution of seven pieces forming part of a collection of virginal music entitled ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]], or the Maydenhead of the First Musicke That Ever Was Printed for the Virginalls,'' dedicated to the 15-year-old [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]], who was his student, on the occasion of her betrothal to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] of the Rhine.  The other contributors to ''Parthenia'' were Bull's contemporaries [[William Byrd]] and [[Orlando Gibbons]], among the most famous composers of the age. Bull also wrote an anthem, ''God the father, God the son,'' for the wedding in 1613 of the princess and the Elector Palatine.\n\nIn addition to his keyboard compositions, he wrote verse [[anthem]]s, [[canon (music)|canon]]s and other works.\n\nHis 5-part anthem ''Almighty God, which by the Leading of a Star'', known colloquially as the ''Star Anthem'', was the most popular [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[verse anthem]], occurring in more contemporary sources than any other.\n\nMuch of his music was lost when he fled England; some was destroyed, and some was stolen by other composers, though occasionally such misattributions can be corrected today based on stylistic grounds.

He was a renowned keyboard performer of the [[virginalist]] school and most of his compositions were written for this medium.\n\n==Life==\nBull's place of birth is shrouded in uncertainty. In an article published in 1952, [[Thurston Dart]] presumed that Bull's family originated in [[Somerset]], where it is possible the composer was born. It was the 17th-century antiquarian [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] who first proposed that he was related to the Bull family of Peglich, Somerset, but in 1959 Dart wrote that Bull was ''probably the son of a London goldsmith\u2026''.<ref>Thurston Dart: ''Search for the Real John Bull''. New York Times, 1 November 1959, sec. 2, p.1</ref> Then, in the second edition of his ''Calendar of the Life of John Bull'', Dart proposed [[Hereford]] as a third possibility.<ref>''John Bull: Keyboard Music''. Calendar of the Life of John Bull, compiled by [[Thurston Dart]], vol I, p. xxi.</ref> More recent research by [[Susi Jeans]] suggests that Bull was born in the [[Radnorshire]] parish of [[Old Radnor]] within the diocese of Hereford, although no birth records have yet been discovered. Bull's appointment as organist of [[Hereford Cathedral]] in 1582 lends credence to this diocese being his place of birth: it was customary at this time for organists to return to their home cathedrals after training in London (cf: [[Thomas Morley]]).\n\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hereford Cathedral.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Hereford Cathedral, 17th-century engraving]]\n\nIn 1573 he joined the choir at Hereford Cathedral, and the next year joined the Children of the [[Chapels Royal#United Kingdom|Chapel Royal]] in London, where he studied with [[John Blitheman]] and [[William Hunnis]]; in addition to singing he learned to play the organ at this time. After being appointed to the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylor's Company]] in 1577\u201378, Bull received his first appointment as organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1582, and then became [[Master of the Children]] there.\n\nIn 1586 he received his degree from [[Oxford University|Oxford]], and he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal that same year.

Ban Me Thuot controlled Highways 14 and 21, vital lines of communication from the southern Central Highlands to Saigon and the coast.\n\nOn the night of 9 March 1975, the PAVN struck the city and Pleiku airfield with artillery, mortars, and rockets. By the next afternoon, over half of Ban Me Thuot was in enemy hands, despite fierce resistance from ARVN defenders. RVNAF air strikes destroyed five PAVN tanks but during one strike, a bomb accidentally hit ARVN sector headquarters severely disrupting communications.\n\nAt Pleiku airfield, the small ARVN garrison came under attack and was forced to defend the control tower, preventing attempts to fly in reinforcements. ARVN reinforcements were diverted to Buon Ho, north of the city, far from the battle. On the airfield, the PAVN had destroyed an O-1, a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47]], and ten UH-1s, although three damaged UH-1s had managed to escape. Fierce fighting continued for three more days but by 14 March the situation was hopeless. During the four-day battle the RVNAF flew over 200 sorties, inflicting heavy losses on the PAVN, but to no avail. No aircraft were lost in the air, but three A-37s at Pleiku were destroyed by 122&nbsp;mm rockets on 11 March when the PAVN rocketed the airfield.\n\nThe day Ban Me Thuot fell, President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] called an emergency high level meeting at [[Cam Ranh Bay]]. During this meeting Thieu made the decision to attempt an orderly withdrawal from the Central Highlands around Kontum and Pleiku in order to conserve forces and regroup for a counter-attack. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, the commander of the region, General [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Ph\u00fa]], misinterpreted this order and directed an immediately evacuation of both cities. The commander of the 6th Air Division at Pleiku, BG Pham Ngoc Sang was given forty-eight hours to evacuate the airfield and immediately requested UH-1s, CH-47s, and C-130s to fly RVNAF personnel and their dependants out of Pleiku.<ref name=Lavalle/>{{rp|74-5}}\n\nOn 16 March artillery fire began hitting the city and ARVN troops began a retreat to the coast along Highway 7B.

It was established by the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) in 1962 at an undeveloped airstrip, and was used by the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Vietnam War]] in the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps Tactical Zone]] of South Vietnam. It was captured by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) in March 1975 and was abandoned for many years. Today, the facility has been redeveloped as [[Pleiku Airport]].\n\n==Origins==\nIn January 1962, the U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] in Vietnam requested the Department of Defense contract construction agent, the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Officer in Charge of Construction RVN]] (OICC), to design and construct a {{convert|6000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway at Pleiku. The MAAG wanted the air field to be operational as a top priority by 1 July 1962.

They were founder members of the [[English Premier Ice Hockey League]] but have competed in the NIHL since 2012. Their development team was the Romford Spitfires, which played in Division 2 of the NIHL before being succeeded in 2009/10 by the '''Romford Fury'''.\n\nThe team moved to Leyton, East London, in 2013, when it adopted the new name '''London Raiders'''. Its team colours are white, gold and blue, and fans of the team are known as the Gold and Blue Army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/goldandbluearmy?lang=en|title=Gold and Blue Army (@Goldandbluearmy) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>  The team returned to Romford in 2018, keeping the London Raiders name.\n\nThe team is often confused for London Raiders softball club, which is an LGBT+ club formed in the late 1980s. One time, the head of London Raiders Ice Hockey was so confused between the two that they signed up for an iTunes account with a London Raiders Softball email address.\n\n==History==\n[[File:LondonRaidersLogo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|A version of the Raiders crest used from 2013 to 2018]]\n\nThe club was founded in 1987 under the name '''[[Romford Raiders]]''' and coached by Gord Jeffrey, who went on to become a hero amongst the Romford fans.\n\nSome of the best-known players to play for the Raiders include Rob Stewart,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=64908|title=Rob Stewart|website=Elite Prospects|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> Dave Whistle<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/staff.php?staff=3602|title=David Whistle Team Staff Profile|website=www.eliteprospects.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> and Mike Ellis,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=33616|title=Mike Ellis hockey statistics and profile at hockeydb.com|website=www.hockeydb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> all of whom went on to play and coach at the highest levels in the UK.\n\nThe Raiders' first ever match was played on 13 September 1987, against the [[Oxford City Stars]]. Romford's first captain, Erskine Douglas, also scored the Raiders' first ever goal.\n\nOn 28 November 2010, during an English National League game against the [[Bracknell Hornets]], Danny Marshall scored his 1,232nd point as a Raider when he assisted on a short-handed goal by Frankie Harvey. With that point, Marshall became the club's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Gord Jeffrey's long-standing record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/team_all-time_stats.php?team=17163&alltime=A&seasontype=|title=Elite Prospects - Players' All-Time Stats for London Raiders|website=www.eliteprospects.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Romford Ice Arena]] was sold by Havering Council to investors.

London would come back to win 5\u20132 against the Cardiff Fire in front of a sell-out crowd.

They were founder members of the [[English Premier Ice Hockey League]] but have competed in the NIHL since 2012. Their development team was the Romford Spitfires, which played in Division 2 of the NIHL before being succeeded in 2009/10 by the '''Romford Fury'''.\n\nThe team moved to Leyton, East London, in 2013, when it adopted the new name '''London Raiders'''. Its team colours are white, gold and blue, and fans of the team are known as the Gold and Blue Army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/goldandbluearmy?lang=en|title=Gold and Blue Army (@Goldandbluearmy) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>  The team returned to Romford in 2018, keeping the London Raiders name.\n\nThe team is often confused for London Raiders softball club, which is an LGBT+ club formed in the late 1980s. One time, the head of London Raiders Ice Hockey was so confused between the two that they signed up for an iTunes account with a London Raiders Softball email address.\n\n==History==\n[[File:LondonRaidersLogo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|A version of the Raiders crest used from 2013 to 2018]]\n\nThe club was founded in 1987 under the name '''[[Romford Raiders]]''' and coached by Gord Jeffrey, who went on to become a hero amongst the Romford fans.\n\nSome of the best-known players to play for the Raiders include Rob Stewart,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=64908|title=Rob Stewart|website=Elite Prospects|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> Dave Whistle<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/staff.php?staff=3602|title=David Whistle Team Staff Profile|website=www.eliteprospects.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> and Mike Ellis,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=33616|title=Mike Ellis hockey statistics and profile at hockeydb.com|website=www.hockeydb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> all of whom went on to play and coach at the highest levels in the UK.\n\nThe Raiders' first ever match was played on 13 September 1987, against the [[Oxford City Stars]]. Romford's first captain, Erskine Douglas, also scored the Raiders' first ever goal.\n\nOn 28 November 2010, during an English National League game against the [[Bracknell Hornets]], Danny Marshall scored his 1,232nd point as a Raider when he assisted on a short-handed goal by Frankie Harvey. With that point, Marshall became the club's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Gord Jeffrey's long-standing record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/team_all-time_stats.php?team=17163&alltime=A&seasontype=|title=Elite Prospects - Players' All-Time Stats for London Raiders|website=www.eliteprospects.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Romford Ice Arena]] was sold by Havering Council to investors. The team subsequently had to move to [[Lee Valley Ice Centre]] and became the London Raiders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icenationuk.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/nihl-romford-raiders-find-salvation-in-their-darkest-hour/|title=NIHL News \u2013 Romford Raiders Find Salvation In Their Darkest Hour|website=Ice Nation UK|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nOn February 3, 2018, the Raiders' played their first game at their new home back in Romford, the Sapphire Ice and Leisure Centre. London would come back to win 5\u20132 against the Cardiff Fire in front of a sell-out crowd. Former Romford Junior Olegs Lascenko scored the teams first ever goal at the new venue, however, it was Cardiff's Jackson Price who scored the first goal overall. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/sport/lascenko-leaves-mark-on-history-with-first-raiders-goal-on-new-romford-ice-1-5387960|title=Romford Recorder -
