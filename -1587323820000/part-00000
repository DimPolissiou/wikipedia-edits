However, he is much darker, in clothing and humor, when [[Quasimodo]] and [[Captain Phoebus]] arrive in the Court of Miracles, suggesting his personality during the day to have been something of a [[Masking (personality)|fa\u00e7ade]]. However, he shows to have a gentle nature at the end of the film when he picks a little girl up and entertains her with a puppet resembling [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]]. Clopin's ending pitch of the song \"[[The Bells of Notre Dame]]\" has garnered incredible acclaim for its high D-note singing. He is voiced by [[Paul Kandel]] and animated by Michael Surrey.\n\nAs well as narrating the whole film, Clopin introduces the film and begins the story with the song \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" where he introduces the audience to the story by explaining how Quasimodo, the bell ringer from Notre Dame, ended up there. He also sings \"[[Topsy Turvy (song)|Topsy Turvy]]\" about the traditional Parisian \"[[Feast of Fools]],\" also known as [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] held every year on January 6.\n\nClopin wears two main costumes during the film: a [[jester]] suit (seen to the right), which he wears at the Festival of Fools; he also wears a similar costume in the [[catacombs]], but it is almost completely purple with no gold trim, no mask, and no bells. In \"The Court of Miracles,\" he wears a lawyer's outfit, a judge's outfit (resembling Frollo's), and an executioner's outfit for brief periods of time.\n\nAs the movie's narrator, Clopin has a great deal of knowledge about Quasimodo's past, seemingly more than Quasimodo himself. This suggests that to know the whole story, throughout Paris he must have many contacts. Clopin's age is never estimated, so it is unknown if he was a child or at least old enough to hear about the murder of Quasimodo's mother.\n\nNot only is Clopin the narrator in the story, but he is also the King of the Gypsies, who at the time were being rounded up and murdered in an act of \"purification\" by Frollo.\n\n===Original film===\nClopin appears in the film five times. The first appearance is when Clopin sings \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" which tells the tale of how Frollo killed Quasimodo's mother, but was stopped by the Archdeacon before he could kill the infant Quasimodo by drowning him in a well.\n\nThe second appearance is at the Festival of Fools, where he acts as the [[Lord of Misrule]], or [[master of ceremonies]], sings \"Topsy Turvy,\" a dance number that explains that it is \"the day we do the things that we deplore on the other three-hundred-and-sixty-four.\" It is also during this song that he crowns Quasimodo the \"King of Fools.\"\n\nHis third appearance is much later in the film, at the Court of Miracles, where a much darker side to his personality is shown. He and a large group of gypsies believe Quasimodo and Phoebus to be spies. They sing the song \"The Court of Miracles\" as Clopin puts Quasimodo and Phoebus on \"trial\" which includes a jury consisting of a puppet crafted in Clopin's likeness. He eventually finds them \"totally innocent, which is the worst crime of all.\" He prepares to hang them, but [[Esmeralda (Disney)|Esmeralda]] arrives in time to stop him and tell the gypsies of their good intentions, explaining how Phoebus rescued the miller and his family from being burned by Frollo and how Quasimodo helped her escape the cathedral. Clopin, forgetting that he'd gagged Quasimodo and Phoebus, humorously asks why they didn't just say so. Phoebus informs the gypsy people to leave, saying that Frollo knows of their hideout, a statement confirmed by Quasimodo, who was told of this by Frollo before. Realizing this, all the gypsies (including Clopin) agree and prepare to leave Paris, but unfortunately, Frollo arrives just in time to attack the Court of Miracles and Clopin is seen with his people struggling to break free from their bonds to no avail.\n\nHis fourth appearance is briefly during the climax of the film where Esmeralda is at the scaffold before Notre Dame. When Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda, Phoebus breaks free and rouses the civilians into action, inciting them to release the gypsies and help them protect the cathedral from Frollo's soldiers. Clopin is seen jumping out of one of the many cages that hold the gypsies freed by the civilians. Along with the civilians and French army, they attack Frollo's soldiers.\n\nHis fifth and final appearance is at the end, where Quasimodo is escorted out from the cathedral to be praised by the people for his actions. Having developed a newfound respect for Quasimodo, Clopin happily declares \"Three cheers for Quasimodo!\" He then sings a reprise of \"The Bells of Notre Dame\" while entertaining one of the young children as the civilians finally cheer Quasimodo, accepting him into their society.\n\n===Sequel===\nClopin also appeared in the straight-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', as the host for the Festival of Love (Le Jour D'Amour, \"the day of love\"), although he is no longer the narrator and plays a much smaller role.\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trouillefou, Clopin}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional clowns]]\n[[Category:Fictional singers]]\n[[Category:Fictional dancers]]\n[[Category:Fictional kings]]\n[[Category:Fictional tribal chiefs]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romani people]]\n[[Category:Fictional jesters]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Primary sources|date=January 2008}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Clopin Trouillefou\n| series             = [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\n| creator            = [[Victor Hugo]]\n| gender             = Male\n| nationality        = [[Romani people|Romani]]\n}}\n\n'''Clopin Trouillefou''' ({{IPA-fr|kl\u0254.p\u025b\u0303 t\u0281uj.fu|pron}}, literally \"Lame Fear-Fool\") is a fictional character first created in the 1831 novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' by French author [[Victor Hugo]], and subsequently adapted.\n\n==In the novel==\nIn the story, Clopin disrupts [[Pierre Gringoire]]'s play, begging the audience for money.

Finally, the author notes that Clopin dies courageously during the attack.\n\n==Adaptations==\nAmong the actors who have played Clopin over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

However, he is much darker, in clothing and humor, when [[Quasimodo]] and [[Captain Phoebus]] arrive in the Court of Miracles, suggesting his personality during the day to have been something of a [[Masking (personality)|fa\u00e7ade]]. However, he shows to have a gentle nature at the end of the film when he picks a little girl up and entertains her with a puppet resembling [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]]. Clopin's ending pitch of the song \"[[The Bells of Notre Dame]]\" has garnered incredible acclaim for its high D-note singing. He is voiced by [[Paul Kandel]] and animated by Michael Surrey.\n\nAs well as narrating the whole film, Clopin introduces the film and begins the story with the song \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" where he introduces the audience to the story by explaining how Quasimodo, the bell ringer from Notre Dame, ended up there. He also sings \"[[Topsy Turvy (song)|Topsy Turvy]]\" about the traditional Parisian \"[[Feast of Fools]],\" also known as [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] held every year on January 6.\n\nClopin wears two main costumes during the film: a [[jester]] suit (seen to the right), which he wears at the Festival of Fools; he also wears a similar costume in the [[catacombs]], but it is almost completely purple with no gold trim, no mask, and no bells. In \"The Court of Miracles,\" he wears a lawyer's outfit, a judge's outfit (resembling Frollo's), and an executioner's outfit for brief periods of time.\n\nAs the movie's narrator, Clopin has a great deal of knowledge about Quasimodo's past, seemingly more than Quasimodo himself. This suggests that to know the whole story, throughout Paris he must have many contacts. Clopin's age is never estimated, so it is unknown if he was a child or at least old enough to hear about the murder of Quasimodo's mother.\n\nNot only is Clopin the narrator in the story, but he is also the King of the Gypsies, who at the time were being rounded up and murdered in an act of \"purification\" by Frollo.\n\n===Original film===\nClopin appears in the film five times. The first appearance is when Clopin sings \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" which tells the tale of how Frollo killed Quasimodo's mother, but was stopped by the Archdeacon before he could kill the infant Quasimodo by drowning him in a well.\n\nThe second appearance is at the Festival of Fools, where he acts as the [[Lord of Misrule]], or [[master of ceremonies]], sings \"Topsy Turvy,\" a dance number that explains that it is \"the day we do the things that we deplore on the other three-hundred-and-sixty-four.\" It is also during this song that he crowns Quasimodo the \"King of Fools.\"\n\nHis third appearance is much later in the film, at the Court of Miracles, where a much darker side to his personality is shown. He and a large group of gypsies believe Quasimodo and Phoebus to be spies. They sing the song \"The Court of Miracles\" as Clopin puts Quasimodo and Phoebus on \"trial\" which includes a jury consisting of a puppet crafted in Clopin's likeness. He eventually finds them \"totally innocent, which is the worst crime of all.\" He prepares to hang them, but [[Esmeralda (Disney)|Esmeralda]] arrives in time to stop him and tell the gypsies of their good intentions, explaining how Phoebus rescued the miller and his family from being burned by Frollo and how Quasimodo helped her escape the cathedral. Clopin, forgetting that he'd gagged Quasimodo and Phoebus, humorously asks why they didn't just say so. Phoebus informs the gypsy people to leave, saying that Frollo knows of their hideout, a statement confirmed by Quasimodo, who was told of this by Frollo before. Realizing this, all the gypsies (including Clopin) agree and prepare to leave Paris, but unfortunately, Frollo arrives just in time to attack the Court of Miracles and Clopin is seen with his people struggling to break free from their bonds to no avail.\n\nHis fourth appearance is briefly during the climax of the film where Esmeralda is at the scaffold before Notre Dame. When Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda, Phoebus breaks free and rouses the civilians into action, inciting them to release the gypsies and help them protect the cathedral from Frollo's soldiers. Clopin is seen jumping out of one of the many cages that hold the gypsies freed by the civilians. Along with the civilians and French army, they attack Frollo's soldiers.\n\nHis fifth and final appearance is at the end, where Quasimodo is escorted out from the cathedral to be praised by the people for his actions. Having developed a newfound respect for Quasimodo, Clopin happily declares \"Three cheers for Quasimodo!\" He then sings a reprise of \"The Bells of Notre Dame\" while entertaining one of the young children as the civilians finally cheer Quasimodo, accepting him into their society.\n\n===Sequel===\nClopin also appeared in the straight-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', as the host for the Festival of Love (Le Jour D'Amour, \"the day of love\"), although he is no longer the narrator and plays a much smaller role.\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trouillefou, Clopin}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional clowns]]\n[[Category:Fictional singers]]\n[[Category:Fictional dancers]]\n[[Category:Fictional kings]]\n[[Category:Fictional tribal chiefs]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romani people]]\n[[Category:Fictional jesters]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n", "name_user": "WikiLover4Ever", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor little correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopin_Trouillefou"}

It was the band's breakthrough album, establishing M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce as one of the top selling heavy metal acts of the 1980s. The singles \"[[Looks That Kill]]\" and \"[[Too Young to Fall in Love]]\" were moderate hits for the band.\n\n==Overview==\n''Shout at the Devil'' was M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's breakthrough success, selling 200,000 copies in its first two weeks.<ref name=\"sentinel\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/festivals/37-outrageous-stories-about-mtley-cre-b99296502z1-265704851.html |last1 = Levy | first1 = Piet  |title=37 outrageous stories about M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce |publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |accessdate=August 4, 2019 }}</ref>  The album's title and the band's use of a [[Pentagram#Satanism|Pentagram]] caused a great deal of controversy upon its 1983 release, as [[Christianity|Christian]] and conservative groups claimed the band was encouraging their listeners to worship [[Satan]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Jarriel|title=The Devil Worshippers|work=20/20|date=May 16, 1985}}</ref> The Pentagram was something [[Nikki Sixx]] brought with him from [[Sister (band)|Sister]], a very theatrical band he had been a member of (along with future [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] vocalist [[Blackie Lawless]]) in the late 70s prior to the formation of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Sister were the first L.A. band to fuse [[Occult|occult symbolism]] such as the Pentagram into a theatrical heavy metal show incorporating blood and facial [[makeup]]. Sixx asked Lawless for permission to use some of Sister's occult-related imagery for ''Shout at the Devil'', as at that point Lawless was intent on moving in a different direction. \"I said 'take whatever you want' because at that point, I realised that with an image like that, you end up painting yourself in a corner and you can't get out,\" said Lawless.<ref name=\"wasp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.waspnation.com/bitsandbobs.html |title=Facts & Rumours |publisher=waspnation.com |accessdate=August 4, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nJust prior to returning home to Los Angeles to begin recording the album, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was famously kicked off their support spot on [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' tour. The bands played only five shows together before [[Gene Simmons]] demanded they be replaced, citing their \"bad behavior\".<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nDuring recording, bassist Sixx was involved in a serious car crash after drunkenly stealing a friend's [[Porsche]] in Los Angeles. At around the same time, actress and friend [[Demi Moore]] told Sixx he needed [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], though Sixx dismissed her concerns.<ref name=\"sentinel\" /> Sixx badly injured his shoulder in the crash and was prescribed [[Percocet]], a combination of [[acetaminophen]] and the powerful opioid [[oxycodone]] which was commonly prescribed to treat severe short-term pain. Sixx's use of Percocet transitioned directly to a crippling addiction to [[heroin]] which would cost him $3,500 a day and almost claim his life later in the decade.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nAnother car crash the following year would nearly end M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The band had just wrapped up several months of touring in support of ''Shout at the Devil'' when vocalist Vince Neil threw a massive party at his [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] home, attended by the band [[Hanoi Rocks]]. After days of drinking and drugs, Neil borrowed his neighbor's 1972 [[Ford Pantera]], and he and Hanoi Rocks' drummer [[Razzle (musician)|Razzle]] made a trip to a nearby liquor store to buy more beer. Though they made it to the liquor store without incident, on the return trip the car slipped on a wet spot on the road. Neil lost control of the sportscar and veered into oncoming traffic at 65MPH, colliding with another vehicle heading in the opposite direction. The impact left the driver of the other car in a month-long coma, and her passenger was also seriously injured. Though Neil escaped without injury, his passenger wasn't so fortunate. Razzle was pronounced dead at the scene at the age of 24. Neil was subsequently charged with drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter, and the band's future was very much in doubt as Neil faced possible prison time. In the end, Neil was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, paid $2.6 million in restitution to Razzle's family, and served only 30 days in jail.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nThe song \"Bastard\" was targeted by [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]], who were behind the move to have warning labels placed on albums with lyrics or other content they found disturbing. According to guitarist [[Mick Mars]], the song wasn't a call to violence but rather was about \"a certain person that we used to work with that we felt we were stabbed in the back by.\"<ref name=\"georgiastraight\">{{cite web |url=https://earofnewt.com/2015/11/11/motley-crues-mick-mars-in-1985-without-groupies-i-probably-wouldnt-have-been-a-musician/ |last1 = Newton | first1 = Steve  |title=Motley Crue\u2019s Mick Mars: \"Without groupies, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been a musician.\" |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]] |accessdate=August 2, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n\"Knock 'Em Dead, Kid\" was inspired by a violent encounter between Sixx and a group of [[Hells Angels]]. Sixx somehow or another wound up in a fight with a group of bikers, even hitting one member in the face with a chain he had been wearing as a belt. The Hells Angels turned out to be undercover [[Police#Detectives|cops]], and the bassist was subsequently badly beaten and jailed, resulting in a black eye and broken cheekbone. After being released from jail, he was inspired to write a song about the ordeal.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[The Beatles]]' 1968 song \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", a song that allegedly inspired mass murderer [[Charles Manson]]. Sixx was not a Beatles' fan, referring to the band as \"fucking wimpy\", but he  lists \"Helter Skelter\" and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' among his favorites of all time.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/05/psychic-gruel-and-motley-crue-rocks-backpages |last1 = Kordosh | first1 = J.  |title=Psychic Gruel and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce - a classic interview from the vaults |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=August 4, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Barry|title=M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce - Shout at the Devil review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shout-at-the-devil-mw0000190978|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] | work =[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}</ref>\n| rev2 =''[[Martin Popoff|Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal]]''\n| rev2Score = 8/10<ref name=\"martin\" >{{cite book | last1 = Popoff | first1 = Martin | authorlink1 = Martin Popoff | title = The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal: Volume 2: The Eighties | publisher = [[Collector's Guide Publishing]] | date = November 1, 2005 | location = [[Burlington, Ontario]], [[Canada]] | isbn = 978-1-894959-31-5 | page= 232}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev3Score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Considine\">{{cite journal|last=Considine|first=J.

The singles \"[[Looks That Kill]]\" and \"[[Too Young to Fall in Love]]\" were moderate hits for the band.\n\n==Overview==\n''Shout at the Devil'' was M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's breakthrough success, selling 200,000 copies in its first two weeks.<ref name=\"sentinel\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/festivals/37-outrageous-stories-about-mtley-cre-b99296502z1-265704851.html |last1 = Levy | first1 = Piet  |title=37 outrageous stories about M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce |publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |accessdate=August 4, 2019 }}</ref>  The album's title and the band's use of a [[Pentagram#Satanism|Pentagram]] caused a great deal of controversy upon its 1983 release, as [[Christianity|Christian]] and conservative groups claimed the band was encouraging their listeners to worship [[Satan]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Jarriel|title=The Devil Worshippers|work=20/20|date=May 16, 1985}}</ref> The Pentagram was something [[Nikki Sixx]] brought with him from [[Sister (band)|Sister]], a very theatrical band he had been a member of (along with future [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] vocalist [[Blackie Lawless]]) in the late 70s prior to the formation of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Sister were the first L.A. band to fuse [[Occult|occult symbolism]] such as the Pentagram into a theatrical heavy metal show incorporating blood and facial [[makeup]]. Sixx asked Lawless for permission to use some of Sister's occult-related imagery for ''Shout at the Devil'', as at that point Lawless was intent on moving in a different direction. \"I said 'take whatever you want' because at that point, I realised that with an image like that, you end up painting yourself in a corner and you can't get out,\" said Lawless.<ref name=\"wasp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.waspnation.com/bitsandbobs.html |title=Facts & Rumours |publisher=waspnation.com |accessdate=August 4, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nJust prior to returning home to Los Angeles to begin recording the album, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was famously kicked off their support spot on [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' tour. The bands played only five shows together before [[Gene Simmons]] demanded they be replaced, citing their \"bad behavior\".<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nDuring recording, bassist Sixx was involved in a serious car crash after drunkenly stealing a friend's [[Porsche]] in Los Angeles. At around the same time, actress and friend [[Demi Moore]] told Sixx he needed [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], though Sixx dismissed her concerns.<ref name=\"sentinel\" /> Sixx badly injured his shoulder in the crash and was prescribed [[Percocet]], a combination of [[acetaminophen]] and the powerful opioid [[oxycodone]] which was commonly prescribed to treat severe short-term pain. Sixx's use of Percocet transitioned directly to a crippling addiction to [[heroin]] which would cost him $3,500 a day and almost claim his life later in the decade.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nAnother car crash the following year would nearly end M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The band had just wrapped up several months of touring in support of ''Shout at the Devil'' when vocalist Vince Neil threw a massive party at his [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] home, attended by the band [[Hanoi Rocks]]. After days of drinking and drugs, Neil borrowed his neighbor's 1972 [[Ford Pantera]], and he and Hanoi Rocks' drummer [[Razzle (musician)|Razzle]] made a trip to a nearby liquor store to buy more beer. Though they made it to the liquor store without incident, on the return trip the car slipped on a wet spot on the road. Neil lost control of the sportscar and veered into oncoming traffic at 65MPH, colliding with another vehicle heading in the opposite direction. The impact left the driver of the other car in a month-long coma, and her passenger was also seriously injured. Though Neil escaped without injury, his passenger wasn't so fortunate. Razzle was pronounced dead at the scene at the age of 24. Neil was subsequently charged with drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter, and the band's future was very much in doubt as Neil faced possible prison time. In the end, Neil was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, paid $2.6 million in restitution to Razzle's family, and served only 30 days in jail.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nThe song \"Bastard\" was targeted by [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]], who were behind the move to have warning labels placed on albums with lyrics or other content they found disturbing. According to guitarist [[Mick Mars]], the song wasn't a call to violence but rather was about \"a certain person that we used to work with that we felt we were stabbed in the back by.\"<ref name=\"georgiastraight\">{{cite web |url=https://earofnewt.com/2015/11/11/motley-crues-mick-mars-in-1985-without-groupies-i-probably-wouldnt-have-been-a-musician/ |last1 = Newton | first1 = Steve  |title=Motley Crue\u2019s Mick Mars: \"Without groupies, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been a musician.\" |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]] |accessdate=August 2, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n\"Knock 'Em Dead, Kid\" was inspired by a violent encounter between Sixx and a group of [[Hells Angels]]. Sixx somehow or another wound up in a fight with a group of bikers, even hitting one member in the face with a chain he had been wearing as a belt. The Hells Angels turned out to be undercover [[Police#Detectives|cops]], and the bassist was subsequently badly beaten and jailed, resulting in a black eye and broken cheekbone. After being released from jail, he was inspired to write a song about the ordeal.<ref name=\"sentinel\" />\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[The Beatles]]' 1968 song \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", a song that allegedly inspired mass murderer [[Charles Manson]].

The Senecas have also sporadically broadcast the awards ceremonies on their owned-and-operated station, [[WGWE]].\n\n== Lifetime Achievement Awards and Hall of Fame inductions ==\nAnother feature of the Native American Music Awards is the Lifetime Achievement Awards and Hall of Fame inductions:<ref name=\"NAMA\"/><ref name=\"HOF\">[http://nativeamericanmusicawards.com/halloffame.cfm Native American Music Awards - Hall of Fame]</ref>\n\n=== Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame inductions ===\n[[File:VPStar1.jpg|thumb|[[Felipe Rose]], wearing a [[War bonnet|feathered headdress]] was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 2008]]\n* [[Jimi Hendrix]] (self-identified [[Cherokee descent]]), 1998\n* [[Buddy Red Bow]] ([[Oglala Lakota]]),1998\n* [[Hank Williams]] ([[English descent]]), 1999\n* [[Jim Pepper]] ([[Kaw people|Kaw]]/[[Muscogee Creek]]), 2000\n* [[Crystal Gayle]] (self-identified [[Cherokee descent]]), 2001\n* [[Kitty Wells]], 2002\n* [[Doc Tate Nevaquaya]] ([[Comanche Nation]]), 2006\n* [[Link Wray]] (self-identified [[Shawnee]] descent), 2007\n* [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]] ([[Yaqui]]/[[Shoshone]] descent), 2008\n* [[Rickey Medlocke]] of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]/[[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], 2008\n* [[Janice-Marie Johnson]] ([[Stockbridge-Munsee]] descent) of [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]], 2008\n* [[Felipe Rose]] of [[Village People]] ([[Lakota people|Lakota]] descent), 2008\n* [[Ritchie Valens]] ([[Yaqui]]), 2009\n* [[Nokie Edwards]] ([[Cherokee]]), 2011\n* [[Keith Secola]] ([[Ojibwe]]), 2011\n* [[Russell Means]] ([[Oglala Lakota]]), 2013\n* [[Taboo]] ([[Shoshone]]), 2016\n* [[Mickie James]] ([[Powhatan]]), 2017\n* [[Jesse Ed Davis]] ([[Kiowa, Comanche]]), 2018\n* [[Wes Studi]] ([[Cherokee]]), 2019\n\n=== Lifetime Achievement Awards ===\n* [[Robbie Robertson]] ([[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]), 1998\n* [[Rita Coolidge]] (self-identified [[Cherokee descent]]), 1999\n* [[Tom Bee]] of [[XIT (band)|XIT]] ([[Dakota people|Dakota]] descent), 2000\n* [[R.

She has a pet cat named Doom Kitty, and was described as \"The Happiest Girl in the World.\" Ruby was originally marketed to the [[goth subculture]], but was later adapted for kids. The product line had an interactive website where users could chat in a forum, and click around for free things such as desktop icons and screensavers.

There isn't a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can't turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode \"Sunny Daze\", when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]].\n\n===Doom Kitty===\nAs Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with [[violin]] noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks.\n\n===Iris===\nLike Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn't a single thing this [[cyclops]] girl won't try at least once, as long as she thinks it's fun. Unfortunately, Iris's adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn't expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she's off again on another adventure. Voiced by [[Stacey DePass]].\n\n===Misery===\nMisery doesn't mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but alas they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She is pretty much beloved by many fans due to her comic relief and cute appearance. Misery is voiced by [[Emily Hampshire]].\n\n===Skull Boy===\nA man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion's official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can't seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn't know where he's going, it's mostly because he doesn't know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode \"Quadro-Gloomia\" when Frank and Len get inside Ruby's head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. He does share the same feelings towards Ruby, but he is clueless about her feelings.  Even though Skull Boy doesn't know where he is from, he has a family \u2013 his friends are his family. Voiced by [[Peter Fonda]].\n\nIn Skull Boy's endeavor to discover his roots, he has undergone many personae and occupations. These include:\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* Action Hero\n* Animator\n* Architect\n* Army General\n* Astronomer\n* British Drummer\n* British General\n* Chef\n* Detective (Skull Spade)\n* Documentary Filmmaker\n* Etiquette Expert\n* Explorer\n* Film Director (seen in the bloopers of \"Doom With A View\" and behind the scenes of \"Seeing Eye To Eyes\")\n* French Investigator\n* Head Shrink\n* Ice Sculpture\n* Inventor\n* Jazz Musician\n* Layabout\n* Magician\n* Malt Shop Entrepreneur\n* Mechanic\n* Painter\n* Pilot\n* Psychologist\n* Ringmaster\n* R.I.P's band manager\n* Scientist\n* Shakespearean Actor\n* Sculptor\n* Tailor\n* Train Conductor\n* Train Engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Frank and Len===\nRockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion's garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced \"RIP\"). Frank and Len's strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn't their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn't have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len's lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don't exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they're conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode \"Iris Springs Eternal\" where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, \"Len, if we don't get out of this I just want you to know that you've been the best brother a brother could have for a brother.\" Len replies with \"same here.\" Also, as of the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby's crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by [[David Berni]] (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len).\n\n===Edgar, Allan, and Poe===\nPoe the crow, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe's bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion's residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he'd rather tell people he's performing in an actual opera than admit that he's staying home to listen to opera records. Poe's pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe's cultured accent is an affectation. In episode \"Unsung Hero\", Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe's Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe's discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode \"Time Flies\". Poe is voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n\n===Scaredy Bat===\nScaredy Bat is a [[bat]] with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he's afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He's also afraid of his own reflection. However, he has overcome those fears after several episodes. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion's ghost, since Scaredy is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he's not afraid of is a [[crumpet]]. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len's band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating [[mosquito]]es. Voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]].\n\n===Boo Boo===\nThe mansion's [[ghost]], Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it's a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he's cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode \"Doom with a View\", (Boo Boo's first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him.  When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn't an official ghost in that he couldn't pass through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby's cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn't become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby's mansion was the house they'd selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn't go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her \"great-great-really-great-grandmother.\" However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now pass through walls and everyone can see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn't been able to scare anyone else since, besides people from outside of Gloomsville. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring, much to Mr. White's disappointment. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat seem to be good friends (perhaps ''best friends''). Doom Kitty hates Boo Boo, especially since she was framed in \"Doom with a View\", and his presence always gets her into trouble. Voiced by [[Barbara Mamabolo]].\n\n===Mr. Buns===\nMr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks. When Misery first sees him, she calls him a stuffed sock. Later, she is convinced that he is a \"special one of a kind friend\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Mr. White and Mr. White===\nThese two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within \"The Family\", they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line \"Less Taunt. More Haunt.\" Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport. The characters are voiced by [[Harvey Atkin]] and [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n\n===Squig===\nA large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can't.\n\n===Venus===\nAnother of Iris's many pets, Venus is a [[venus flytrap]]. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode \"Science Fair or Foul\", she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit \"Suspense Writing with...?\". Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man. However, Skull Boy's French accent is stronger, leading her to confusion.\n\n===Mr. Mummbles===\nRuby's next door neighbour, Mr. Mummbles<ref>Ruby Gloom Skit: \"The Mr. Mummbles How-to Show\"</ref> lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode \"Poe-Ranoia\", where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule \"Safety First\", however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks. Mr. Mummbles is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]].\n\n===The Skele-Tunes===\nA group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as \"SB\"). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, earrings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be \"Jokers\", disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as \"You're straight from the fridge daddio\" and throwing in skeleton puns like \"You fracture me\" instead of \"You crack me up\". When Skull Boy leaves to try to find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness. Skele-T is voiced by Michael Dunston.\n\n===Misery's cousins and ancestors===\nIn the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\" introduces Misery's other relatives throughout the ages for their \"once in a millennium\" family reunion.\n\n'''Malady and Malaise'''\nThese two sisters are Misery's cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that led to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from [[narcolepsy]] and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins.\n\n'''Mayhem''' \u2013 A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they're gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\", shouting \"Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy\". She is also seen in the episode, \"Time Flies\".\n\n'''Mildew''' \u2013 A Japanese [[geisha]] that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin. She also seems to constantly clarify whenever she is joking or not, as she once said: \"Misery, I've heard so much about you. All bad. Joke.\"\n\n'''Migraine''' \u2013 Arriving on the ''[[Titanic]]'', Migraine usually has her arms back yelling \"I'm the queen of the world\". She also talks like a [[valley girl]] and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes \"Time Flies\" and \"Disaster Becomes You\".\n\n'''Morose''' \u2013 Truly [[goth subculture|goth]], Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose's only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said \"cool... another verse?\". Misery calls her \"Aunt Morose\" in the episode \"Sunny Daze\".\n\n'''Mopey''' \u2013 The [[optimistic]] member of Misery's family, she has hair just like Ruby's, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says \"Right back atcha!\".\n\n'''Motley''' \u2013 Misery's great great ''really'' great grandmother. Burnt in the [[Great Fire of London]], Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire. Unlike Misery, she prefers light in the darkness. A piece of her table cloth was the only thing salvaged from the fire, and became Misery's prized possession.\n\n'''Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten''' \u2013 The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail \"Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!\"\n\nIn addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid's outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode \"Disaster Becomes You\"), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein's bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle.\n\nThe end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery's imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.).\n\n===Bunny===\nA pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby's mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty traps him in a cage and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out.\n\n===Gunther and Uta===\nTwo twins with a [[German accent]] who came to live in the Gloom household, after their run-in with a [[witch]] and her [[gingerbread house]]. They thought Ruby and her friends were about to get rid of them despite knowing that what Ruby and her friends do delights everyone else.\n\n==Episodes==\nThese are the episodes that have aired on television. Most of the episodes contain a short skit at the beginning and end of the episodes, \"Gloomer Rumor\", the first episode of the series, is the only episode to have no opening skit, but an ending skit.\n\n===Season 1 (2006\u201307)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=000\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n|

There isn't a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can't turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode \"Sunny Daze\", when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]].\n\n===Doom Kitty===\nAs Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with [[violin]] noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks.\n\n===Iris===\nLike Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn't a single thing this [[cyclops]] girl won't try at least once, as long as she thinks it's fun. Unfortunately, Iris's adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn't expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she's off again on another adventure. Voiced by [[Stacey DePass]].\n\n===Misery===\nMisery doesn't mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but alas they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She is pretty much beloved by many fans due to her comic relief and cute appearance. Misery is voiced by [[Emily Hampshire]].\n\n===Skull Boy===\nA man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion's official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can't seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn't know where he's going, it's mostly because he doesn't know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode \"Quadro-Gloomia\" when Frank and Len get inside Ruby's head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. He does share the same feelings towards Ruby, but he is clueless about her feelings.  Even though Skull Boy doesn't know where he is from, he has a family \u2013 his friends are his family. Voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n\nIn Skull Boy's endeavor to discover his roots, he has undergone many personae and occupations. These include:\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* Action Hero\n* Animator\n* Architect\n* Army General\n* Astronomer\n* British Drummer\n* British General\n* Chef\n* Detective (Skull Spade)\n* Documentary Filmmaker\n* Etiquette Expert\n* Explorer\n* Film Director (seen in the bloopers of \"Doom With A View\" and behind the scenes of \"Seeing Eye To Eyes\")\n* French Investigator\n* Head Shrink\n* Ice Sculpture\n* Inventor\n* Jazz Musician\n* Layabout\n* Magician\n* Malt Shop Entrepreneur\n* Mechanic\n* Painter\n* Pilot\n* Psychologist\n* Ringmaster\n* R.I.P's band manager\n* Scientist\n* Shakespearean Actor\n* Sculptor\n* Tailor\n* Train Conductor\n* Train Engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Frank and Len===\nRockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion's garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced \"RIP\"). Frank and Len's strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn't their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn't have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len's lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don't exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they're conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode \"Iris Springs Eternal\" where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, \"Len, if we don't get out of this I just want you to know that you've been the best brother a brother could have for a brother.\" Len replies with \"same here.\" Also, as of the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby's crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by [[David Berni]] (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len).\n\n===Edgar, Allan, and Poe===\nPoe the crow, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe's bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion's residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he'd rather tell people he's performing in an actual opera than admit that he's staying home to listen to opera records. Poe's pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe's cultured accent is an affectation. In episode \"Unsung Hero\", Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe's Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe's discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode \"Time Flies\". Poe is voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n\n===Scaredy Bat===\nScaredy Bat is a [[bat]] with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he's afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He's also afraid of his own reflection. However, he has overcome those fears after several episodes. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion's ghost, since Scaredy is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he's not afraid of is a [[crumpet]]. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len's band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating [[mosquito]]es. Voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]].\n\n===Boo Boo===\nThe mansion's [[ghost]], Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it's a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he's cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode \"Doom with a View\", (Boo Boo's first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him.  When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn't an official ghost in that he couldn't pass through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby's cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn't become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby's mansion was the house they'd selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn't go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her \"great-great-really-great-grandmother.\" However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now pass through walls and everyone can see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn't been able to scare anyone else since, besides people from outside of Gloomsville. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring, much to Mr. White's disappointment. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat seem to be good friends (perhaps ''best friends''). Doom Kitty hates Boo Boo, especially since she was framed in \"Doom with a View\", and his presence always gets her into trouble. Voiced by [[Barbara Mamabolo]].\n\n===Mr. Buns===\nMr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks. When Misery first sees him, she calls him a stuffed sock. Later, she is convinced that he is a \"special one of a kind friend\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Mr. White and Mr. White===\nThese two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within \"The Family\", they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line \"Less Taunt. More Haunt.\" Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport. The characters are voiced by [[Harvey Atkin]] and [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n\n===Squig===\nA large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can't.\n\n===Venus===\nAnother of Iris's many pets, Venus is a [[venus flytrap]]. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode \"Science Fair or Foul\", she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit \"Suspense Writing with...?\". Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man. However, Skull Boy's French accent is stronger, leading her to confusion.\n\n===Mr. Mummbles===\nRuby's next door neighbour, Mr. Mummbles<ref>Ruby Gloom Skit: \"The Mr. Mummbles How-to Show\"</ref> lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode \"Poe-Ranoia\", where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule \"Safety First\", however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks. Mr. Mummbles is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]].\n\n===The Skele-Tunes===\nA group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as \"SB\"). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, earrings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be \"Jokers\", disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as \"You're straight from the fridge daddio\" and throwing in skeleton puns like \"You fracture me\" instead of \"You crack me up\". When Skull Boy leaves to try to find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness. Skele-T is voiced by Michael Dunston.\n\n===Misery's cousins and ancestors===\nIn the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\" introduces Misery's other relatives throughout the ages for their \"once in a millennium\" family reunion.\n\n'''Malady and Malaise'''\nThese two sisters are Misery's cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that led to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from [[narcolepsy]] and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins.\n\n'''Mayhem''' \u2013 A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they're gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\", shouting \"Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy\". She is also seen in the episode, \"Time Flies\".\n\n'''Mildew''' \u2013 A Japanese [[geisha]] that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin. She also seems to constantly clarify whenever she is joking or not, as she once said: \"Misery, I've heard so much about you. All bad. Joke.\"\n\n'''Migraine''' \u2013 Arriving on the ''[[Titanic]]'', Migraine usually has her arms back yelling \"I'm the queen of the world\". She also talks like a [[valley girl]] and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes \"Time Flies\" and \"Disaster Becomes You\".\n\n'''Morose''' \u2013 Truly [[goth subculture|goth]], Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose's only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said \"cool... another verse?\". Misery calls her \"Aunt Morose\" in the episode \"Sunny Daze\".\n\n'''Mopey''' \u2013 The [[optimistic]] member of Misery's family, she has hair just like Ruby's, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says \"Right back atcha!\".\n\n'''Motley''' \u2013 Misery's great great ''really'' great grandmother. Burnt in the [[Great Fire of London]], Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire. Unlike Misery, she prefers light in the darkness. A piece of her table cloth was the only thing salvaged from the fire, and became Misery's prized possession.\n\n'''Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten''' \u2013 The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail \"Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!\"\n\nIn addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid's outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode \"Disaster Becomes You\"), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein's bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle.\n\nThe end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery's imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.).\n\n===Bunny===\nA pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby's mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty traps him in a cage and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out.\n\n===Gunther and Uta===\nTwo twins with a [[German accent]] who came to live in the Gloom household, after their run-in with a [[witch]] and her [[gingerbread house]]. They thought Ruby and her friends were about to get rid of them despite knowing that what Ruby and her friends do delights everyone else.\n\n==Episodes==\nThese are the episodes that have aired on television. Most of the episodes contain a short skit at the beginning and end of the episodes, \"Gloomer Rumor\", the first episode of the series, is the only episode to have no opening skit, but an ending skit.\n\n===Season 1 (2006\u201307)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=000\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n|
