It is closely related to [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]].\n\nNative speakers refer to the language as '''''Cabalianon''''' or '''''Kinabalianon'''''. This language shares certain characteristics with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Boholano language|Boholano]], and [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]] mainly because of the seafaring livelihood of pre-Hispanic inhabitants of Cabalian, documented by Spanish explorers.

However, Kabalian is not mutually intelligible with either Waray-Waray, Boholano, Cebuano or Surigaonon.

Fellows are selected by a panel of Senior Fellows, a group of five internationally selected senior [[classicists]].  Fellows are typically pre-tenured PhDs from around the world, most often from [[Europe]] or North America.  The \"Center\", as it is commonly called, has been a stopping point in the careers of many budding classicists who have gone on to be major contributors in the field.\n\n==Director of the Center==\nThe Director of the Center is appointed by Harvard University.  [[Michael C.J. Putnam]] ([[Brown University]], 1962) was the first director, but acted as a substitute for [[Bernard Knox]] ([[Yale University]], 1963\u20131985), the Center's first official Director.  Knox was succeeded by Zeph Stewart ([[Harvard University]], 1985\u20131992), and Stewart by Co-Directors, [[Kurt Raaflaub]] and Deborah Boedeker ([[Brown University]], 1992\u20132000).<ref name=\"Origins\">Lindquist, Eric N. \"The Origins of the Center for Hellenic Studies.\" Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-691-03174-6}}</ref>  The current Director of the Center is [[Gregory Nagy]] ([[Harvard University]], 2000\u2013present).\n\n==Campus==\nThe main building of the Center houses one of the world's premier research libraries for the study of the classical world. The library is primarily used by residential and visiting fellows, as well as visiting scholars, but it is also open to the public.  It includes a rare book room with editions from as early as the 1600s.  The main building also houses offices for the fellows,  staff, and administration.\n\nThe wooded campus has a large [[mansion]] as the director's residence, a \"stoa\" with five apartments for the fellows without families, three [[cottage]]s for the fellows with families, two subdivided cottages serving as double residences, five guest-rooms to accommodate visiting scholars, and one cottage that has been transformed into a multi-media conference facility.<ref name=\"Convergeo, Digital Agora\">{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/agora.html|title=Convergeo - Harvard Hellenic Center|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>  There is easy access from the Center to Rock Creek Park.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Center was established in 1961 through an endowment, \"exclusively for the establishment of an educational center in the field of [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic Studies]] designed to rediscover the humanism of the Hellenic Greeks,\" made by the [[Old Dominion Foundation]], (the predecessor to the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]).  The governing body was the \"Trustees of Harvard University\" (one of [[Harvard University]]'s two governing boards, now known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College or Harvard Corporation).  The Center was completed in 1963 by the architect [[H. Page Cross]] on land donated by Marie Beale in memory of her son, Walker Blaine Beale (Harvard College class of 1918) who died in [[World War I]].  In 1996, the [[Italian Embassy in Washington|Italian Embassy]] bought about half of the land from the Center and built a new facility there.  In the mid-1990s, under the directorship of Raaflaub and Boedecker, the Center was greatly expanded (from 8 Junior Fellows to 12, and with a significant renovation of the library).\n\nStarting in 2000, the current Director, [[Gregory Nagy]], has brought a new focus on outreach (both national and international), information technology, publishing, and collaborative research to the Center for Hellenic Studies, as evidenced by the Center's dynamic website.

It is affiliated with [[Harvard University]].\n\nNestled in [[Rock Creek Park]] behind [[Embassy Row]], the Center for Hellenic Studies offers a variety of both residential and remote fellowships each year to scholars and researchers working on projects in a variety of fields, including \"archaeology, [[art history]], [[epigraphy]], history, literary criticism, philology, philosophy, pedagogical applications, reception, and interdisciplinary studies\".<ref name=\"CHS Fellowships\">{{cite web|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=Fellowships&bdc=12&mn=0|title=Opportunities for Researchers: CHS Fellowships in Hellenic Studies |website=CHS |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>  The Center provides housing for \"residential\" fellows and their families, and accommodates remote fellows and visiting scholars during shorter stays.  Fellows are selected by a panel of Senior Fellows, a group of five internationally selected senior [[classicists]].  Fellows are typically pre-tenured PhDs from around the world, most often from [[Europe]] or North America.  The \"Center\", as it is commonly called, has been a stopping point in the careers of many budding classicists who have gone on to be major contributors in the field.\n\n==Director of the Center==\nThe Director of the Center is appointed by Harvard University.  [[Michael C.J. Putnam]] ([[Brown University]], 1962) was the first director, but acted as a substitute for [[Bernard Knox]] ([[Yale University]], 1963\u20131985), the Center's first official Director.  Knox was succeeded by Zeph Stewart ([[Harvard University]], 1985\u20131992), and Stewart by Co-Directors, [[Kurt Raaflaub]] and Deborah Boedeker ([[Brown University]], 1992\u20132000).<ref name=\"Origins\">Lindquist, Eric N. \"The Origins of the Center for Hellenic Studies.\" Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-691-03174-6}}</ref>  The current Director of the Center is [[Gregory Nagy]] ([[Harvard University]], 2000\u2013present).\n\n==Campus==\nThe main building of the Center houses one of the world's premier research libraries for the study of the classical world. The library is primarily used by residential and visiting fellows, as well as visiting scholars, but it is also open to the public.  It includes a rare book room with editions from as early as the 1600s.  The main building also houses offices for the fellows,  staff, and administration.\n\nThe wooded campus has a large [[mansion]] as the director's residence, a \"stoa\" with five apartments for the fellows without families, three [[cottage]]s for the fellows with families, two subdivided cottages serving as double residences, five guest-rooms to accommodate visiting scholars, and one cottage that has been transformed into a multi-media conference facility.<ref name=\"Convergeo, Digital Agora\">{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/agora.html|title=Convergeo - Harvard Hellenic Center|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>  There is easy access from the Center to Rock Creek Park.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Center was established in 1961 through an endowment, \"exclusively for the establishment of an educational center in the field of [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic Studies]] designed to rediscover the humanism of the Hellenic Greeks,\" made by the [[Old Dominion Foundation]], (the predecessor to the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]).  The governing body was the \"Trustees of Harvard University\" (one of [[Harvard University]]'s two governing boards, now known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College or Harvard Corporation).  The Center was completed in 1963 by the architect [[H. Page Cross]] on land donated by Marie Beale in memory of her son, Walker Blaine Beale (Harvard College class of 1918) who died in [[World War I]].  In 1996, the [[Italian Embassy in Washington|Italian Embassy]] bought about half of the land from the Center and built a new facility there.
