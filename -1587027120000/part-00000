Siddhi and Vinayak grew up together but a misunderstanding causes them to separate and they meet 14 years later. When Siddhi realises Vin is Vinayak, she lashes out at him for causing the accident that left her father paralysed back when they were kids. As Vin tries to apologise to Siddhi, they are attacked and Vin watches helplessly as Siddhi is caught in a fire. Vin thinks Siddhi was killed by his father Shankar. \n\n=== 1 year later ===\nSiddhi is forced to undergo a plastic surgery and with help from Dr. Pratima assumes the look and identity of Riddhi ([[Farnaz Shetty]]), her dead granddaughter. She gets a job as Vinayak's secretary to take revenge from him thinking he was responsible for the attack on her. In her absence, Vin has become distant from his father and has been taking care of Siddhi's family disguised as an NGO worker called Prateek. Siddhi's family have still been waiting for her. \n\nRiddhi gradually discovers that Vin has been innocent all along. Meanwhile, Vin's cousin Rajbeer and his wife Prachi (who is also Siddhi's sister) make several plans to kill Vin as does Vin's other brother Manbeer's wife, Gauri. Discovering his innocence, Riddhi saves Vin risking her own life and realises she has fallen in love. She also finds out that while Shankar had paid goons to kidnap Siddhi, someone else had set her on fire and attacked Vin. Vin's family's priest, Guru ji, warns them that his life is in danger and can be saved only if he is married to a woman who will protect him at all costs. Vin's mother Manjari convinces him to agree and his wedding is fixed to a woman named Vaibhavi. However, Riddhi exposes Vaibhavi and her mother Kanta to be frauds. Vin meets with an accident and to save him Riddhi marries him while he is unconscious with only Shankar, Manjari, Manbeer and Guru ji knowing about the wedding. Manjari is revealed to have been behind all the attacks on Vin and shown to be doing it to control the Kundra property. Vin falls in love with Riddhi not knowing she is Siddhi and is already married to him. \n\nShivam Sen comes to Kundra Mansion and convinces everyone that Siddhi is his wife Riddhi and mother of Juhi. Manjari supports Shivam. Vin finally finds out Riddhi is in fact his wife and is Siddhi. He tries to get her back but Siddhi is attacked. Manjari kidnaps Juhi and makes it look like Shivam is responsible. Vin comes to save Manjari and Juhi, but Manjari shoots Shivam and kills him. When police arrive, Vin takes the blame and goes to jail. Siddhi figures out Manjari is the murderer and is trying to kill her. Manjari sends a man named Kabir to kill Vin while he is in jail but Vin is able to escape. Siddhi eventually proves Vin's innocence in court and brings him home. \n\nWhile everyone in the Kundra family celebrate Vin's return, a man named Rudra enters the Kundra Mansion stating he is the long lost son of Shankar and Manjari. It is finally revealed that Shankar gave up Rudra after he was born to protect Vin as per a prophecy and that Manjari had been acting against Vin all along because Vin is her stepson while Rudra is her biological son. Rudra falls for Siddhi but gets married to a woman named Urvashi. At a festival, Siddhi saves Vin from being shot at by Rudra. However, someone shoots Rudra and he dies. Vin misunderstands Siddhi and marries a pregnant Urvashi.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Nitin Goswami]] as Vinayak \"Vin\" Kundra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/nitin-goswami-i-only-want-to-play-the-male-lead-now/articleshow/70644400.cms|title=Nitin Goswami: I only want to play the male lead now - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/tv/hindi/neha-saxena-and-nitin-goswami-talk-about-their-show-siddhivinayak-/videoshow/61211882.cms|title=Neha Saxena and Nitin Goswami talk about their show Siddhivinayak. {{!}} TV - Times of India Videos|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* [[Neha Saxena (TV actress)|Neha Saxena]] as Siddhi Joshi (before plastic surgery)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/in-conversation-with-neha-saxena-on-fb-watch-now/articleshow/61115586.cms|title=In conversation with Neha Saxena on FB, watch now|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=Times Of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/neha-saxena-to-make-a-comeback-with-a-fiction-show/articleshow/60956671.cms|title=Neha Saxena to make a comeback with a fiction show|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Farnaz Shetty]] as Riddhi Sen, a woman whose face is given to Siddhi; later Siddhi (after plastic surgery)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizasialive.com/farnaz-shetty-replaces-neha-saxena-lead-siddhi-vinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty replaces Neha Saxena as lead in 'Siddhi Vinayak'|last=Correspondent|first=BizAsia|date=2018-01-21|website=BizAsia {{!}} Media, Entertainment, Showbiz, Events and Music|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.easterneye.biz/farnaz-shetty-neha-saxena-siddhivinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty in, Neha Saxena out of Siddhivinayak|last=Singh|first=Mohnish|date=2018-01-22|website=EasternEye|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n* [[Roshni Rastogi]] as Urvashi Kundra, Vinayak's second wife\n* Utkarsha Naik as Manjari Kundra, Vinayak's stepmother\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shardul Pandit]] as Shivam Sen, Riddhi\u2019s husband<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/shardul-pandit-to-make-his-theatre-debut/articleshow/66766069.cms|title=Shardul Pandit to make his theatre debut - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* Ayesha Vindhara as Juhi Sen, Shivam and Riddhi's daughter\n*[[Gaurav S Bajaj]] as Rudra Kundra, Manjari's long lost son, Vinayak's half brother\n*[[Manish Khanna]] as Shankar Kundra, Vinayak and Rudra's father\n*Karan Khandelwal as Rajbeer Kundra, Vinayak's cousin brother\n*Nishi Singh as Bijlee Kundra, Rajbeer's mother\n*[[Priyanka Bora]] as Prachi Joshi, Siddhi's sister and later Rajbeer's wife\n* Prithvi Sankala as Aniket Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's father\n* Anjali Gupta as Savita Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's mother\n*Amar Deep Garg as Guru ji\n* Farah Hussain as Zai, Siddhi's friend\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n''[http://www.ozee.com/shows/siddhivinayak Siddhi Vinayak]'' Streaming on OZEE\n\n{{&TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:&TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name              = Siddhi Vinayak\n| image                  = Sidvin TV.jpg\n| caption                = \n| genre                  = [[Drama]]\n| creator                = Prashant Bhatt <br>Sanjay Memane\n| writer                 = Renu Watwani <br> Vishal Watwani <br> Salil Sand <br> Agam gaurav\n| starring               = [[Siddhi Vinayak#Cast|See below]]\n| opentheme              = \n| country                = India\n| language               = Hindi\n| num_seasons            = 2\n| num_episodes           = 320\n| producer               = Prashant Bhatt<br> Sanjay Memane\n| director                =Santosh Bhatt\n| camera                 = [[Multi-camera setup|Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                = 22 minutes \n| company                = Studio B & M\n| picture_format         = [[576i]] <br> [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])\n| first_aired            = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|10|26|}}\n| last_aired             = {{End date|df=yes|2019|1|18|}}\n| related =[[Pratidaan]]\n| channel                = [[ZEE5]]<br>[[&TV]] \n| website                = https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/siddhivinayak/0-6-677\n}}\n\n'''''Siddhi Vinayak''''' is an Indian romantic television series that aired from 26 October 2017 to 18 January 2019 on [[&TV]].

the '''Republic of Singapore''', is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[city-state]] and [[island country]] located in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore\u2014historically known by the names ''Pulau Ujong'', ''Temasek'', and subsequently ''Singapura''\u2014was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival Singapore to mark 200th anniversary of Raffles' arrival, Singapore News & Top Stories - The Straits Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]]. It is postulated that the [[Majapahit]] exercised control over Singapore at some point in its history. Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang.

Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]]. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries, solving the ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], splitting from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=T.

UMNO, who was initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the PAP government and were concerned that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended, changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists.

the '''Republic of Singapore''', is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[city-state]] and [[island country]] located in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. Singapore lies about one degree of latitude ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], and is situated off the southern tip of the [[Malay peninsula]], and, by extension, the [[Extreme points of Asia|southernmost extremity]] of continental [[Eurasia]]. The island country is wedged between western [[Indonesia]] and [[peninsular Malaysia]], sharing its [[Indonesia\u2013Singapore border|southern maritime border]] with the [[Riau archipelago]] of the former's [[Riau Islands]] province, and its [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore border|northern, western, and eastern maritime borders]] with the latter's [[Johor|Johor state]]; it is additionally in the vicinity of [[Sumatra]] to its west and [[Borneo]] to its east. The island country is enveloped by the littoral waters of the [[Straits of Johor|Johore Strait]] to its north and the [[Singapore Strait]] to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the [[Malacca Strait]] to its west and the [[South China Sea]] to its east. The country's territory, which is [[Malay Archipelago|archipelagic]], is composed of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]], the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive [[land reclamation]] projects.\n\nThroughout its millennia-long history, Singapore\u2014historically known by the names ''Pulau Ujong'', ''Temasek'', and subsequently ''Singapura''\u2014was a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] that fell under the suzerainty of several successive Malay polities: initially a series of ancient to medieval Hindu-Buddhist [[thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empires, subsequently a medieval [[Kingdom of Singapura|localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]], and ultimately two medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sultanates.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-mark-200th-anniversary-of-raffles-arrival Singapore to mark 200th anniversary of Raffles' arrival, Singapore News & Top Stories - The Straits Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{refn|Singapore fell under the ''[[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]'' (suzerainty) of at least two Hindu-Buddhist thalassocracies (maritime empires): The [[Melayu Kingdom]] (also known as Dharmasraya or Jambi), and [[Srivijaya]].

Following Srivijaya's decline, a localised Hindu-Buddhist kingdom\u2014the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]\u2014was founded on the main island. The Kingdom of Singapura was the final Dharmic polity to have exercised control of Singapore. It was then succeeded by the Muslim [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was in turn succeeded by the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014the final indigenous Malay polity to have exercised control over Singapore prior to its colonisation by the British.|group=Note}} The 1819 arrival of [[Stamford Raffles]], a British colonial officer, and the subsequent establishment of a British [[East India Company]] trading post on the main island\u2014then part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]\u2014marked the [[Founding of modern Singapore|genesis of modern Singapore]].

In 1959, following a protracted period of agitation against colonial rule, Singapore was granted limited autonomy; in 1963, it became fully emancipated from the British Empire upon its [[Malaysia Agreement|federation]] with the territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] to form the new country of [[Malaysia]].{{refn|Singapore federated with three other entities to form the country of Malaysia. <br><br> The first entity was the [[Federation of Malaya]], which was the decolonised agglomeration of the peninsular territories of the erstwhile [[British Malaya]]\u2014composed of the [[Unfederated Malay States]], the [[Federated Malay States]], and the peninsular [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung District|Dindings]]. <br><br> The second and third entities were the [[British Borneo|British Bornean]] crown colonies of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], respectively; the latter came to be known as [[Sabah]] after the formation of Malaysia.|group=Note}} However, after [[Singapore in Malaysia|two tumultuous years]] as a constituent state of the Malaysian Federation, marred by violent ethnoreligious [[Ethnic conflict|strife]] and other intractable differences between [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] and non-indigenous groups, Singapore was [[August 1965#August 9, 1965 (Monday)|expelled]] in 1965, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will\u2014although this narrative remains contentious.{{refn|Singapore's secession from the Malaysian Federation in 1965 is a contentious issue without a set historical narrative. The popular narrative is that Singapore was expelled from Malaysia, becoming the first country in modern history to gain independence against its will. This is technically correct, as the Malaysian Parliament voted unanimously in favour of Singapore's expulsion from the Federation. <br><br> However, historians believe that Singapore's political leaders might have been acutely aware of the prospect of a breakaway from the very start because of the domestic instability brought about by the incompatibility of worldviews within the Federation\u2014the most major source of acrimony being the steadfast insistence of Singapore's leaders on the concept of a [[Malaysian Malaysia]], not a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated Malaysia ''([[Ketuanan Melayu]])''. It has even been suggested that some of Singapore's political leaders might have actively precipitated the breakaway by negotiating the terms of secession in backdoor meetings.<ref>[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52146/was-singapore%E2%80%99s-independence-accident Was Singapore\u2019s Independence an Accident? | Mental Floss<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>|group=Note}} After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]], the newly sovereign nation\u2014viewed as a nonviable state by international observers due to its [[microstate|diminutiveness]], geostrategic vulnerability, absence of natural resources, and lack of a [[hinterland]]\u2014defied odds by rapidly developing and industrialising under the leadership of the inaugural [[People's Action Party]] to become a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]] and developed country within a single generation, dubbed as the \"[[Singapore Miracle]]\".\n\nSingapore is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary republic|parliamentary]] [[Constitution|constitutional]] [[republic]] with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature that has been characterised by [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party rule]] since independence.

The Annals state that Nila Utama, who discovered the island on a voyage and subsequently founded the Kingdom of Singapura, sought to give the island a regal name after witnessing a lion stalking its shores. However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; the prince probably saw a [[Malayan tiger]], the largest [[big cat]] species endemic to the Malay peninsula. The second hypothesis, drawn from the ''[[Tom\u00e9 Pires#The Suma Oriental|Suma Oriental]]'', a Portuguese historical source, postulates that the name was given by another Srivijayan Raja, the 14th-century [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] of Palembang. According to the source, Parameswara was the actual founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, usurping the throne of the preceding Temasek kingdom from its ruler, installing himself as Raja, and rechristening the kingdom ''Singapura'' in order to legitimise his claim over the island with a regal name of his own making. Although the name Parameswara and the narrative of usurpation are not mentioned in the Malay Annals, it is believed that Iskandar Shah\u2014a ruler identified by the Annals to be the fifth and final Raja of Singapura, and the subsequent founder of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]\u2014corresponds with the Parameswara of the ''Suma Oriental'' based on the extreme similarity of their biographies.<ref name=\"turnbull\" />\n\nFor several millennia prior to the adoption of ''Singapura'' as the island's name, its linguistic ancestor\u2014''Si\u1e43hapura''\u2014had an illustrious history as an ubiquitous and prestigious place name in use in Dharmic literature and across the ancient and medieval Hindu-Buddhist polities of South and Southeast Asia.

High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country [[Siamese revolution of 1932|abolished absolute monarchy in 1932]].\n\n[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the city from British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]]'s embassy in 1822]]\nAs Thailand allied with Japan [[Thailand in World War II|in World War II]], Bangkok was subjected to [[Bombing of Bangkok in World War II|Allied bombing]], but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in [[14 October 1973 uprising|1973]] and [[Thammasat University massacre|1976]], anti-military demonstrations [[Black May (1992)|in 1992]], and successive anti-government demonstrations by opposing groups from 2008 on.\n\nAdministration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of [[Monthon]] Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon ({{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23}}) as a national subdivision. In 1915 the ''monthon'' was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\n==Name==\nThe origin of the name ''Bangkok'' ({{lang|th|\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01}}, pronounced in Thai as {{IPA-th|b\u0101\u02d0\u014b k\u0254\u0300\u02d0k||Th-Bangkok.ogg}}), is unclear.

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station.

Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's [[sex tourism]] scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.\n\n[[File:Khao San Road at night by kevinpoh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Night scene on a pedestrian street, with many people and street vendors; shops along the street bearing brightly lit signs with names like &quot;99Fashion&quot;, &quot;Brick Bar&quot;, &quot;Mulligans Irish Bar&quot;, and Pepsi and McDonald&#39;s logos|[[Khao San Road]] is lined by budget accommodation, shops and bars catering to tourists.]]\nAmong Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Wat Pho]], and [[Wat Arun]]. The [[Giant Swing]] and [[Erawan Shrine]] demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. [[Vimanmek Mansion]] in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the [[Jim Thompson House]] provides an example of traditional [[Thai architecture]]. Other major museums include the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Royal Barge National Museum]]. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;63\u201369.</ref>\n\nShopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. [[Taling Chan Floating Market]] is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. [[Khao San Road]] has long been famous as a destination for [[backpacker tourism]], with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.\n\nBangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name=\"EmmonsEveland2011\">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIssues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]]. Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nualkhair|first1=Chawadee|title=Bangkok's street food under threat from gentrification|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/12/bangkok-street-food-stalls-under-threat|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2017}}</ref> While some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights, others have expressed concern that [[gentrification]] would lead to the loss of the city's character and adverse changes to people's way of life.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mokkhasen|first1=Sasiwan|title=Vanishing Bangkok: What is the Capital Being Remade Into, And For Whom?|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/bangkok/2016/07/05/reorganization/|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=Khaosod English|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sauers|first1=Craig|title=Bangkok's disappearing street food|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160817-bangkoks-disappearing-street-food|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=BBC Travel|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals and events===\n[[File:Ratchadamnoen King80 arch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An elaborate double archway above a road, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej; trees decorated with lights|[[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] is annually decorated with lights and displays in celebration of [[King Bhumibol]]'s birthday.]]\nThe residents of Bangkok celebrate many of Thailand's annual festivals. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays. ''Khon'' and other traditional dances are regularly performed at the [[National Theatre (Thailand)|National Theatre]] and [[Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre]], while the [[Thailand Cultural Centre]] is a newer multi-purpose venue which also hosts musicals, orchestras and other events. [[List of theatres in Bangkok|Numerous venues]] regularly feature a variety of performances throughout the city.\n<!-- Can't use this since it's pretty much unreferenced and not really the right tone. If someone could rework the paragraph please do so.\nThe arts in Bangkok have developed almost exclusively and anonymously in the services of Theravada Buddhism since the Ayutthaya period and continuing to the present day by incorporating Western elements which is called the [[Rattanakosin style|Rattanakosin]] or Bangkok style. Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare.

Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government.<ref name=\"BMA geo\"/> The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, [[Phahonyothin Road|Phahonyothin]] and [[Ratchawithi Road|Ratchawithi]]&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]].

During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays.

Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. [[Ramkhamhaeng University]] emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Sukanya|last=Nitungkorn |title=The problems of secondary education expansion in Thailand |journal=Southeast Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=1|date=June 1988 |url=http://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/26/1/260102.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools.

Results of such polls are displayed in this article. The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 Greek legislative election|previous legislative election]], to the present day.\n\nPolls are listed in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" columns on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll.\n\n==Voting intention estimates==\n===Graphical summary===\n[[File:OpinionPollingGreeceNextGeneralElection.png|thumb|center|900px|10-point average trend line of poll results from 7 July 2019 to the present day, with each line corresponding to a political party.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=250px|\n {{Legend-line|{{New Democracy (Greece)/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[New Democracy (Greece)|ND]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{Coalition of the Radical Left/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[Syriza]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{Panhellenic Socialist Movement/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[Movement for Change (Greece)|KINAL]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{Communist Party of Greece/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{Greek Solution/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[Greek Solution|EL]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{MeRA25/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[MeRA25]]}}\n {{Legend-line|{{Golden Dawn (Greece)/meta/color}} solid 5px|[[Golden Dawn (political party)|XA]]}}\n}}]]\n\n===Polling===\nThe table below lists nationwide voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of \"don't know\" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. Polls that show their results without disregarding those respondents who were undecided or said they would abstain from voting (either physically or by voting blank) have been re-calculated by disregarding these numbers from the totals offered through a [[WP:CALC|simple]] [[Rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]] in order to obtain results comparable to other polls and the official election results.

Results of such polls are displayed in this article. The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 Greek legislative election|previous legislative election]], to the present day.\n\nPolls are listed in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages.

Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of \"don't know\" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. Polls that show their results without disregarding those respondents who were undecided or said they would abstain from voting (either physically or by voting blank) have been re-calculated by disregarding these numbers from the totals offered through a [[WP:CALC|simple]] [[Rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]] in order to obtain results comparable to other polls and the official election results. When available, seat projections are displayed below the percentages in a smaller font. 151 seats are required for an [[absolute majority]] in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center;
