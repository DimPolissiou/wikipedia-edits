A rebellious and eccentric figure, Negoi\u0163escu began his career while still an adolescent, and made himself known as a literary ideologue of the 1940s generation. Moving from a youthful affiliation to the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he later came to regret, the author became a disciple of [[Modernist literature|modernist]] doyen [[Eugen Lovinescu]], and, by 1943, rallied the entire Sibiu Circle to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. He was also one of the few openly [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] intellectuals in Romania to have [[Coming out|come out]] before the 1990s\u2014an experience which, like his political commitments, is recorded in his controversial autobiographical writings.\n\nAfter World War II, Negoi\u0163escu's [[anti-communism]], [[dissident]] stance and sexual orientation made him an adversary of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]. Marginalized and [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censored]], he spent three years as a [[political prisoner]]. Ultimately reinstated during a late 1960s episode of [[liberalization]], he continued to speak out against political restrictions, and came to be closely monitored by the [[Securitate]] [[secret police]]. In 1977, he joined [[Paul Goma]] and [[Ion Vianu]] in a [[civil society]] protest against the rule of [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], but was pressured into retracting. Eventually, Negoi\u0163escu [[Defection|defected]] to [[West Germany]], where he became a contributor to [[Radio Free Europe]] and various other anti-communist outlets, as well as editor of literary magazines for the [[Romanian diaspora]] communities. He died in [[Munich]].\n\nIon Negoi\u0163escu's review of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] and contributions to literary theory generally stood in contrast to the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[National communism|national communist]] recourse to traditionalism or [[anti-Europeanism]], and engaged it polemically by advocating the values of [[Western culture]]. His diverse work, although scattered and largely incomplete, drew critical praise for its original takes on various subjects, and primarily for its views on the posthumously published writings of [[national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]]. In tandem, the implications of Negoi\u0163escu's private life and the various aspects of his biography, such as his relationship to exposed Securitate informant [[Petru Romo\u015fan]] and the revelations of his unpublished diary, have remained topics of controversy in the years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Negoi\u0163escu was the son of Ioan, a career officer in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], and his wife Lucre\u0163ia ''n\u00e9e'' Cotu\u0163iu.<ref name=\"asnegoit\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/STEFANESCUmai5.html \"Ion Negoi\u0163escu\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308095024/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/STEFANESCUmai5.html |date=2009-03-08 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', May 2005</ref> His maternal grandfather, a member of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] clergy in [[Transylvania]], had taken part in the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum|Memorandum]]'' movement under [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] rule.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In contrast, Negoi\u0163escu's father came from outside Transylvania, being born to parents from the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]].<ref name=\"iprataciri\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Ioana P\u00e2rvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/rtcirile_elevului_negoiescu \"R\u0103t\u0103cirile elevului Negoi\u0163escu\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226212732/http://www.romlit.ro/rtcirile_elevului_negoiescu |date=2012-02-26 }}, in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 24/2002</ref><ref name=\"srcerchistii\">{{in lang|ro}} \u015etef\u0103ni\u0163\u0103 Regman, [http://www.romlit.ro/cerchitii_nainte_de_coborrea_n_infern \"Cerchi\u015ftii \u00eenainte de cobor\u00e2rea \u00een Infern\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311232836/http://www.romlit.ro/cerchitii_nainte_de_coborrea_n_infern |date=2012-03-11 }}, in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 23/2007</ref> The future author studied at the Angelescu High School in his native city, and debuted in 1937, when he had [[lyric poetry]] fragments published in the local newspaper ''Na\u0163iunea Rom\u00e2n\u0103''.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/><ref name=\"acceptstraja\">Adrian Newell-P\u0103un, [http://accept.ong.ro/buletin29eng.html \"Book Review.

Its summary version was first published in 1968 by ''Familia'', and instantly made its author the center of attention from several milieus. Having decided not to treat his subjects in the conventional [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] manner encouraged by the authorities, he stirred polemic passions on the literary scene and became a target for surveillance by the authorities.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Negoi\u0163escu's text, which linked Romanian literary history with the development of urban culture,<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> also intrigued the cultural establishment because it seemed to leave out completely all works produced before 1800.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Also in 1968, Negoi\u0163escu moved on from ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' to ''[[Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', where he was also granted an editorial staff office (a position he kept until 1971).<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> That same year, he was allowed to travel beyond the [[Iron Curtain]], but, as he himself recalled, the communist press at home had used the occasion to call him a \"defector\", \"traitor\" and \"fascist\".<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> While in France, Negoi\u0163escu visited [[Monica Lovinescu]], who was by then noted as a literary reviewer for the [[Romanian diaspora]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] spokeswoman. Upon his return, Negoi\u0163escu admitted to Romanian officials that the object of this meeting was to reestablish the Eugen Lovinescu Award, which Monica Lovinescu had considered delegating to a panel of young critics living inside Romania (Matei C\u0103linescu, Virgil Nemoianu, [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [[Eugen Simion]], [[Mihai Ungheanu]] and [[Ileana Vrancea]]); according to his account, the Communist Party structures prevented him from even suggesting this offer to the cultural official [[Paul Niculescu-Mizil]].<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> Later, when he wanted to revisit France and honor the personal invitation of writer [[Jacques Borel]], the communist apparatus denied him a new passport.<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> In early 1969, Negoi\u0163escu, newly readmitted into the Writers' Union, was assigned an apartment on Bucharest's [[Calea Victoriei]].<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> In December of the same year, the authorities threatened to confiscate the Negoi\u0163escu's citing a juridical rationale he viewed as untenable, and, as a result, he initiated a formal gesture of protest.<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/>\n\nDespite the rising negative reactions against his work, Negoi\u0163escu continued to publish essays and [[monograph]]s: ''\u00censemn\u0103ri critice'' (\"Critical Records\", 1970), ''E.

In one incident of 1971, the entire circulation of ''Lampa lui Aladin'' was confiscated and destroyed by the regime's representatives.<ref name=\"acceptstraja\"/> Such measures caused Negoi\u0163escu distress, and led him to attempt killing himself a third time, on August 23, 1974 (the 1944 Coup's 30th anniversary, and Romania's national holiday during communism).<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/><ref name=\"acceptstraja\"/><ref name=\"mciv406-407\">C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.406-407</ref> According to his friend, psychiatrist [[Ion Vianu]], Negoi\u0163escu was hospitalized in the [[Bucharest Emergency Hospital]] for a long period, after having swallowed a large quantity of [[hypnotic]]s.<ref name=\"mciv406-407\"/> In parallel with these events in his life and career, he published several works of poetry: ''Sabasios'' (1968), ''Poemele lui Balduin de Tyaormin'' (\"Poems by Baldwin of Tyaormin\", 1969), ''Moartea unui contabil'' (\"Death of an Accountant\", 1972), ''Via\u0163a particular\u0103'' (\"Private Life\", 1977).<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/>\n\n===Goma movement and defection===\nA seminal event in the writer's life and career occurred in 1977, when he openly rallied with [[dissident]] politics.

Literary historian [[Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu]] compares the overall effect to \"a room searched by the Securitate and left a mess.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Noting the same defining characteristic of incompleteness, literary critic [[Bogdan Cre\u0163u]] mentions Negoi\u0163escu's inconsistency as an alternative cause: \"he was a man of great projects which, as a rule, he did not manage to complete.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Despite finding fault in this tendency, Cre\u0163u rates the author as \"the most talented\" among the Sibiu Circle critics, and \"one of the most gifted critics we have ever had.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> The value of his contribution was linked by various commentators with Negoi\u0163escu's approach to literature and, in particular, his personal appreciation of beauty. Such distinctive traits were first discussed by Lovinescu in his 1943 article. Comparing Negoi\u0163escu to both Eminescu and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], the ''Sbur\u0103torul'' theorist insisted on discussing his young disciple's appearance as an exterior sign of literary finesse: \"A fine, feminine, [[Androgyny|androgynous]]; delicacy, shyness, quickly alarmed by some sort of bashfulness betrayed by discreet shades of [[carmine]]. And over all this appearance, a mask of reverie\".<ref name=\"srcerchistii\"/> Cre\u0163u sees Negoi\u0163escu's career as being consumed by \"[[Romanticism|romantic]] gestures or enthusiastic drives, hardly tempered by the prodigious culture of this oversensitive, never matured, [[dandy]].\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Referring to their collaboration in the Sibiu Circle during the late 1940s, Balot\u0103 however noted that Negoi\u0163escu was an outspoken critic of those who valued beauty over message, being as such in line with the group's \"ambiguous [[aestheticism]]\".<ref>Balot\u0103, p.199-200</ref> According to Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu, Negoi\u0163escu, a \"solitary and misunderstood\" figure, approached his mission more as an \"[[Po\u00e8te maudit|accursed poet]]\" than a researcher, and found in literature \"a drug\" to \"inject in his veins\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In \u015etef\u0103nescu's view, this fundamental trait, like Negoi\u0163escu's homosexuality, was incompatible with both the \"forceful brutishness\" of communism and the \"prude\" nature of Romanian society.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/>\n\nNovelist and critic [[Norman Manea]] referred to \"the exemplary nature of [Negoi\u0163escu's] case\", as evidence that, contrary to popular opinion, the quality of one's literature \"does not arrive from the ethic to the aesthetic, but the other way around.\"<ref>Manea, p.165</ref> In his assessment, Negoi\u0163escu was \"a minority member, not just an erotic one, but a chosen person, personifying the burning conditioning, truly intrinsic, [...] between freedom and beauty, not just between liberty and morality\".<ref name=\"nm167\">Manea, p.167</ref> Similarly, [[Matei C\u0103linescu]] recalled being \"fascinated\" by \"his vigorous '[[Decadent movement|decadent]]' aestheticism which was however paradoxically doubled by a major moral intransigence in matters of art and artistic truth\".<ref name=\"mciv343\"/> He believed Negoi\u0163escu's artistic vision to feature \"a hidden moral edge\", one occasionally turning back \"on himself\", and making Negoi\u0163escu \"one of the major ethical figures in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]].\"<ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.362</ref> A similar verdict was provided by [[Ion Vianu]]: \"his proud demeanor, the rigorous aestheticism he professed were the expression of an extreme exigence, as expanded on the artistic level as it was on the moral one.\"<ref name=\"mciv406\">C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.406</ref> Such aspects prompted Bogdan Cre\u0163u to suggest that Negoi\u0163escu's work was primarily characterized by a \"critical consciousness\", made possible by his \"specific [and] tragic [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionism]]\": \"although it caused him great distress during his lifetime [...], it compelled him to become, no matter what the risks, consistent with himself; that is to say honest, enthusiastic, genuine.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\nAs negative consequences of Negoi\u0163escu's aestheticism, \u015etef\u0103nescu cites his \"excess of solemnity\" and the \"excessive shyness\" of his critical essays, as well as a lack of determination and a tendency toward \"[[autosuggestion]]\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Likewise, writer [[Andrei Terian]] saw Negoi\u0163escu as lacking a critic's \"literary head\", being instead an \"avid consumer of art\" with \"an immense sensual appetite\".<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> In reference to the issue of critic versus artist, \u015etef\u0103nescu argues: \"He would provide contradictory verdicts. He would most often allow himself to be guided by the will to experience a moment of aesthetic beatitude. Whenever he lacked literary [[heroin]], he would settle for a weak text [...]. He loved depths so much that he invented them.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> He and other commentators assess that Negoi\u0163escu's self-avowed love for literature and books as objects was almost physical in nature.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/><ref name=\"astansimturi\"/>\n\n===Early works and ''Euphorion'' ideals===\nA substantial and precocious element of Negoi\u0163escu's critical work was constituted by his focus on [[Mateiu Caragiale]]. Bogdan Cre\u0163u, who notes the enthusiastic reception Negoi\u0163escu granted to Caragiale's poetic work in his very first published essay, believes there is an intrinsic connection between the two figures at the level of aestheticism.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> According to Ion Vianu, the \"beautiful, pale and distant\" Negoi\u0163escu brought to mind Aubrey de Vere, the \"morbid aristocrat\" in Caragiale's novella ''Remember''.<ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.405-406</ref> Negoi\u0163escu's lifelong appreciation of Caragiale's work, specifically his claim that ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' novel was a masterpiece formed around a \"secret architecture\", was contested by literary critic and [[English studies|Anglicist]] [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]]. Mih\u0103ie\u015f described ''Craii...'' a sample of \"pretentious [[kitsch]]\", and accused his various colleagues of having artificially increased Caragiale's cultural rating.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]], [http://www.romlit.ro/care_e_cea_mai_proast_carte_romneasc \"Care e cea mai proast\u0103 carte rom\u00e2neasc\u0103?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903115112/http://www.romlit.ro/care_e_cea_mai_proast_carte_romneasc |date=2009-09-03 }}, in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 31/2009</ref>\n\nBy 1945, Cre\u0163u argues, Negoi\u0163escu had reached his creative maturity, primarily by perfecting the \"[[deconstruction]]\" of texts making the object of his reviews.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> In particular, Cre\u0163u sees as outstanding the young critic's verdicts on George C\u0103linescu's novel ''[[Enigma Otiliei]]'' (where Negoi\u0163escu had identified, probably ahead of all other commentators, a level of [[parody]] running underneath the formal borrowings from [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]) and on the poems of [[George Bacovia]] (compared by Negoi\u0163escu to the overall artistic standards of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist circles]], with which Bacovia had been formally affiliated).<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> Written in parallel, ''Povestea trist\u0103 a lui Ramon Ocg'', described by \u015etef\u0103nescu as marking Negoi\u0163escu's brief affiliation with [[Surrealism]],<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> romanticizes the life of Mexican film star [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]], with emphasis on Navarro's homosexuality.<ref name=\"acceptstraja\"/> In Bogdan Cre\u0163u's definition, the book shows Negoi\u0163escu's commitment to anti-fascism, and especially his use of [[satire]] against \"the fascist ideology, with all its abuses.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> Cre\u0163u also notes that the printing of ''Povestea trist\u0103...'' was financed with money Negoi\u0163escu had made by selling his leather boots, part of a Guardist's [[paramilitary]] attire.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\n''Euphorion'', Negoi\u0163escu's failed project for a literary magazine, was also his stated attempt at producing a [[Modernist literature|modernist]] literary manifesto. Placing his references in [[German Romanticism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the critic found the tragic figure of Euphorion (in ''[[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|Faust: Part Two]]'') as an ideal image of \"all things new on a spiritual level\".<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> The core idea, occasionally paraphrased as ''Euphorionism'', was defined by Negoi\u0163escu himself in terms of an [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] opposition, with a preference for the former term, and in combination with \"modern Faustianism, that is to say dynamism, imprudent haste.\"<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/><ref name=\"nm167\"/> Seeing in Euphorion a victim of preference for the chaotically modern elements of his own dual nature, and indicating that Goethe had initially intended to give his character a happier and more balanced existence, the theorist stated: \"I shall propose as a goal that initial Euphorion [...]. All contemporary Romantic decadence, the signs of crisis and disaster, such as [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] and Surrealism etc., are consequences of that tear within Euphorion's being. We ought to propose the Goethian restoration.\"<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/>\n\nLiterary historian [[Ion Simu\u0163]], who theorizes a separation between the Circle's ideology and Negoi\u0163escu's own ''Euphorionism'', also notes that, having earlier used Eugen Lovinescu to emancipate himself from Blaga and traditionalism, the young critic and all those who agreed, weary of seeming too detached from their roots, were invoking Goethe as \"an antidote to Lovinescianism, that is to say against sheltering oneself in aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> Simu\u0163 writes that, unlike the Circle's ideological tenets, the newer program was \"ambiguous, idealistic, likely to be approximated, not clearly defined of made concrete\".<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> Overall, Negoi\u0163escu's subsequent work of the time was divided between the influences of Lovinescu and George C\u0103linescu: commenting on this verdict and paraphrasing a statement made by [[\u015etefan Augustin Doina\u015f]], Terian argued that the two mentors had become (respectively) \"the cherished maestro\" and \"the hated maestro\" to Negoi\u0163escu.<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> Also according to Terian, this stance echoed Lovinescu's own ambiguous pronouncements about his rival C\u0103linescu's work.<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> Identifying ''Viitorul literaturii rom\u00e2ne?'' as a watershed moment, at which Negoi\u0163escu found himself disagreeing with both his mentors' core beliefs: on one hand, C\u0103linescu's argument that Romanian literature rested on a peasant culture; on the other, Lovinescu's conclusion that Romania's cultural tendencies did not suggest any stylistic traits that were not also spread among similar civilizations.<ref name=\"atpacat\"/>\n\n===''Poezia lui Eminescu'' and ''Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne''===\nSeen by Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu as both Negoi\u0163escu's only complete work and \"a sort of critical poem\",<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> ''Poezia lui Eminescu'' became one of the most celebrated writings of its author's entire career. Literary historian and columnist [[Mircea Iorgulescu]] described the work as a \"crucial moment in Eminescian exegesis\", equaled only by George C\u0103linescu's 1932 study ''Via\u0163a lui Mihai Eminescu'' (\"The Life of Mihai Eminescu\") and [[Ilina Gregori]]'s 2002 ''Studii literare'' (\"Literary Studies\").<ref name=\"mimomentr\"/> Iorgulescu argues that, although structured as \"a meager pamphlet of a little more than two hundred pages\", the book \"radically changed the understanding of Eminescu and his poetry\".<ref name=\"mimomentr\"/> Overall, the text neglected Eminescu's anthumous poetry and focused on poems only published after the subject's death. It discussed their somber sleep-related imagery, in particular the presence of [[Androgyny|androgynous]] angels, their recurring references to darkness, and their various allusions to the temptation of sin.<ref name=\"sdemin\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Sami Damian]], \"Cine a fost Eminescu?\", in ''[[Idei \u00een Dialog]]'', November 2008</ref> These themes, commonly ignored by Negoi\u0163escu's critical predecessors, were argued to have revealed in Eminescu a \"[[Pluto (mythology)|Plutonian]]\" artist.<ref name=\"sdemin\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.345, 406</ref> \u015etef\u0103nescu believes that Negoi\u0163escu had intended to elude that part of Eminescu's work that had become widely accessible to a \"motley\" public, and instead focused the remaining secrets.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The result of such studies, \u015etef\u0103nescu proposes, has \"the flickering\u2014and blinding\u2014unity of [[magnesium]] flames\", its intensity evoking \"a maddening experience, leaving the experimenter to reemerge with his hair all white.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In \u015etef\u0103nescu's view, the passion felt by the exegete is the [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] equivalent of a physical affair. He writes: \"Nobody, not even [[Veronica Micle]], has loved [Eminescu] as intensely and as tragically as Ion Negoi\u0163escu.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> This dissenting and highly personal view clashed with both critical orthodoxy and other contemporary reevaluations of Eminescu. Negoi\u0163escu's text clashed with the conclusions drawn by Matei C\u0103linescu's in his 1964 book on Eminescu's late poetry (which had mainly focused on the relative impact of [[Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics|Schopenhauerian aesthetics]]).<ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.345-346</ref> Negoi\u0163escu's concentration on Eminescu's posthumous pieces was intensely disputed in later years by literary historian [[Nicolae Manolescu]], who regarded this approach as exclusivist.<ref name=\"pcistoria2\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=5&nr=382 \"Istoria critic\u0103 \u015fi capriciile memoriei canonice (II)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719183602/http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=5&nr=382 |date=2011-07-19 }}, in ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'', Nr. 382</ref>\n\n''Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne'' is seen by \u015etef\u0103nescu as \"not just unfinished, but also never started\": Negoi\u0163escu had only published what was supposed to be its middle part (planning to discuss post-1800 literature in an addenda to a second volume, alongside 20th century works).<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Written earlier, {{lang|ro|Lampa lui Aladin}} was cited by the same critic as an example of Negoi\u0163escu's inconsistency and lack of structure, given that it dealt with \"authors who are unlinked to each other\": Doina\u015f, [[Dan Botta]], [[Mircea Ciobanu]], [[Florin Gabrea]], [[Mircea Iv\u0103nescu]], [[Marin Mincu]], [[Virgil Nemoianu]], [[Toma Pavel]], [[Sebastian Reichmann]], [[Sorin Titel]], [[Daniel Turcea]] and [[Tudor Vasiliu]].<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> \u015etef\u0103nescu added: \"Ion Negoi\u0163escu had the negligence to promise that he would write a history of literature and then, up to the end of his life, felt himself harassed by the interrogative expectation of those around him, as if in the presence of hungry wolf mouths.

He calls the work a \"semi-failure\", and, rejecting the notion that such problems were practical, arising from Negoi\u0163escu's lack of access to the primary sources, finds ''Istoria...'' as symptomatic for its author's inconsistencies.<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> In support of this interpretation, Terian cites Negoi\u0163escu's decision to grant the lesser-known novelist [[Dinu Nicodin]] a prominent entry in the book.<ref name=\"atpacat\"/>\n\nOne of the main purposes of ''Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne'', as stated by Negoi\u0163escu's preface to his work, was to uncover the connections between the specificity of [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] (\"what we Romanians are and how we stand our ground when confronting history\") and the wider [[Culture of Europe|European]] or [[Western culture|Western context]].<ref name=\"ma90\">Albu, p.90</ref> The final version was also a statement against the tenets of [[national communism]], asserting Negoi\u0163escu's belief that Romanian literature did not precede the birth of [[History of modern literature|modern literature]], and that it had developed as an \"imitation of [[Western literature]]\".<ref name=\"ma90\"/> Negoi\u0163escu therefore acknowledged that such a project could only be brought to its completion outside Romania, in a land touched by \"the dawn of liberty\".<ref name=\"ma90\"/>\n\nAlthough incomplete, the book opened various new paths in critical commentary.

Researcher Michaela Mudure argues that, by openly defining masculinity in non-heterosexual terms, the text is one of the \"few and notable\" exceptions within the \"[[Androcentrism|androcentric]]\" literature of [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures.<ref>Michaela Mudure, \"East European Masculinities\", in [[Michael Flood]], Judith Keegan Gardiner, Bob Pease, Keith Pringle (eds.), ''International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities'', [[Routledge]], Abingdon, 2007, p.157.  {{ISBN|0-203-41306-7}}</ref> According to Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu's assessment of the book: \"It is for the first time that a Romanian author analyzes himself with a soberness taken to its last consequences, with even a sort of cruelty, producing confessions that others would not produce even under torture.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> A similar verdict is suggested by literary critic Adriana Stan: \"The calm of extracting moral senses lacks [in Negoi\u0163escu], and his authenticist challenge to 'say it all' almost precipitates itself into an [[exhibitionism]] of a [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] and anti-erotic nature.\"<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/>\n\nThis type of \"insensitivity\" is likened by \u015etef\u0103nescu with that of \"a cadaver on a dissection table\", or \"a statue that we can examine from all sides\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The critic finds the work more daring than any possible analogy in local letters. He compares it to [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]]'s ''Jurnalul unui cobai'' (\"The Diary of a Guinea Pig\"), which is however \"unforgiving\" only with its author's acquaintances; to [[Livius Cioc\u00e2rlie]]'s diaries, which nevertheless \"remain with the limits of literary decency\"; to [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]]'s ''Travesti'' novel, which discusses [[transsexualism]] in metaphors that make it \"less shocking.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same overall comparison was made by critic [[Ioana P\u00e2rvulescu]], who found ''Straja dragonilor'' to evade the tradition of Romanian autobiographical literature, in that it was freed from \"the obsession of the image\", without courting the reader's sympathy.<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> She adds: \"Approaching death is a guarantee for a sincerity of the best quality. The only danger that stalks among the pages is that of time running out, and this provides [...] chaotic impatience and hastening, like the agglomeration of the last sand grains inside the neck of an [[hourglass]].\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> The episodes in Negoi\u0163escu's book portray the boy as a seeker of promiscuous sexual experiences, who enjoys the advances of grownup males (such as his father's [[Batman (military)|orderly]]), but also experiments with girls his own age.<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/><ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> In one narrative sequence, the author recounts how, finding himself inside a dark cinema, he satisfied his urges by fondling the genitalia of an unknown man sitting next to him, thus taking a gamble with public condemnation of a homosexual acts.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Such experiences, Stan proposes, reveal the protagonist-narrator to have been \"[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]\", \"Dionysian\" and \"[[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]]\", characterized by an unwillingness in taking critical distance from \"the object of his contemplation\", and displaying \"a psychology of the excess\".<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/>\n\nAlex. \u015etef\u0103nescu agrees with Negoi\u0163escu's own belief in the book's narrative qualities, arguing that ''Straja dragonilor'' is, after ''Poezia lui Eminescu'', \"the best of all that this feverish and uneven author has ever written\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same commentator commends the volume it for displaying a form of sincerity that was ultimately \"conquered through culture and the experience of writing\", resulting in \"another level\" of a memoir.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> He writes: \"All is beautiful in Ion Negoi\u0163escu's autobiography, even that which is ugly. [...] A reader who is purely spurred on by a prosaic curiosity will find himself disappointed and will abandon it (like the sexually obsessed will abandon a book by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]).\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In P\u00e2rvulescu's view: \"Although they break all sorts of taboos, [...] Negoi\u0163escu's memoirs are so well written that they never veer into vulgarity or obscenity.\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> Likewise, Adriana Stan esteemed the book \"singular in our literature\" and its author's \"capital work\".<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> Also according to \u015etef\u0103nescu, readers who follow the account of young Negoi\u0163escu's spontaneous sexual act at the cinema will sympathize with the protagonist, and even \"breathe a sigh of relief\" to note that his advances were not rejected.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same reviewer finds another outstanding quality of the book in \"the vast depiction of emotional states\", which he believes comparable to sections of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''. In one such fragment, he argues, Negoi\u0163escu presents him child self as \"a strange [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]\", helping his own mother get dressed for a ball and obsessing over every detail in her appearance.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The \"Proustian\" nature is also highlighted by Stan, who argues: \"the recollection performed by the grownup ego has therefore too little in common with a regular, constructed and directed writer's diary.\"<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> Additionally, P\u00e2rvulescu sees an essential quality of the book in its depiction of [[Transylvania]] as both a prolongation of [[Austria-Hungary]]'s \"decadent greatness\" and an area of [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Levant]]ine echoes, \"the [[Ischler cookies]] on the same table as the ''[[qatayef]]''.\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> A section of ''Straja dragonilor'' is based strictly on an inventory of Negoi\u0163escu's genealogy, with insight into his family history. The segment is however deemed \"boring\" by \u015etef\u0103nescu, who notes that the names mentioned \"do not mean anything to us\", but nevertheless acknowledges the \"chill\" they evoke: \"the writer, alerted by the premonition of death, wishes to save [...] all things that he can remember about his forefathers.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/>\n\n''Straja dragonilor'' also includes first-hand detail on Negoi\u0163escu's fascist episode, including the circumstances of his several contributions to the Iron Guardist press and the joy he experienced in late 1940, when the movement managed to assassinate historian and politician [[Nicolae Iorga]].<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> The interval is explained by the memoirist as being related to his [[Identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]]: \"I was being driven by a terrible vital demon, an unprecedented impulse for affirmation, an acute [[individualism]], maybe even an instinctual tendency for domination, all later curbed by my homosexuality, which imposed timidity on me, and eventually by the rigors of history\".<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> Despite this particular frankness, Bogdan Cre\u0163u suggests, the book effectively minimized Negoi\u0163escu's involvement with the fascist causes, by making them seem less relevant to his biography than they actually were.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\nNegoi\u0163escu's other late contribution to the memoir genre was ''Ora oglinzilor'', which groups and rearranges fragments of a diary covering his life between the ages of 16 and 30, as well as [[autofiction]]al pieces (as diaries of fictional characters named Paul and Damian) and [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] homages to French modernist author [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]].<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> According to philologist Florin Rogojan, the full text \"restores Negoi\u0163escu's image as a personality about to be born, reflecting him in his own subjectivity of a being who places all his stakes on creativity.\"<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> In Rogojan's view, the key element in the volume is its author's confessed ability to \"divide himself between the observer and the observed\": \"I have acquired something that all the people on this Earth ought to be envying. [...] I am at once the modeler and the sheer matter I am modeling.\"<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> The book records the young author's own hierarchy of his personal projects, based on the manner in which they could impact on the outside world\u2014from \"my most important work so far\", the diary, to planned (but never written) novels which were meant to celebrate his creative maturity.<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> Rogojan views the introduction of fictionalized elements as a basis for stating the \"cruel truths\" about Negoi\u0163escu's life (the moral problems posed by his own homosexuality or the fear of losing artistic inspiration).<ref name=\"frrefl\"/>\n\n==Civil society activism and political thought==\n\n===General characteristics===\nAccording to literary historian [[Mircea Martin]], Ion Negoi\u0163escu and his Sibiu Circle colleagues represented a larger faction of intellectuals who, once empowered by 1960s [[liberalization]] and the prospect for resuming historical debates, voiced their support for [[Pan-European identity|Europeanism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]]. In Martin's definition, the diverse group includes others who \"had passed through communist prisons\" ([[Adrian Marino]], [[Ovidiu Cotru\u015f]], [[Alexandru Paleologu]]), alongside the disillusioned or reformed [[Romanian Communist Party]] militants ([[Savin Bratu]], [[Vera C\u0103lin]], [[Paul Cornea]], [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]], [[Paul Georgescu]], [[Silvian Iosifescu]]) and a significant number of the younger writers who were only then making their debut.<ref name=\"mmculuraii\">[[Mircea Martin]], [http://www.revista22.ro/cultura-romana-intre-comunism-si-nationalism-ii-241.html \"Cultura rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00eentre comunism \u015fi na\u0163ionalism (II)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427174511/http://www.revista22.ro/cultura-romana-intre-comunism-si-nationalism-ii-241.html |date=2011-04-27 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 660, October 2002</ref> This community, he noted, was primarily reacting against the [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] and [[Protochronism|Protochronist]] ideologies promoted, within the limits defined by the communist regime, by such figures as [[Paul Anghel]], [[Eugen Barbu]], [[Edgar Papu]], [[Mihai Ungheanu]] or [[Dan Zamfirescu]].<ref name=\"mmculuraii\"/>\n\nSimilarly, Norman Manea placed Negoi\u0163escu's public profile in relation with the aesthetic ideals of his work: \"The indestructible attachment toward beauty and aesthetics has fortified the otherwise sober and frail being of the writer through times of Iron Guardist exultation, as well as through times of communist disarray and persecution.

While acknowledging that the political context of the [[Second Vienna Award]] had made \"national sentiment\" more precious to Transylvanians than ever before, the text cautioned against a revival of nationalist exclusiveness in the literary field, and rested the fault for ''p\u0103\u015funism'' with the early 20th century ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' review.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Negoi\u0163escu had designed a portion of the letter as a lampoon targeting \"neo-''S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torists''\", whom he portrayed as [[Demagogy|demagogues]] camouflaged in modernist trappings: \"Burning with the fever of exultation when they yell out the word 'culture' at each and any street corner, all the headmasters of patriotism, or morals and of poetry, in love with the 'holy soil' only because they view it from the comfortable armchairs of the city they still curse, the ''p\u0103\u015funists'' imagine themselves day and night at the plow horns\".<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> In a 1969 letter protesting against marginalization by communists, the author himself argued: \"In what concerns the politically unfavorable atmosphere that has been created around my name, it seems curious to me that those who support it will not bear in mind that, in 1943, I was the author of the Sibiu Literary Circle's Manifesto, through which we protested against fascist ideology.\"<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> He also insisted that his anti-fascist credentials were being recognized by several works of literary history published in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> Commenting on the nature of his 1943 letter, Bogdan Cre\u0163u nevertheless rated it as an updated version of Lovinescu's lifelong principles, rather than a manifesto of artistic difference.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Also according to Cre\u0163u, the young critic's affiliations meant that he was not \"obtusely disregarding\" traditionalist literature in its entirety, noting that Negoi\u0163escu was lenient when it came to poems by traditionalists such as [[George Co\u015fbuc]], [[Octavian Goga]] and [[Aron Cotru\u015f]].<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/>\n\nAt the end of his post-fascist transition, Negoi\u0163escu is even alleged to have rallied with Communist Party-led organizations. Discussing this rumor in his 1946 correspondence with [[Deliu Petroiu]], [[Ion Dezideriu S\u00eerbu]] speculated about the possibility that his friends were merely seeking to survive in a new society facing [[communization]]: \"A certain political indifferentism gives an absurd hue to all hopes for the best. The red dies are cast. [...] The boys have affiliated with the communists. That is to say Nego, Regman and Doina\u015f. They were promised a weekly magazine, funds etc. Nego even hopes for a visa and a passport to France.\"<ref name=\"cuidsinedit\"/> S\u00eerbu expressed a belief that the Sibiu Circle cell could form \"an honest island in this chaos of asserted and legalized ignorance\", and stated that, in case this was not possible, he would join them in planning an escape, through [[Arad County]], to a [[Western Bloc|Western Allied]]-controlled territory.<ref name=\"cuidsinedit\"/>\n\n===Opposition to communism===\nCommentators have often contrasted Negoi\u0163escu's public support for [[Paul Goma]]'s movement and the risk this implied with the perceived lack of solidarity, intimidation or indifference displayed by the cultural establishment of the late 1970s. Discussing the context for the incident, British historian and political analyst [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]] assessed: \"Privileges and carefully modulated intimidation encouraged intellectuals to stay quiet and sometimes even police their professions on behalf of the regime.\"<ref name=\"tgoutcast253\"/> A similar argument, presented by [[Dorin Tudoran]], was paraphrased by [[Monica Lovinescu]]: the two authors singled out Negoi\u0163escu and Vianu as examples of \"solidarity\" among Romanian intellectuals, in contrast to the generic pattern of \"solitude\".<ref name=\"mlresis248\">[[Monica Lovinescu|Monica Lovinesco]], \"La R\u00e9sistance des \u00e9crivains roumains\u2014solitaire ou solidaire?\", in ''L'Autre Europe, 17-18-19. 1988'', [[L'Age d'Homme]], Paris, 1987, p.248</ref> The scarcity of such common initiatives, Monica Lovinescu concluded, clashed with the representative [[civil society]] projects of other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries (the [[Workers' Defence Committee|Workers' Defense Committee]] among them).<ref name=\"mlresis248\"/>\n\nAccording to critic and literary historian [[Gelu Ionescu]] (himself a member of the Radio Free Europe staff), Negoi\u0163escu, Goma and Vianu were the only figures of their day to question \"the legitimacy of the system\", a situation which he believed was rooted in \"the character of Romanians\", particularly their \"fear\".<ref name=\"osgionescu\"/> Himself an author and dissident, [[Virgil T\u0103nase]] reflected back on the period: \"Corrupted and sagged by a too lengthy and complacent convenience [...], Romanian writers viewed Paul Goma's effort with mistrust.

Gelu Ionescu thus notes that the text on patriotism was circumstantial and not, like some by his fellow writers, \"a homage to [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]].\"<ref name=\"osgionescu\"/> C\u0103linescu also noted (emphasis in the original): \"the bad things [Nego] caused by giving in reflected ''only'' on himself (he never signed any deal with the devil; he never, and in no way, implicated anyone else into anything) and [...] these bad things were not irreparable.\"<ref name=\"mciv361\"/>\n\n===Other causes===\nA significant portion of Negoi\u0163escu's political writings provided a critical retrospective on interwar far right and its appeal among intellectuals of the ''[[Tr\u0103irism|Tr\u0103irist]]'' group of philosophers, academics and writers: [[Emil Cioran]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Nae Ionescu]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Petre \u0162u\u0163ea]], [[Mircea Vulc\u0103nescu]] and others. His ''Straja dragonilor'' included reflected on the attraction exercised by the Iron Guard and Codreanu on educated young men of the period, despite the fact that Codreanu's own political manifestos were at an \"embarrassing level\".<ref name=\"nm168\"/> He linked this phenomenon to the generation's reaction against [[rationalism]] and to its preference for [[charisma]], explained by him as \"a disease that was roaming the world at the time and one that could be better explained by theoretical means such as [[crowd psychology]].\"<ref name=\"nm168\"/> In his interpretation, the measure to which these authors had chosen to emancipate themselves from fascism varied: Eliade, Noica and \u0162u\u0163ea \"never cured\", while Cioran, who assimilated a \"[[Nihilism|nihilist]]\" perspective, was an unclear case.<ref name=\"nm168\"/> He also believed that theologian and art critic [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], whose career was related to that of the ''Tr\u0103irists'', \"carried the germ inside him when he proclaimed [[fanaticism]] as a virtue.\"<ref name=\"nm168\"/> Manea interpreted these assessments with caution, arguing that Negoi\u0163escu merged \"names and situations that deserved nuancing\", but noted that they satisfied the urgency of bringing the episodes in question up for public debate.<ref name=\"nm168\"/> Beyond these chronological limits, Negoi\u0163escu also proposed that Eminescu's own form of 19th century nationalism, and even the \"angel of death\" imagery of his posthumous poetry, may have been products of \"the same affliction\".<ref name=\"nm168\"/> His pioneering role in discussing the connection between Eminescu's theories and Romanian fascism was subsequently acknowledged by his fellow literary historians.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=12&nr=351 \"Lovinescu \u015fi Tabla de valori a modernit\u0103\u0163ii rom\u00e2ne\u015fti interbelice\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223120137/http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=12&nr=351 |date=2008-02-23 }}, in ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'', Nr. 351</ref><ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=17&nr=378 \"Despre canon, critic\u0103 \u015fi revizuiri: o recapitulare lovinescian\u0103\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184307/http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=17&nr=378 |date=2011-07-19 }}, in ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'', Nr. 378</ref>\n\nA special portion of Negoi\u0163escu's essays deals with the meeting point between the currents of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the [[Western world]].<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to \"hate the world\", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: \"Is there now a place in the world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where has the world been tarnished and where is it still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?\"<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> Deeming his adversary's statements \"an offense to liberty itself\",<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> Negoi\u0163escu also placed Noica's [[isolationism]] and [[anti-Europeanism]] in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: \"like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [Romanians] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them.\"<ref name=\"ma87-88\"/> He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the [[Cold War]], extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: \"after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context.\"<ref>Albu, p.88</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Negoi\u0163escu published several articles which examined the political developments in [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 Romania]], focusing on the return to popularity of some [[far right]] themes. [[Marta Petreu]] paraphrased their content as \"vocal appeals [warning] that we should not try to build a European Romania on the political ideas of Noica, Eliade, Cioran, Nae Ionescu, Eminescu and Vulc\u0103nescu\".<ref name=\"mplaignel\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Marta Petreu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/laignel-lavastine-metoda-franceza-i-133.html \"Laignel-Lavastine: metoda 'francez\u0103' (I)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201031/http://www.revista22.ro/laignel-lavastine-metoda-franceza-i-133.html |date=2013-10-29 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 642, July 2002</ref> In tandem, Negoi\u0163escu was also rejecting the political stances of [[Post-communism|post-communist]] [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] forces, in particular the ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). In a letter cited by Manea, Negoi\u0163escu strongly rejected the claims publicized by FSN member and former Communist Party activist [[Silviu Brucan]], who had publicly stated that, for lack of \"democratic traditions\", Romania could expect to undergo two decades of transition from communist institutions to a fully fledged [[liberal democracy]].<ref name=\"nm171\">Manea, p.171</ref> He found Brucan's assertion \"insulting\" for Romania's population as a whole, while noting that, between 1881 and 1938, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] had had democratic institutions, and comparing the overall context of the 1990s with Spain's [[Spanish transition to democracy|three-year-long transition]].<ref name=\"nm171\"/> At around the same time, Negoi\u0163escu also reacted against the tendency of some Romanians to reassess their national literature purely on the basis of its political status under communism, primarily noting that various works once considered valuable for their [[subtext]] had come to lose their importance, and called for a reevaluation.<ref name=\"advocea\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Influence===\nNegoi\u0163escu's contribution left a mark on the cultural environment of [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 period]]. In a 2001 essay, Norman Manea argued that Negoi\u0163escu's condemnation of the Iron Guard's ideology, his criticism of post-1989 nationalist revival and his belonging to a sexual minority made him the target of threats and allegations.<ref>Manea, p.168, 169</ref> He concluded: \"To what measure have his aesthetic, existential or political opinions, unavoidably interconnected, bothered and still bother not just part of the Romanian political establishment, but also the cultural one? What significance does the marginalization attempted immediately after 1989 (with its affiliated insults) [...] carry in the Motherland to which he remained painfully and lovingly chained? We do not know who would still have, presently, the patience of picking up on the bitterness of such questions.\"<ref name=\"nm169\"/> Petreu believes that \"taking seriously\" Negoi\u0163escu's anti-fascist messages, alongside Balot\u0103's early demand for Romania to recognize the Antonescu regime's [[Holocaust in Romania|complicity in the Holocaust]], could have engendered a reassessment of the past, thus preventing the resurgence of political and social problems.<ref name=\"mplaignel\"/>\n\nLikewise, Negoi\u0163escu's cultural theses, volumes and presence continued to be interpreted by later literature. [[Ion Simu\u0163]] thus sees ''Euphorionism'' manifested not just in Negoi\u0163escu's essays, but also in the drama writings of Radu Stanca and the \"speculative and meditative\" poems by Doina\u015f.<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> [[Paul Cernat]] wrote that Nicolae Manolescu's own 2008 synthesis on Romanian literary history allocated much space to a debate with his deceased colleague over the classification of Eminescu's contributions.<ref name=\"pcistoria2\"/> During the late years of the 20th century, poet [[Iustin Panta]] founded and edited the Sibiu-based magazine ''Euphorion'',

A rebellious and eccentric figure, Negoi\u0163escu began his career while still an adolescent, and made himself known as a literary ideologue of the 1940s generation. Moving from a youthful affiliation to the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he later came to regret, the author became a disciple of [[Modernist literature|modernist]] doyen [[Eugen Lovinescu]], and, by 1943, rallied the entire Sibiu Circle to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. He was also one of the few openly [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] intellectuals in Romania to have [[Coming out|come out]] before the 1990s\u2014an experience which, like his political commitments, is recorded in his controversial autobiographical writings.\n\nAfter World War II, Negoi\u0163escu's [[anti-communism]], [[dissident]] stance and sexual orientation made him an adversary of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]. Marginalized and [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censored]], he spent three years as a [[political prisoner]]. Ultimately reinstated during a late 1960s episode of [[liberalization]], he continued to speak out against political restrictions, and came to be closely monitored by the [[Securitate]] [[secret police]]. In 1977, he joined [[Paul Goma]] and [[Ion Vianu]] in a [[civil society]] protest against the rule of [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], but was pressured into retracting. Eventually, Negoi\u0163escu [[Defection|defected]] to [[West Germany]], where he became a contributor to [[Radio Free Europe]] and various other anti-communist outlets, as well as editor of literary magazines for the [[Romanian diaspora]] communities. He died in [[Munich]].\n\nIon Negoi\u0163escu's review of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] and contributions to literary theory generally stood in contrast to the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[National communism|national communist]] recourse to traditionalism or [[anti-Europeanism]], and engaged it polemically by advocating the values of [[Western culture]]. His diverse work, although scattered and largely incomplete, drew critical praise for its original takes on various subjects, and primarily for its views on the posthumously published writings of [[national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]].

[[Mihai Gafi\u0163a]] (who held Negoi\u0163escu and his colleague [[Alexandru Piru]] responsible for preserving \"bourgeois ideology\", while urging \"the editorial staffs of literary reviews, the publishing houses [and] the [[Marxism|Marxist]] critics\" to react against this phenomenon);

Its summary version was first published in 1968 by ''Familia'', and instantly made its author the center of attention from several milieus. Having decided not to treat his subjects in the conventional [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] manner encouraged by the authorities, he stirred polemic passions on the literary scene and became a target for surveillance by the authorities.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Negoi\u0163escu's text, which linked Romanian literary history with the development of urban culture,<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> also intrigued the cultural establishment because it seemed to leave out completely all works produced before 1800.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Also in 1968, Negoi\u0163escu moved on from ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' to ''[[Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', where he was also granted an editorial staff office (a position he kept until 1971).<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> That same year, he was allowed to travel beyond the [[Iron Curtain]], but, as he himself recalled, the communist press at home had used the occasion to call him a \"defector\", \"traitor\" and \"fascist\".<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> While in France, Negoi\u0163escu visited [[Monica Lovinescu]], who was by then noted as a literary reviewer for the [[Romanian diaspora]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] spokeswoman.

Literary historian [[Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu]] compares the overall effect to \"a room searched by the Securitate and left a mess.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Noting the same defining characteristic of incompleteness, literary critic [[Bogdan Cre\u0163u]] mentions Negoi\u0163escu's inconsistency as an alternative cause: \"he was a man of great projects which, as a rule, he did not manage to complete.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Despite finding fault in this tendency, Cre\u0163u rates the author as \"the most talented\" among the Sibiu Circle critics, and \"one of the most gifted critics we have ever had.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> The value of his contribution was linked by various commentators with Negoi\u0163escu's approach to literature and, in particular, his personal appreciation of beauty. Such distinctive traits were first discussed by Lovinescu in his 1943 article. Comparing Negoi\u0163escu to both Eminescu and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], the ''Sbur\u0103torul'' theorist insisted on discussing his young disciple's appearance as an exterior sign of literary finesse: \"A fine, feminine, [[Androgyny|androgynous]]; delicacy, shyness, quickly alarmed by some sort of bashfulness betrayed by discreet shades of [[carmine]]. And over all this appearance, a mask of reverie\".<ref name=\"srcerchistii\"/> Cre\u0163u sees Negoi\u0163escu's career as being consumed by \"[[Romanticism|romantic]] gestures or enthusiastic drives, hardly tempered by the prodigious culture of this oversensitive, never matured, [[dandy]].\"<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Referring to their collaboration in the Sibiu Circle during the late 1940s, Balot\u0103 however noted that Negoi\u0163escu was an outspoken critic of those who valued beauty over message, being as such in line with the group's \"ambiguous [[aestheticism]]\".<ref>Balot\u0103, p.199-200</ref> According to Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu, Negoi\u0163escu, a \"solitary and misunderstood\" figure, approached his mission more as an \"[[Po\u00e8te maudit|accursed poet]]\" than a researcher, and found in literature \"a drug\" to \"inject in his veins\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In \u015etef\u0103nescu's view, this fundamental trait, like Negoi\u0163escu's homosexuality, was incompatible with both the \"forceful brutishness\" of communism and the \"prude\" nature of Romanian society.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/>\n\nNovelist and critic [[Norman Manea]] referred to \"the exemplary nature of [Negoi\u0163escu's] case\", as evidence that, contrary to popular opinion, the quality of one's literature \"does not arrive from the ethic to the aesthetic, but the other way around.\"<ref>Manea, p.165</ref> In his assessment, Negoi\u0163escu was \"a minority member, not just an erotic one, but a chosen person, personifying the burning conditioning, truly intrinsic, [...] between freedom and beauty, not just between liberty and morality\".<ref name=\"nm167\">Manea, p.167</ref> Similarly, [[Matei C\u0103linescu]] recalled being \"fascinated\" by \"his vigorous '[[Decadent movement|decadent]]' aestheticism which was however paradoxically doubled by a major moral intransigence in matters of art and artistic truth\".<ref name=\"mciv343\"/> He believed Negoi\u0163escu's artistic vision to feature \"a hidden moral edge\", one occasionally turning back \"on himself\", and making Negoi\u0163escu \"one of the major ethical figures in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]].\"<ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.362</ref> A similar verdict was provided by [[Ion Vianu]]: \"his proud demeanor, the rigorous aestheticism he professed were the expression of an extreme exigence, as expanded on the artistic level as it was on the moral one.\"<ref name=\"mciv406\">C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.406</ref> Such aspects prompted Bogdan Cre\u0163u to suggest that Negoi\u0163escu's work was primarily characterized by a \"critical consciousness\", made possible by his \"specific [and] tragic [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionism]]\": \"although it caused him great distress during his lifetime [...], it compelled him to become, no matter what the risks, consistent with himself; that is to say honest, enthusiastic, genuine.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\nAs negative consequences of Negoi\u0163escu's aestheticism, \u015etef\u0103nescu cites his \"excess of solemnity\" and the \"excessive shyness\" of his critical essays, as well as a lack of determination and a tendency toward \"[[autosuggestion]]\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Likewise, writer [[Andrei Terian]] saw Negoi\u0163escu as lacking a critic's \"literary head\", being instead an \"avid consumer of art\" with \"an immense sensual appetite\".<ref name=\"atpacat\"/> In reference to the issue of critic versus artist, \u015etef\u0103nescu argues: \"He would provide contradictory verdicts. He would most often allow himself to be guided by the will to experience a moment of aesthetic beatitude. Whenever he lacked literary [[heroin]], he would settle for a weak text [...]. He loved depths so much that he invented them.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> He and other commentators assess that Negoi\u0163escu's self-avowed love for literature and books as objects was almost physical in nature.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/><ref name=\"astansimturi\"/>\n\n===Early works and ''Euphorion'' ideals===\nA substantial and precocious element of Negoi\u0163escu's critical work was constituted by his focus on [[Mateiu Caragiale]]. Bogdan Cre\u0163u, who notes the enthusiastic reception Negoi\u0163escu granted to Caragiale's poetic work in his very first published essay, believes there is an intrinsic connection between the two figures at the level of aestheticism.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> According to Ion Vianu, the \"beautiful, pale and distant\" Negoi\u0163escu brought to mind Aubrey de Vere, the \"morbid aristocrat\" in Caragiale's novella ''Remember''.<ref>C\u0103linescu & Vianu, p.405-406</ref> Negoi\u0163escu's lifelong appreciation of Caragiale's work, specifically his claim that ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' novel was a masterpiece formed around a \"secret architecture\", was contested by literary critic and [[English studies|Anglicist]] [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]]. Mih\u0103ie\u015f described ''Craii...'' a sample of \"pretentious [[kitsch]]\", and accused his various colleagues of having artificially increased Caragiale's cultural rating.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Mircea Mih\u0103ie\u015f]], [http://www.romlit.ro/care_e_cea_mai_proast_carte_romneasc \"Care e cea mai proast\u0103 carte rom\u00e2neasc\u0103?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903115112/http://www.romlit.ro/care_e_cea_mai_proast_carte_romneasc |date=2009-09-03 }}, in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 31/2009</ref>\n\nBy 1945, Cre\u0163u argues, Negoi\u0163escu had reached his creative maturity, primarily by perfecting the \"[[deconstruction]]\" of texts making the object of his reviews.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> In particular, Cre\u0163u sees as outstanding the young critic's verdicts on George C\u0103linescu's novel ''[[Enigma Otiliei]]'' (where Negoi\u0163escu had identified, probably ahead of all other commentators, a level of [[parody]] running underneath the formal borrowings from [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]) and on the poems of [[George Bacovia]] (compared by Negoi\u0163escu to the overall artistic standards of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist circles]], with which Bacovia had been formally affiliated).<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> Written in parallel, ''Povestea trist\u0103 a lui Ramon Ocg'', described by \u015etef\u0103nescu as marking Negoi\u0163escu's brief affiliation with [[Surrealism]],<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> romanticizes the life of Mexican film star [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]], with emphasis on Navarro's homosexuality.<ref name=\"acceptstraja\"/> In Bogdan Cre\u0163u's definition, the book shows Negoi\u0163escu's commitment to anti-fascism, and especially his use of [[satire]] against \"the fascist ideology, with all its abuses.\"<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/> Cre\u0163u also notes that the printing of ''Povestea trist\u0103...'' was financed with money Negoi\u0163escu had made by selling his leather boots, part of a Guardist's [[paramilitary]] attire.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\n''Euphorion'', Negoi\u0163escu's failed project for a literary magazine, was also his stated attempt at producing a [[Modernist literature|modernist]] literary manifesto. Placing his references in [[German Romanticism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the critic found the tragic figure of Euphorion (in ''[[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|Faust: Part Two]]'') as an ideal image of \"all things new on a spiritual level\".<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> The core idea, occasionally paraphrased as ''Euphorionism'', was defined by Negoi\u0163escu himself in terms of an [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] opposition, with a preference for the former term, and in combination with \"modern Faustianism, that is to say dynamism, imprudent haste.\"<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/><ref name=\"nm167\"/> Seeing in Euphorion a victim of preference for the chaotically modern elements of his own dual nature, and indicating that Goethe had initially intended to give his character a happier and more balanced existence, the theorist stated: \"I shall propose as a goal that initial Euphorion [...]. All contemporary Romantic decadence, the signs of crisis and disaster, such as [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] and Surrealism etc., are consequences of that tear within Euphorion's being.

Literary historian and columnist [[Mircea Iorgulescu]] described the work as a \"crucial moment in Eminescian exegesis\", equaled only by George C\u0103linescu's 1932 study ''Via\u0163a lui Mihai Eminescu'' (\"The Life of Mihai Eminescu\") and [[Ilina Gregori]]'s 2002 ''Studii literare'' (\"Literary Studies\").<ref name=\"mimomentr\"/> Iorgulescu argues that, although structured as \"a meager pamphlet of a little more than two hundred pages\", the book \"radically changed the understanding of Eminescu and his poetry\".<ref name=\"mimomentr\"/> Overall, the text neglected Eminescu's anthumous poetry and focused on poems only published after the subject's death.

He compares it to [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]]'s ''Jurnalul unui cobai'' (\"The Diary of a Guinea Pig\"), which is however \"unforgiving\" only with its author's acquaintances; to [[Livius Cioc\u00e2rlie]]'s diaries, which nevertheless \"remain with the limits of literary decency\"; to [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]]'s ''Travesti'' novel, which discusses [[transsexualism]] in metaphors that make it \"less shocking.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same overall comparison was made by critic [[Ioana P\u00e2rvulescu]], who found ''Straja dragonilor'' to evade the tradition of Romanian autobiographical literature, in that it was freed from \"the obsession of the image\", without courting the reader's sympathy.<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> She adds: \"Approaching death is a guarantee for a sincerity of the best quality. The only danger that stalks among the pages is that of time running out, and this provides [...] chaotic impatience and hastening, like the agglomeration of the last sand grains inside the neck of an [[hourglass]].\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> The episodes in Negoi\u0163escu's book portray the boy as a seeker of promiscuous sexual experiences, who enjoys the advances of grownup males (such as his father's [[Batman (military)|orderly]]), but also experiments with girls his own age.<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/><ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> In one narrative sequence, the author recounts how, finding himself inside a dark cinema, he satisfied his urges by fondling the genitalia of an unknown man sitting next to him, thus taking a gamble with public condemnation of a homosexual acts.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> Such experiences, Stan proposes, reveal the protagonist-narrator to have been \"[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]\", \"Dionysian\" and \"[[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]]\", characterized by an unwillingness in taking critical distance from \"the object of his contemplation\", and displaying \"a psychology of the excess\".<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/>\n\nAlex. \u015etef\u0103nescu agrees with Negoi\u0163escu's own belief in the book's narrative qualities, arguing that ''Straja dragonilor'' is, after ''Poezia lui Eminescu'', \"the best of all that this feverish and uneven author has ever written\".<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same commentator commends the volume it for displaying a form of sincerity that was ultimately \"conquered through culture and the experience of writing\", resulting in \"another level\" of a memoir.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> He writes: \"All is beautiful in Ion Negoi\u0163escu's autobiography, even that which is ugly. [...] A reader who is purely spurred on by a prosaic curiosity will find himself disappointed and will abandon it (like the sexually obsessed will abandon a book by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]).\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> In P\u00e2rvulescu's view: \"Although they break all sorts of taboos, [...] Negoi\u0163escu's memoirs are so well written that they never veer into vulgarity or obscenity.\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> Likewise, Adriana Stan esteemed the book \"singular in our literature\" and its author's \"capital work\".<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> Also according to \u015etef\u0103nescu, readers who follow the account of young Negoi\u0163escu's spontaneous sexual act at the cinema will sympathize with the protagonist, and even \"breathe a sigh of relief\" to note that his advances were not rejected.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The same reviewer finds another outstanding quality of the book in \"the vast depiction of emotional states\", which he believes comparable to sections of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''. In one such fragment, he argues, Negoi\u0163escu presents him child self as \"a strange [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]\", helping his own mother get dressed for a ball and obsessing over every detail in her appearance.<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/> The \"Proustian\" nature is also highlighted by Stan, who argues: \"the recollection performed by the grownup ego has therefore too little in common with a regular, constructed and directed writer's diary.\"<ref name=\"astansimturi\"/> Additionally, P\u00e2rvulescu sees an essential quality of the book in its depiction of [[Transylvania]] as both a prolongation of [[Austria-Hungary]]'s \"decadent greatness\" and an area of [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Levant]]ine echoes, \"the [[Ischler cookies]] on the same table as the ''[[qatayef]]''.\"<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> A section of ''Straja dragonilor'' is based strictly on an inventory of Negoi\u0163escu's genealogy, with insight into his family history. The segment is however deemed \"boring\" by \u015etef\u0103nescu, who notes that the names mentioned \"do not mean anything to us\", but nevertheless acknowledges the \"chill\" they evoke: \"the writer, alerted by the premonition of death, wishes to save [...] all things that he can remember about his forefathers.\"<ref name=\"asnegoit\"/>\n\n''Straja dragonilor'' also includes first-hand detail on Negoi\u0163escu's fascist episode, including the circumstances of his several contributions to the Iron Guardist press and the joy he experienced in late 1940, when the movement managed to assassinate historian and politician [[Nicolae Iorga]].<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> The interval is explained by the memoirist as being related to his [[Identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]]: \"I was being driven by a terrible vital demon, an unprecedented impulse for affirmation, an acute [[individualism]], maybe even an instinctual tendency for domination, all later curbed by my homosexuality, which imposed timidity on me, and eventually by the rigors of history\".<ref name=\"iprataciri\"/> Despite this particular frankness, Bogdan Cre\u0163u suggests, the book effectively minimized Negoi\u0163escu's involvement with the fascist causes, by making them seem less relevant to his biography than they actually were.<ref name=\"bcdeven2\"/>\n\nNegoi\u0163escu's other late contribution to the memoir genre was ''Ora oglinzilor'', which groups and rearranges fragments of a diary covering his life between the ages of 16 and 30, as well as [[autofiction]]al pieces (as diaries of fictional characters named Paul and Damian) and [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] homages to French modernist author [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]].<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> According to philologist Florin Rogojan, the full text \"restores Negoi\u0163escu's image as a personality about to be born, reflecting him in his own subjectivity of a being who places all his stakes on creativity.\"<ref name=\"frrefl\"/> In Rogojan's view, the key element in the volume is its author's confessed ability to \"divide himself between the observer and the observed\": \"I have acquired something that all the people on this Earth ought to be envying.

In Martin's definition, the diverse group includes others who \"had passed through communist prisons\" ([[Adrian Marino]], [[Ovidiu Cotru\u015f]], [[Alexandru Paleologu]]), alongside the disillusioned or reformed [[Romanian Communist Party]] militants ([[Savin Bratu]], [[Vera C\u0103lin]], [[Paul Cornea]], [[Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu]], [[Paul Georgescu]], [[Silvian Iosifescu]]) and a significant number of the younger writers who were only then making their debut.<ref name=\"mmculuraii\">[[Mircea Martin]], [http://www.revista22.ro/cultura-romana-intre-comunism-si-nationalism-ii-241.html \"Cultura rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00eentre comunism \u015fi na\u0163ionalism (II)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427174511/http://www.revista22.ro/cultura-romana-intre-comunism-si-nationalism-ii-241.html |date=2011-04-27 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 660, October 2002</ref> This community, he noted, was primarily reacting against the [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] and [[Protochronism|Protochronist]] ideologies promoted, within the limits defined by the communist regime, by such figures as [[Paul Anghel]], [[Eugen Barbu]], [[Edgar Papu]], [[Mihai Ungheanu]] or [[Dan Zamfirescu]].<ref name=\"mmculuraii\"/>\n\nSimilarly, Norman Manea placed Negoi\u0163escu's public profile in relation with the aesthetic ideals of his work: \"The indestructible attachment toward beauty and aesthetics has fortified the otherwise sober and frail being of the writer through times of Iron Guardist exultation, as well as through times of communist disarray and persecution.

While acknowledging that the political context of the [[Second Vienna Award]] had made \"national sentiment\" more precious to Transylvanians than ever before, the text cautioned against a revival of nationalist exclusiveness in the literary field, and rested the fault for ''p\u0103\u015funism'' with the early 20th century ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' review.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Negoi\u0163escu had designed a portion of the letter as a lampoon targeting \"neo-''S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torists''\", whom he portrayed as [[Demagogy|demagogues]] camouflaged in modernist trappings: \"Burning with the fever of exultation when they yell out the word 'culture' at each and any street corner, all the headmasters of patriotism, or morals and of poetry, in love with the 'holy soil' only because they view it from the comfortable armchairs of the city they still curse, the ''p\u0103\u015funists'' imagine themselves day and night at the plow horns\".<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> In a 1969 letter protesting against marginalization by communists, the author himself argued: \"In what concerns the politically unfavorable atmosphere that has been created around my name, it seems curious to me that those who support it will not bear in mind that, in 1943, I was the author of the Sibiu Literary Circle's Manifesto, through which we protested against fascist ideology.\"<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> He also insisted that his anti-fascist credentials were being recognized by several works of literary history published in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"srevacuarea\"/> Commenting on the nature of his 1943 letter, Bogdan Cre\u0163u nevertheless rated it as an updated version of Lovinescu's lifelong principles, rather than a manifesto of artistic difference.<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/> Also according to Cre\u0163u, the young critic's affiliations meant that he was not \"obtusely disregarding\" traditionalist literature in its entirety, noting that Negoi\u0163escu was lenient when it came to poems by traditionalists such as [[George Co\u015fbuc]], [[Octavian Goga]] and [[Aron Cotru\u015f]].<ref name=\"bcdeven1\"/>\n\nAt the end of his post-fascist transition, Negoi\u0163escu is even alleged to have rallied with Communist Party-led organizations. Discussing this rumor in his 1946 correspondence with [[Deliu Petroiu]], [[Ion Dezideriu S\u00eerbu]] speculated about the possibility that his friends were merely seeking to survive in a new society facing [[communization]]: \"A certain political indifferentism gives an absurd hue to all hopes for the best. The red dies are cast. [...] The boys have affiliated with the communists. That is to say Nego, Regman and Doina\u015f. They were promised a weekly magazine, funds etc. Nego even hopes for a visa and a passport to France.\"<ref name=\"cuidsinedit\"/> S\u00eerbu expressed a belief that the Sibiu Circle cell could form \"an honest island in this chaos of asserted and legalized ignorance\", and stated that, in case this was not possible, he would join them in planning an escape, through [[Arad County]], to a [[Western Bloc|Western Allied]]-controlled territory.<ref name=\"cuidsinedit\"/>\n\n===Opposition to communism===\nCommentators have often contrasted Negoi\u0163escu's public support for [[Paul Goma]]'s movement and the risk this implied with the perceived lack of solidarity, intimidation or indifference displayed by the cultural establishment of the late 1970s. Discussing the context for the incident, British historian and political analyst [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]] assessed: \"Privileges and carefully modulated intimidation encouraged intellectuals to stay quiet and sometimes even police their professions on behalf of the regime.\"<ref name=\"tgoutcast253\"/> A similar argument, presented by [[Dorin Tudoran]], was paraphrased by [[Monica Lovinescu]]: the two authors singled out Negoi\u0163escu and Vianu as examples of \"solidarity\" among Romanian intellectuals, in contrast to the generic pattern of \"solitude\".<ref name=\"mlresis248\">[[Monica Lovinescu|Monica Lovinesco]], \"La R\u00e9sistance des \u00e9crivains roumains\u2014solitaire ou solidaire?\", in ''L'Autre Europe, 17-18-19. 1988'', [[L'Age d'Homme]], Paris, 1987, p.248</ref> The scarcity of such common initiatives, Monica Lovinescu concluded, clashed with the representative [[civil society]] projects of other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries (the [[Workers' Defence Committee|Workers' Defense Committee]] among them).<ref name=\"mlresis248\"/>\n\nAccording to critic and literary historian [[Gelu Ionescu]] (himself a member of the Radio Free Europe staff), Negoi\u0163escu, Goma and Vianu were the only figures of their day to question \"the legitimacy of the system\", a situation which he believed was rooted in \"the character of Romanians\", particularly their \"fear\".<ref name=\"osgionescu\"/> Himself an author and dissident, [[Virgil T\u0103nase]] reflected back on the period: \"Corrupted and sagged by a too lengthy and complacent convenience [...], Romanian writers viewed Paul Goma's effort with mistrust.

Gelu Ionescu thus notes that the text on patriotism was circumstantial and not, like some by his fellow writers, \"a homage to [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]].\"<ref name=\"osgionescu\"/> C\u0103linescu also noted (emphasis in the original): \"the bad things [Nego] caused by giving in reflected ''only'' on himself (he never signed any deal with the devil; he never, and in no way, implicated anyone else into anything) and [...] these bad things were not irreparable.\"<ref name=\"mciv361\"/>\n\n===Other causes===\nA significant portion of Negoi\u0163escu's political writings provided a critical retrospective on interwar far right and its appeal among intellectuals of the ''[[Tr\u0103irism|Tr\u0103irist]]'' group of philosophers, academics and writers: [[Emil Cioran]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Nae Ionescu]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Petre \u0162u\u0163ea]], [[Mircea Vulc\u0103nescu]] and others. His ''Straja dragonilor'' included reflected on the attraction exercised by the Iron Guard and Codreanu on educated young men of the period, despite the fact that Codreanu's own political manifestos were at an \"embarrassing level\".<ref name=\"nm168\"/> He linked this phenomenon to the generation's reaction against [[rationalism]] and to its preference for [[charisma]], explained by him as \"a disease that was roaming the world at the time and one that could be better explained by theoretical means such as [[crowd psychology]].\"<ref name=\"nm168\"/> In his interpretation, the measure to which these authors had chosen to emancipate themselves from fascism varied: Eliade, Noica and \u0162u\u0163ea \"never cured\", while Cioran, who assimilated a \"[[Nihilism|nihilist]]\" perspective, was an unclear case.<ref name=\"nm168\"/> He also believed that theologian and art critic [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], whose career was related to that of the ''Tr\u0103irists'', \"carried the germ inside him when he proclaimed [[fanaticism]] as a virtue.\"<ref name=\"nm168\"/> Manea interpreted these assessments with caution, arguing that Negoi\u0163escu merged \"names and situations that deserved nuancing\", but noted that they satisfied the urgency of bringing the episodes in question up for public debate.<ref name=\"nm168\"/> Beyond these chronological limits, Negoi\u0163escu also proposed that Eminescu's own form of 19th century nationalism, and even the \"angel of death\" imagery of his posthumous poetry, may have been products of \"the same affliction\".<ref name=\"nm168\"/> His pioneering role in discussing the connection between Eminescu's theories and Romanian fascism was subsequently acknowledged by his fellow literary historians.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=12&nr=351 \"Lovinescu \u015fi Tabla de valori a modernit\u0103\u0163ii rom\u00e2ne\u015fti interbelice\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223120137/http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=12&nr=351 |date=2008-02-23 }}, in ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'', Nr. 351</ref><ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=17&nr=378 \"Despre canon, critic\u0103 \u015fi revizuiri: o recapitulare lovinescian\u0103\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719184307/http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=17&nr=378 |date=2011-07-19 }}, in ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul (literary magazine)|Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'', Nr. 378</ref>\n\nA special portion of Negoi\u0163escu's essays deals with the meeting point between the currents of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the [[Western world]].<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to \"hate the world\", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: \"Is there now a place in the world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where has the world been tarnished and where is it still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?\"<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> Deeming his adversary's statements \"an offense to liberty itself\",<ref name=\"mmculuravii\"/> Negoi\u0163escu also placed Noica's [[isolationism]] and [[anti-Europeanism]] in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: \"like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [Romanians] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them.\"<ref name=\"ma87-88\"/> He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the [[Cold War]], extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: \"after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context.\"<ref>Albu, p.88</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Negoi\u0163escu published several articles which examined the political developments in [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 Romania]], focusing on the return to popularity of some [[far right]] themes. [[Marta Petreu]] paraphrased their content as \"vocal appeals [warning] that we should not try to build a European Romania on the political ideas of Noica, Eliade, Cioran, Nae Ionescu, Eminescu and Vulc\u0103nescu\".<ref name=\"mplaignel\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Marta Petreu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/laignel-lavastine-metoda-franceza-i-133.html \"Laignel-Lavastine: metoda 'francez\u0103' (I)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201031/http://www.revista22.ro/laignel-lavastine-metoda-franceza-i-133.html |date=2013-10-29 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 642, July 2002</ref> In tandem, Negoi\u0163escu was also rejecting the political stances of [[Post-communism|post-communist]] [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] forces, in particular the ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). In a letter cited by Manea, Negoi\u0163escu strongly rejected the claims publicized by FSN member and former Communist Party activist [[Silviu Brucan]], who had publicly stated that, for lack of \"democratic traditions\", Romania could expect to undergo two decades of transition from communist institutions to a fully fledged [[liberal democracy]].<ref name=\"nm171\">Manea, p.171</ref> He found Brucan's assertion \"insulting\" for Romania's population as a whole, while noting that, between 1881 and 1938, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] had had democratic institutions, and comparing the overall context of the 1990s with Spain's [[Spanish transition to democracy|three-year-long transition]].<ref name=\"nm171\"/> At around the same time, Negoi\u0163escu also reacted against the tendency of some Romanians to reassess their national literature purely on the basis of its political status under communism, primarily noting that various works once considered valuable for their [[subtext]] had come to lose their importance, and called for a reevaluation.<ref name=\"advocea\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Influence===\nNegoi\u0163escu's contribution left a mark on the cultural environment of [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 period]]. In a 2001 essay, Norman Manea argued that Negoi\u0163escu's condemnation of the Iron Guard's ideology, his criticism of post-1989 nationalist revival and his belonging to a sexual minority made him the target of threats and allegations.<ref>Manea, p.168, 169</ref> He concluded: \"To what measure have his aesthetic, existential or political opinions, unavoidably interconnected, bothered and still bother not just part of the Romanian political establishment, but also the cultural one? What significance does the marginalization attempted immediately after 1989 (with its affiliated insults) [...] carry in the Motherland to which he remained painfully and lovingly chained? We do not know who would still have, presently, the patience of picking up on the bitterness of such questions.\"<ref name=\"nm169\"/> Petreu believes that \"taking seriously\" Negoi\u0163escu's anti-fascist messages, alongside Balot\u0103's early demand for Romania to recognize the Antonescu regime's [[Holocaust in Romania|complicity in the Holocaust]], could have engendered a reassessment of the past, thus preventing the resurgence of political and social problems.<ref name=\"mplaignel\"/>\n\nLikewise, Negoi\u0163escu's cultural theses, volumes and presence continued to be interpreted by later literature. [[Ion Simu\u0163]] thus sees ''Euphorionism'' manifested not just in Negoi\u0163escu's essays, but also in the drama writings of Radu Stanca and the \"speculative and meditative\" poems by Doina\u015f.<ref name=\"iscerchism\"/> [[Paul Cernat]] wrote that Nicolae Manolescu's own 2008 synthesis on Romanian literary history allocated much space to a debate with his deceased colleague over the classification of Eminescu's contributions.<ref name=\"pcistoria2\"/> During the late years of the 20th century, poet [[Iustin Panta]] founded and edited the Sibiu-based magazine ''Euphorion'', which owed partial inspiration to Negoi\u0163escu's project and had Doina\u015f as its honorary director.<ref>{{in lang|ro}}

to which [[Petru Romo\u015fan]] had been a [[Securitate]] delator was asserted on the basis of archive material kept by the [[CNSAS]] government agency.<ref name=\"mcromosan\"/> One such document

life.<ref name=\"mcromosan\"/> Also cited was a 1985 statement by Securitate colonel Victor Achim, responsible for reporting on the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Union]], who assessed that Romo\u015fan was \"our link on critic Ion Negoi\u0163escu\", acknowledging the role played by such information in getting Negoi\u0163escu to \"admit his guilt\".<ref name=\"mcromosan\"/> Another note, issued after Romo\u015fan's own departure for [[People's Republic of Hungary]] (and subsequent defection to the West), told of a plan to make him the target of a negative campaign by leaking

By 1938 about 1,450 employees are working for the company. With beginning of World War 2 Sauer & Sohn is manufacturing more military firearms again, after 1941 production serves the war effort almost exclusively. Next to [[Mauser]] the company 'Sauer & Sohn' is becoming one of the most important manufacturers of the German standard rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]]. Among the better known is the [[M30 Luftwaffe drilling]], a survival gun for air crews. Meanwhile, the 'Maschinenkarabiner 42' (MKb 42) is developed by ''C.&nbsp;G. Haenel'' in the Suhl, and a competing model by ''Walther''. It will become the 'Maschinenpistole 43' (MP 43) and later the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] This weapon is manufactured in numbers by Sauer and other companies. Production will continue after the war for newly formed armed forces, e.g. the [[Volkspolizei]] of [[East Germany]] (DDR or GDR).\n\n==== Sauer Modell 38H Pistol====\n\n[[File:Smolensk-War-Museum-16.jpg|thumb|Modell 38H, Smolensk War Museum.]]\nOf particular note is the company's ''[[Sauer 38H]]'', the first mass-produced semi-automatic pistol to feature a cocking/de-cocking lever. It was a very advanced pocket pistol design made in .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP. It was adopted as German alternate standard as 'Modell 38' and was widely used by air and tank forces. Full length is 158.75mm, barrel length is 84 2/3mm, mass is 737.088g with a magazine capacity of eight. The action has a cocker/de-cocker lever that can control the concealed hammer.

In April 1945 the U.S. Army arrives in Suhl, in early July the area is ceded to the Soviets. The company assets were seized without compensation end of October. This is confirmed by Communists in 1948, Rolf Sauer will move to West Germany.<ref name=\"GermanHuntingGuns-GunMakers&DealersP-T\" /> Hans Sauer is deported by the Soviet occupational government and never heard from again, he probably dies in 1946. The machinery, as happened with most of the industrial companies that had been located in East Germany, was mostly dismantled and moved East. Beginning 1946 to 1948, formerly independent companies in East Germany, or what was left of them, were restructured and finally merged into industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s.<ref name=\"VEB-Th\u00e4lmann\">{{Cite web|url=http://deutsches-jagd-lexikon.de/index.php?title=VEB_Fahrzeug-_und_Jagdwaffenwerk_%22Ernst_Th%C3%A4lmann%22|title=VEB Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|accessdate=January 11, 2020}} (german)</ref>\n\nIn Suhl the original ''J.&nbsp;P.

Haenel'' (which had been renamed to ''VEB [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann]]-Werk Suhl'') is starting production again in 1948, by 1954 the ''Fortuna'' (ex Sauer & Sohn) and 'Merkel' plant parts were attached to the 'Th\u00e4lmann Works' as 'Produktionsbereiche' (PB, production areas). Now hunting weapons, later also small calibre and sporting firearms and airguns are being manufactured again. The firm ''Simson & Co.'' (renamed to ''VEB Fahrzeug und Ger\u00e4tewerk Simson Suhl''), first producing bicycles, then [[moped]]s, motorbikes and also firearms, is included to the group. The weapons manufacturing is taken over by the 'Th\u00e4lmann Works', until all companies mentioned are finally merged into the ''VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk'' \"''Ernst Th\u00e4lmann''\" in 1968.<ref name=\"VEB-Th\u00e4lmann\" />\n\nThe well-known trademarks were also still being used by East Germany, e.g. to sell products abroad, until 1970 with the companies being united, the use of the trade names 'Sauer und Sohn (Suhl)', 'Fortuna (Suhl)', 'C.&nbsp;G. Haenel (Suhl)', 'Gebr. Merkel (Suhl)', and 'Simson (Suhl)' (the latter only for weapons) were dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kallmyers, Arfamann|title=J. P.

Sauer & Sohn''.<ref name=\"GermanHuntingGuns-J.P. Sauer\" /> Experienced workers from Suhl had joined, and the production of hunting firearms, and later pistols, was begun the same year. Export markets were a.o. Scandinavia and the US, Brasil and Pakistan. The company grew bigger soon, and employed over 400 people by the mid-1960s. In 1966 the ''Kompressorenfabrik Wilhelm Poppe'' in [[Kiel]] is taking over the 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn'. In 1968 'Wilhelm Poppe' merged with other companies into ''J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH'', mechanical engineering becoming a main branch of business. An independent company ''Sauer Getriebe KG'' is established in 1969 in [[Neum\u00fcnster]]. \n\nIn 1972 Rolf-Dietrich Sauer died. In 1975 'Sauer Getriebe' took over plants in Aachen and Kiel from 'Sauer Maschinenbau'<ref>[https://www.sauercompressors.com/company/sauer-compressors-group/our-corporate-history/ Our corporate history _ Sauer Compressors]</ref>, and in 1976 the 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau' sold their hunting arms business in Eckernf\u00f6rde to the ''[[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]]'' (SIG), a company which had developed firearms from the 1860s onwards.\n\n=== Sauer as Part of SIG ===\nSwiss law of neutrality limits the ability of firearms manufacturers to export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/ch-industry.htm|title=Swiss Arms Industry |first=John|last=Pike |website=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> Companies which wish to do so may be using a foreign partner. These restrictions prevented 'SIG' from exploiting a new design concept they had developed. The design resulted from the creation at that time of a new form of industrial production equipment, known as the \"Automatic Screw Machine\", which was introduced by the company. While 'SIG' had produced a very high quality handgun in their ''P210'' model, it was also expensive to manufacture, required machining operations at high levels of precision. This produced a firearm that was known for its accuracy, but too expensive to be sold to a wider market. \n\nSpurred by the necessity to partner with a foreign company in order to profit from their production machinery and the items it could produce 'SIG' chose the German firm of 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn'. In joining they also combined their expertise in firearms design. As a result, the '''SIG Sauer GmbH''' (Eckernf\u00f6rde) as small arms business was founded, the '''[[Swiss Arms|SAN SIG Arms AG]]''' (Neuhausen) as manufacturer being kept (later renamed to ''Swiss Arms AG''), and the '''[[SIG Sauer]]''' branch and brand name created. The declared goal was to expand market share and to be of international relevance in the small arms industry.\nIn 1985 the company '''[[SIG Sauer|SIGARMS, Inc.]]''' was established (in Virginia), to import and distribute firearms into the US market (later renamed to ''SIG Sauer, Inc.''). \n\n* 1971 \u2014 'SIG' purchased sporting arms manufacturer '''[[H\u00e4mmerli]]''' based in [[Lenzburg]], Switzerland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haemmerli.info/en/home.html|title=Home|website=haemmerli.info|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>. \n* 1975/76 \u2014 'SIG' forms partnership with hunting arms manufacturer 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn' (Eckernf\u00f6rde) to expand their arms division. \n* 1997 \u2014 German '''[[Blaser]] Jagdwaffen''' ([[Isny]]) and 'SIGARMS' merge. Blaser, now part of 'SIG', continues autonomously developing and producing.  \n* 1999 \u2014 The ''Rheinmetall AG'' sells civilian market part of 'Mauser' to Blaser/'SIG', it becomes '''[[Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH]]'''.<ref name=\"Mauserguns-History\">{{cite web|title=Mauser History|url=http://www.mauserguns.com/mauser-history|website=mauserguns.com|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> The part owned by 'Rheinmetall' is named 'Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH'.<ref name=\"Mauser - The Mauser History\">{{cite web|title=The Mauser History|url=https://www.mauser.com/en/mauser-world/history/|website=mauser.com|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== The first SIG Sauer handgun ====\n\nTo satisfy the needs of Swiss military and police, a new handgun model was created by the ''[[SIG Sauer]] GmbH'', which incorporated some features from the 'SIG P210' and 'Sauer Modell 38H', simplified for more efficient cost of construction on the new 'SIG' developed machinery. Result was a new type of action for a locked-breech semi-automatic pistol, with a new high quality smooth operating double/single-action trigger, a safe hammer lowering device, automatic firing pin block, and easy disassembly for cleaning. This new concept handgun was named [[SIG Sauer P220]].\n\nPrior to World War II, Sauer had been primarily a maker of [[shotgun]]s and hunting [[rifle]]s. During the war they produced a new handgun, the ''Sauer 38H'', but afterwards withdraw from this market. The 'Sauer 38H' had been produced in competition with other German makers, such as 'Mauser' and 'Walther', at a time when new designs began to feature a double/single-action trigger. \nWith 'SIG' as their partner/owner, 'Sauer' returned to the business of manufacturing handguns. In 1975 the ''SIG Sauer'' line of handguns began with the ''SIG P220''.<ref name=\"Ayoob2014\"/> The double-action trigger mechanism combined with advanced safety features, including the hammer lowering decocking lever, were contributed by 'Sauer' to the new ''P220'' design.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=W. H. B.|title=Book of Pistols and Rifles|date=1968|publisher=Stackpole|pages=287|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\n==== Some Arms by SAN SIG Arms and SIG Sauer ====\n\n* 1957 \u2014 The ''[[SIG SG 510]]'' Swiss battle rifle or ''Stgw 57'', produced to 1983. With ventilated barrel jacket, and  roller-delayed blowback, as used on Spanish [[CETME Model 58]] and German [[Heckler & Koch G3|H&K G3]] rifles.\n* 1950s-60s \u2014 The ''[[SIG 710]]'', general purpose machine gun design based on German [[MG 42]], offered in different calibres.\n* 1977 \u2014 The '''[[SIG Sauer P220|SIG P220]]''' handgun for Swiss military and police, to replace the 'P210'.

On right side of the slide are the words \"SIG Sauer System\".

Their railway tech division was sold in 1995 to [[Fiat Ferroviaria]], automation solutions and arms branches in 2000. Packaging technology is SIG's main business activity today. \n\nIn the late 1990s the Swiss arms industry as a whole faced a period of thorough restructuring. In the autumn of 2000 the firearms divisions of 'SIG', including their arms brand ''SIG Sauer'', were sold to the '''L\u00fcke & Ortmeier Gruppe'''.

By 1938 about 1,450 employees are working for the company. With beginning of World War 2 Sauer & Sohn is manufacturing more military firearms again, after 1941 production serves the war effort almost exclusively. Next to [[Mauser]] the company 'Sauer & Sohn' is becoming one of the most important manufacturers of the German standard rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]]. Among the better known is the [[M30 Luftwaffe drilling]], a survival gun for air crews. Meanwhile the 'Maschinenkarabiner 42' (MKb 42) is developed by ''C.&nbsp;G. Haenel'' in the Suhl, and a competing model by ''Walther''. It will become the 'Maschinenpistole 43' (MP 43) and later the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] This weapon is manufactured in numbers by Sauer and other companies. Production will continue after the war for newly formed armed forces, e.g. the [[Volkspolizei]] of [[East Germany]] (DDR or GDR).\n\n==== Sauer Modell 38H Pistol====\n\n[[File:Smolensk-War-Museum-16.jpg|thumb|Modell 38H, Smolensk War Museum.]]\nOf particular note is the company's ''[[Sauer 38H]]'', the first mass-produced semi-automatic pistol to feature a cocking/de-cocking lever. It was a very advanced pocket pistol design made in .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP. It was adopted as German alternate standard as 'Modell 38' and was widely used by air and tank forces. Full length is 158.75mm, barrel length is 84 2/3mm, mass is 737.088g with a magazine capacity of eight. The action has a cocker/de-cocker lever that can control the concealed hammer.

In April 1945 the U.S. Army arrives in Suhl, in early July the area is ceded to the Soviets. The company assets were seized without compensation end of October. This is confirmed by Communists in 1948, Rolf Sauer will move to West Germany.<ref name=\"GermanHuntingGuns-GunMakers&DealersP-T\" /> Hans Sauer is deported by the Soviet occupational government and never heard from again, he probably dies in 1946. The machinery, as happened with most of the industrial companies that had been located in East Germany, was mostly dismantled and moved East. Beginning 1946 to 1948, formerly independent companies in East Germany, or what was left of them, were restructured and finally merged into industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s.<ref name=\"VEB-Th\u00e4lmann\">{{Cite web|url=http://deutsches-jagd-lexikon.de/index.php?title=VEB_Fahrzeug-_und_Jagdwaffenwerk_%22Ernst_Th%C3%A4lmann%22|title=VEB Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|accessdate=January 11, 2020}} (german)</ref>\n\nIn Suhl the original ''J.&nbsp;P.

Haenel'' (which had been renamed to ''VEB [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann|Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann]]-Werk Suhl'') is starting production again in 1948, by 1954 the ''Fortuna'' (ex Sauer & Sohn) and 'Merkel' plant parts were attached to the 'Th\u00e4lmann Works' as 'Produktionsbereiche' (PB, production areas). Now hunting weapons, later also small calibre and sporting firearms and airguns are being manufactured again. The firm ''Simson & Co.'' (renamed to ''VEB Fahrzeug und Ger\u00e4tewerk Simson Suhl''), first producing bicycles, then [[moped]]s, motorbikes and also firearms, is included to the group. The weapons manufacturing is taken over by the 'Th\u00e4lmann Works', until all companies mentioned are finally merged into the ''VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk'' \"''Ernst Th\u00e4lmann''\" in 1968.<ref name=\"VEB-Th\u00e4lmann\" />\n\nThe well-known trademarks were also still being used by East Germany, e.g. to sell products abroad, until 1970 with the companies being united, the use of the trade names 'Sauer und Sohn (Suhl)', 'Fortuna (Suhl)', 'C.&nbsp;G. Haenel (Suhl)', 'Gebr. Merkel (Suhl)', and 'Simson (Suhl)' (the latter only for weapons) were dropped.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kallmyers, Arfamann|title=J. P.

Sauer & Sohn''.<ref name=\"GermanHuntingGuns-J.P. Sauer\" /> Experienced workers from Suhl had joined, and the production of hunting firearms, and later pistols, was begun the same year. Export markets were a.o. Scandinavia and the USA, Brasil and Pakistan. The company grew bigger soon, and employed over 400 hundred people by the mid-1960s. In 1966 the ''Kompressorenfabrik Wilhelm Poppe'' in [[Kiel]] is taking over the 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn'. In 1968 'Wilhelm Poppe' merged with other companies into ''J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH'', mechanical engineering becoming a main branch of business. An independent company ''Sauer Getriebe KG'' is established in 1969 in [[Neum\u00fcnster]]. \n\nIn 1972 Rolf-Dietrich Sauer died. In 1975 'Sauer Getriebe' took over plants in Aachen and Kiel from 'Sauer Maschinenbau'<ref>[https://www.sauercompressors.com/company/sauer-compressors-group/our-corporate-history/ Our corporate history _ Sauer Compressors]</ref>, and in 1976 the 'J.&nbsp;P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau' sold their hunting arms business in Eckernf\u00f6rde to the ''[[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]]'' (SIG), a company which had developed firearms from the 1860s onwards.\n\n=== Sauer as Part of SIG ===\nSwiss law of neutrality limits the ability of firearms manufacturers to export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/ch-industry.htm|title=Swiss Arms Industry |first=John|last=Pike |website=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> Companies which wish to do so may be using a foreign partner. These restrictions prevented 'SIG' from exploiting a new design concept they had developed. The design resulted from the creation at that time of a new form of industrial production equipment, known as the \"Automatic Screw Machine\", which was introduced by the company. While 'SIG' had produced a very high quality handgun in their ''P210'' model, it was also expensive to manufacture, required machining operations at high levels of precision. This produced a firearm that was known for its accuracy, but too expensive to be sold to a wider market. \n\nSpurred by the necessity to partner with a foreign company in order to profit from their production machinery and the items it could produce 'SIG' chose the German firm of 'J.&nbsp;P.

Result was a new type of action for a locked-breech semi-automatic pistol, with a new high quality smooth operating double/single-action trigger, a safe hammer lowering device, automatic firing pin block, and easy disassembly for cleaning. This new concept handgun was named [[SIG Sauer P220]].\n\nPrior to World War II, Sauer had been primarily a maker of [[shotgun]]s and hunting [[rifle]]s. During the war they produced a new handgun, the ''Sauer 38H'', but afterwards withdraw from this market. The 'Sauer 38H' had been produced in competition with other German makers, such as 'Mauser' and 'Walther', at a time when new designs began to feature a double/single-action trigger. \nWith 'SIG' as their partner/owner, 'Sauer' returned to the business of manufacturing handguns.
