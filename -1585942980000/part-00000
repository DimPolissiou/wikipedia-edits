Created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 in April 1940 as the original and most popular incarnation of  '''[[Robin (character)|Robin]]''' . In ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|Tales of the Teen Titans]]'' #44 (July 1984) the character retires his role as Robin and assumes the superhero persona of '''[[Nightwing]]''' , created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]].\n\nThe youngest in a family of [[acrobatics|acrobats]] known as the \"[[Flying Graysons]]\", Richard watches a [[Boss (crime)|mafia boss]] named [[Tony Zucco]] kill his parents in order to [[extortion|extort]] money from the [[circus]] that employed them. After the tragic murder, [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) takes Richard (Dick) in as his [[Ward (law)|legal ward]] ([[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an adopted son in some cases) and trains him to become his crime-fighting partner Robin. He is written by many authors as the first son of Batman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=9144|title=Batman and Robin 25 Preview|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> As well as being Batman's crime-fighting partner, Dick establishes himself as the leader of the [[Teen Titans]], a team of teenage superheroes. As a young man, he retires as Robin and takes on his own superhero identity to assert his independence, becoming Nightwing. As Nightwing, he continues to lead the Teen Titans and later the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. In the first volume of his eponymous series (1996\u20132009), he becomes the protector of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], Gotham's economically troubled neighboring city, the locale the character is most closely associated with. He has also been depicted as protecting the streets of New York, Chicago, and Gotham City over the years.\n\nDick Grayson has taken on the identity of Batman on a few occasions. In the aftermath of \"[[Batman: Knightfall]]\", Grayson was not offered the role of Batman while the original was recovering from a broken back as Bruce felt that Nightwing is a hero in his own right and not Batman's understudy, but after the events of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries later that year, he replaces Bruce Wayne as '''[[Batman (Dick Grayson)| Batman]]''', beginning in ''Robin'' #0 (1994) and extending throughout the ''[[Batman: Prodigal]]'' storyline in 1995. Dick again assumes the mantle following the events of \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\" (2008) and ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008\u20132009). As Batman, Dick moves to [[Gotham City]] following his mentor's apparent death and partners with the fifth Robin, [[Damian Wayne]]. On Bruce's return, both men maintained the Batman identity until 2011, when Dick returned to the Nightwing identity with DC's [[The New 52]] continuity reboot. In a 2014 comic story, Dick is forced to abandon the Nightwing identity after being unmasked on TV and faking his death, setting up [[Tim Seeley]]'s ''Grayson'' comic book, Dick becomes '''Agent 37''', Batman's mole in the nefarious spy organization Spyral. Following the conclusion of the ''Grayson'' series, and the restoration of his secret identity in the series' final issue,<ref name=\"Issue 20\">''Grayson'' vol. 1, #20</ref> Dick returns to being Nightwing as part of the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch in 2016.\n\nDick Grayson has appeared as Robin (Batman's sidekick) in several other media adaptations: [[Batman (serial)|the 1943 serial]] played by [[Douglas Croft]], [[Batman and Robin (serial)|the 1949 serial]] played by [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]], the 1966\u20131968 live action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and its [[Batman (1966 film)|motion picture]] portrayed by [[Burt Ward]], played by [[Chris O'Donnell]] in the 1995 film ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and its 1997 sequel ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. Dick Grayson appears in the ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' television series for the new DC streaming service played by [[Brenton Thwaites]]. [[Loren Lester]] voiced the character Robin in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and later as Nightwing's first screen adaptation in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', and Batman's accidentally adopted son in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. In May 2011, [[IGN]] ranked Dick Grayson #11 on their list of the \"Top 100 Super Heroes of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/11 |title=Dick Grayson (Robin) \u2013 #11 Top Comic Book Heroes |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> In 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Grayson as Nightwing as #1 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=2015-10-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Publication history of Dick Grayson}}\n\n===Robin the Boy Wonder===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | image2 = Detective Comics 38.jpg | caption2 = Dick Grayson as Robin in his first appearance, on the cover of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940), along with Batman.

Robin's debut was an effort to get younger readers to enjoy Batman. The name \"Robin, The Boy Wonder\" and the medieval look of the original costume are inspired by the legendary hero [[Robin Hood]]. The costume was designed by [[Jerry Robinson]] who drew it from memory based on Robin Hood illustrations by [[N. C. Wyeth]].<ref name=\"ComicsJournal271\">[[Groth, Gary]] (November 2005). \"Jerry Robinson: Been There, Done That\". ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #271</ref>{{Rp|83}}\n\nIn his first appearance, Dick Grayson is a circus acrobat, and, with his parents, one of the \"[[Flying Graysons]]\". Robin was born on the first day of spring, son of John Grayson and Mary Grayson, a young aerialist couple. While preparing for a performance, Dick overhears two gangsters attempting to extort [[protection money]] from the circus owner. The owner refuses, so the gangsters sabotage the trapeze wires with acid. During the next performance, the trapeze from which Dick's parents are swinging snaps, sending them to their deaths. Before he can go to the police, Batman appears to him and warns him that the two gangsters work for [[Tony Zucco]], a very powerful crime boss, and that revealing his knowledge could lead to his death. When Batman recounts the murder of his [[Thomas Wayne|own]] [[Martha Wayne|parents]], Dick asks to become his aide. After extensive training, Dick becomes Robin. They start by disrupting Zucco's gambling and extortion rackets. They then successfully bait the riled Zucco into visiting a construction site, where they capture him.\n\nRobin's origin has a thematic connection to Batman's in that both see their parents killed by criminals, creating an urge to battle the criminal element. Bruce sees a chance to direct the anger and rage that Dick feels in a way that he himself cannot, thus creating a father/son bond and understanding between the two. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, DC Comics portrayed Batman and Robin as a team, deeming them the \"Dynamic Duo\", rarely publishing a ''Batman'' story without his sidekick; stories entirely devoted to Robin appeared in ''[[Star-Spangled Comics]]'' from 1947 through 1952.\n\nThe character history of the [[Earth-Two]] Robin accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1940s and 1950s, while the adventures of the mainstream [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (who lived on \"[[Earth-One]]\") begin later in time and with certain elements of his origin retold. Both were depicted as separate, though parallel, individuals living in their respective universes, with the \"older\" Earth-Two character eventually reaching death in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\n===Teen Titans===\n[[File:Tales of the Teen Titans 44.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson's debut as Nightwing; from ''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #44 (July 1984)]]\n1964's ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #54 introduces a junior version of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. This team is led by the modern-day Robin, residing on Earth-One, and was joined by two other teenage sidekicks, [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] (sidekick of [[Aquaman]]) and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] (sidekick of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]), to stop the menace of Mr. Twister.\n\nLater, the three sidekicks join forces with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] in order to free their mentors in the [[Justice League|JLA]] from mind-controlled thrall. They decide to become a real team: the [[Teen Titans]]. By virtue of the tactical skills gleaned from Batman, Robin is swiftly recognized as leader before the Titans disband some years later.\n\nIn 1969, still in the Pre-''Crisis'' continuity, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] return Batman to his darker roots. One part of this effort is writing Robin out of the series by sending Dick Grayson to [[Hudson University]] and into a separate strip in the back of ''Detective Comics''. The by-now Teen Wonder appears only sporadically in ''Batman'' stories of the 1970s as well as in a short-lived revival of ''The Teen Titans''.\n\nIn 1980, Grayson once again takes up the role of leader of the Teen Titans, now featured in the monthly series ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', which became one of DC Comics's most beloved series of the era. During his leadership of the Titans, however, he had a falling out with Batman, leading to an estrangement that would last for many years.\n\n===Nightwing===\nIn the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' continuity, the maturing Dick Grayson grows weary of his role as Batman's young sidekick. He renames himself [[Nightwing]], recalling his adventure in the [[Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], where he and Batman meet the local hero of the same name. He maintains this identity during his role in the Teen Titans, and occasionally returns to assist Batman and his successors as Robin in the form of Jason Todd and Tim Drake, Tim in particular becoming a younger brother figure to him.\n\nWhen Bruce's back is broken by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] during the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' story arc, Bruce selects [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] as his replacement as Batman as he does not want to burden Dick with the role and fears that Dick may go after Bane in revenge. However, when Valley proves to be too unstable to be Batman, Bruce undergoes a rigorous recovery and training program with the aid of Doctor [[Shondra Kinsolving]] and [[Lady Shiva]] to restore him to full health, defeating Valley with Dick and Tim's aid. However, feeling that he needs to re-evaluate Batman and his mission after Valley's defeat, Bruce leaves Gotham once again, after appointing Dick as his successor during the \"Prodigal\" story arc. While acting as Batman, Dick is left with a clearer idea of the psychological stresses Bruce must endure in the role, as well as facing some of Bruce's newer enemies \u2014 such as Killer Croc, the Ventriloquist and the Ratcatcher \u2014 while settling his own long-standing issues with Two-Face.\n\n====Miniseries and afterward====\nIn ''Nightwing: Alfred's Return'' #1 (1995), Dick Grayson travels to [[England]] to find [[Alfred Pennyworth]] who had resigned from Bruce Wayne's service following the events of the ''KnightSaga''. Before returning to Gotham City together, they prevent an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the British government that involves destroying the [[Channel Tunnel]] under the [[English Channel]].\n\nLater on, with the ''Nightwing'' miniseries (September to December 1995, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] with [[Greg Land]] as artist), Dick briefly considers retiring from being Nightwing forever before family papers uncovered by Alfred reveal a possible link between the murder of the Flying Graysons and the Crown Prince of Kravia. Journeying to Kravia, Nightwing helps to topple the murderous Kravian leader and prevent an ethnic cleansing, while learning his parents' true connection to the Prince; they witnessed the original Prince being killed and replaced with an impostor who became as bad as his predecessor (although Zucco killed the Graysons before the conspirators could do anything about it). In the aftermath, Dick returns to his role as Nightwing, recognizing that, for all his problems with Bruce, Bruce never ''made'' him become Robin or join his crusade, accepting that he imitated Bruce's example because Bruce was worthy of imitation.\n\nIn 1996, following the success of the miniseries, DC Comics launched a monthly solo series featuring Nightwing (written by [[Chuck Dixon]], with art by [[Scott McDaniel]]), in which he patrols Gotham City's neighboring municipality of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], relocating there to investigate a series of murders and remaining as he recognized that the city needed protection. He remains the city's guardian for some time, facing foes such as [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] and new villains such as [[Torque (DC Comics)|Torque]], and even becomes a police officer so that he can make an impact on the city's criminal activity in both parts of his life. Later, Grayson divides his duties between Bludhaven and Gotham after [[Batman: Cataclysm|a devastating earthquake]] and the subsequent decision to declare Gotham a [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]], Grayson occasionally assisting his mentor and other members of Bat-Family in maintaining and restoring order in Gotham until it is fully rebuilt. When the Justice League vanished into the past fighting ancient sorceress [[Gamemnae]], Nightwing was selected as the leader of the reserve League created by an emergency program Batman had established in the event of his League being defeated, Batman describing Nightwing as the only person he could have picked to lead the new team.\n\nEventually, the original League are restored, and Nightwing departs along with some of his League-although others remain as some of the original team take a leave of absence-although Batman notes that his leadership of the League proves that he is ready for more responsibilities. However, the death of Blockbuster prompts Nightwing to leave Bludhaven due to his crisis of conscience; Blockbuster was killed by vigilante [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]] and Nightwing did not stop it even when he had the chance to do so. While Nightwing returns to Gotham to heal after assisting Batman in dealing with a series of gang wars, Bl\u00fcdhaven is destroyed by the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] when they drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] on it.\n\nDuring the battle of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Grayson suffers a near-fatal injury from [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] when he shields Wayne from Luthor's attack.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7 (2006)</ref> Originally, the editors at DC intended to have Grayson killed in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as [[Newsarama]] revealed from the DC Panel at WizardWorld Philadelphia:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |title=WizardWorld Philadelphia: DCU panel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125311/http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{bquote|It was again explained that Nightwing was originally intended to die in ''Infinite Crisis'', and that you can see the arc that was supposed to end with his death in the series. After long discussions, the death edict was finally reversed, but the decision was made that, if they were going to be keeping him, he would have to be changed. The next arc of the ongoing series will further explain the changes, it was said.}}\n\nAfter spending some time away with Bruce and Tim to heal and rebuild after their harsh times prior to the Crisis, Dick relocates to New York, but has trouble finding work as both Dick Grayson and Nightwing. During the ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' storyline, Nightwing is ambushed by the International Club of Villains. He is later seen being held in [[Arkham Asylum]], where one of the surgeons, in reality also the civilian identity of ICoV member Le Bossu, arranged for Nightwing to be admitted under the name of Pierrot Lunaire (another ICoV member) and be kept both heavily drugged and regularly beaten by staff to subdue him. Scheduled for an experimental [[lobotomy]] by Le Bossu himself, he manages to free himself and come to Batman's aid for the finale of the story arc.\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\nFollowing the events of Batman's apparent death during the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Nightwing has closed down shop in New York so as to return to Gotham, where after the events of \"[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]\", he assumes the identity of Batman, with [[Damian Wayne]], Bruce Wayne's biological son, as the new Robin.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1\u20133</ref>\n\nThe new team of Batman and Robin is the focus of Grant Morrison and [[Frank Quitely]]'s ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=11864 |title=Batman & Robin #1 |website=DCComics.com |accessdate=28 April 2015 |quote=reunited team of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely....

Over time, Dick's experience as the Dark Knight would harden his personality as his mentor.\n\nDuring this period, Dick Grayson as Batman also features as a member of the [[Justice League]] in a short-lived run by writer [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]]. After an intense confrontation with the Club of Villains and the mysterious Doctor Simon Hurt (who has established fake evidence that he is actually Bruce's father [[Thomas Wayne]]), Hurt is defeated when Bruce returns to the present. However, Bruce leaves Dick to continue to act as Batman in Gotham with Damian as his partner while he sets up the new 'Batman Incorporated' program, Bruce publicly identifying himself as Batman's financial backer to justify a global Batman-themed operation where he funds multiple other vigilantes.\n\n===''The New 52'' (2011\u20132016)===\n{{See also|The New 52}}\nDick Grayson is re-established as Nightwing following DC's ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crossover event, after which the publisher relaunched all of its titles and made alterations to its continuity as part of an initiative called [[The New 52]]. In the new status quo, Bruce Wayne is once again the only Batman, and Dick, like the other members of the adoptive family, is a few years younger. Dick, despite being 19 is drawn a bit shorter than in his pre-relaunch frame. This is likely due to adding believability to his acrobat past.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.comicvine.com/news/whats-changed-and-whats-the-same-in-batman-1-spoilers/143603/ |title=What's Changed and What's the Same in Batman #1?

Art by Doug Mahnke and Patrick Gleason]]\nIn his civilian identity he is attacked by an assassin named Saiko who insists that he is the fiercest killer in Gotham.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> The series ''[[Batman Incorporated]]'' relaunches with a second volume, continuing its story while taking into account the New 52's continuity changes; Dick is now depicted as Nightwing, and not as Batman, but the change is not addressed in the comic itself. In ''Nightwing'', Dick inherits the deed to the circus from a dying C. C. Haly and begins a relationship with his childhood friend acrobat Raya Vestri. Saiko tortures Haly for information on Nightwing's secret identity, and the old man dies in Dick's arms after telling him the circus holds a terrible secret.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #2</ref> Investigating leads, he tracks down a supervillain named Feedback, who used to be a childhood friend, but does not learn anything.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #3</ref> Following Haly's clues, he finds a mysterious Book of Names in the circus that has his name on the last page.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #4</ref> Later the circus announces they will be doing a memorial show on the anniversary of the night Dick's parents were murdered, and Saiko attacks by detonating a massive explosion.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #6</ref>\n\nIt is then revealed that the circus has been training assassins for years, and Saiko was a childhood friend using Raya as an accomplice. Grayson had been selected to become a new Talon for the Court of Owls, but when Batman adopted him, Saiko took his place. The killer plummets to his death and Raya turns herself in. Returning to the Batcave, Bruce reveals to Dick that the current Talon is his great-grandfather William Cobb.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #7</ref> During the [[Night of the Owls]] event Dick faces Cobb, who was revived while protecting Mayor Hady.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #8\u20139</ref> Following the event, Dick decided to keep Haly's Circus in Gotham and plans to invest in turning an abandoned amusement park into their new location without Bruce's money.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #10</ref> He works with Sonia Branch, the daughter of Tony Zucco, the crime boss who murdered Dick's parents, into getting a loan for this plan by investing his entire trust fund despite being a high-risk due to Saiko's recent attack. The problems arise because of the guilt Sonia feels towards her father's actions <ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #11\u201312</ref> and many members of the circus are afraid for their lives because of the previous disasters and accuse Dick Grayson of being a flake, making it hard for those who choose to stay.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #13</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Death of the Family]]\" crossover event across the ''Batman''-related comic books led to a major shift in Nightwing's status quo. During the storyline, one of Dick's friends Jimmy Clark, who worked as a circus clown, was murdered by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] because Joker felt like Jimmy was a knockoff of him. Nightwing later discovers Joker broke Raya out of prison, infected her with his Joker venom and has forced her to fight him while wearing a makeshift Nightwing costume. The toxin eventually killed Raya, though Nightwing tried in vain with an anti-toxin to save her. Nightwing then discovered that Joker left a message on Raya's abdomen that he was targeting Haly's Circus next.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #15</ref> However upon arriving there, Joker unveils his plan to burn the circus to the ground and then infects Nightwing with his gas that not only causes him to experience hallucinations of Jimmy and Raya, but he is soon attacked by the other members of Haly's Circus that were also affected by the toxin allowing Joker to capture him.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #16</ref>\n\n[[File:NightwingNew52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nightwing as he appears in the New 52. Art by Brett Booth.]]\nIn the aftermath, Haly's Circus is gone, with Dick broke as a result for having lost his investment. While the other circus members survived since Joker used a different Joker venom on them, they blame Dick and decide to leave after Raya and Jimmy's funeral, though deep down they know it is not his fault. Dick becomes bitter from his loss. After he used excessive force to bring down some criminals that tried to plunder valuables from the remains of the circus, Damian, having been monitoring him, is able to talk some sense into Nightwing, which helps him recover.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #17</ref>\n\nNightwing is later deeply affected by the death of Damian following his murder at the hands of Damian's clone, the Heretic, in ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. With Damian's death and potential resurrection becoming an obsession of Batman's, Dick is shunned by Bruce when he tries to tell him to move on, in ''Batman and Nightwing'' (a retitled ''Batman & Robin'' #23).\n\nLater, the ''Nightwing'' series changes its setting to Chicago, Illinois. Sonia Branch reveals to Dick an e-mail that indicates that her father Zucco is still alive. After giving the address to [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] to try and track down who sent it, Robin uncovers that Zucco is residing in Chicago. Nightwing moves to Chicago in order to find and arrest Zucco, who is now living under the assumed identity of Billy Lester, an assistant to the mayor. Soon after arriving in Chicago, Dick meets his new roommates, a photojournalist named Michael and a computer specialist named Joey. After leaving the apartment to meet with Johnny Spade, a borderline criminal who steals and sells information, their meeting is interrupted by the police. A short chase results in the accidental destruction of a newly rebuilt subway. Meanwhile, a criminal hacker called the Prankster tortures, maims and kills criminal [[Confidence trick|con men]] who are untouchable by the police.\n\nThe Chicago story is later abruptly ended by Nightwing's role in a larger company-wide crossover event. After the Crime Syndicate invade Earth Prime at the conclusion of the \"[[Trinity War]]\" ''Justice League'' storyline and defeat the Justice League, the DC crossover story ''[[Forever Evil]]'' depicts Nightwing's capture by the [[Crime Syndicate]], who expose his secret identity to the world. Following their escape from the Syndicate, Batman and [[Catwoman]] decide to rescue him. He then is invited by [[Owlman (DC Comics)|Owlman]] to help defeat the Crime Syndicate, which he accepts. Nightwing is severely beaten by [[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]] and is attached to a device from a parallel world known as the Murder Machine, which is controlled by his heart rate and is reportedly impossible to escape from alive. When Batman and [[Lex Luthor]] arrive to free him, Lex stops his heart in order to fool the system so he can disarm it. However, Batman, enraged over what Lex has done, attacks him. Luthor explains it is not too late to save Grayson.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> In an uncharacteristically heroic moment, Luthor injects Grayson's heart with adrenaline, which successfully revives Grayson.

However, Dick serves as a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] under Batman due to their agenda of unmasking heroes by collecting the Paragon organs, organs in which contains the [[DNA]] of the Justice League and bestows meta-bioweapons the ability to use their powers. He assists Spyral's agenda to know more about Minos and his endgame, resulting in Spyral attaining most of the scattered organs. In a later story arc, Minos betrays Spyral and attempts to leak its secrets.

Mother intends to trigger a global collapse with the reasoning that the survivors will rebuild a stronger world after being broken by tragedy and without the hindrance of parents to force their ideals on them, but Grayson and the rest of the Family are able to defeat her, Dick affirming that Batman helps the Robins become their own people who can avoid the mistakes he made in dealing with his own trauma rather than Mother's belief that she and Batman each teach people to use their trauma to define themselves. At the conclusion of the storyline, Dick meets with the restored Batman, assuring Bruce that, unlike Mother, he never forced his ideals on them, but simply gave them all an example that they chose to emulate while avoiding following it so exactly that they became like him.\n\nWhen the [[Court of Owls]] plant a bomb inside Damian Wayne, they are able to blackmail Dick into officially joining their organization, although all sides are aware that Grayson intends to try and use his new position against them.<ref>''Robin War'' #1\u20132</ref> The ''Grayson'' series ended at issue #20, where in the final issue, it was revealed that all knowledge of Dick's identity was erased from most of the world with one of Spyral's satellites, allowing Dick to resume his superhero activities as Nightwing once again.<ref name=\"Issue 20\"/>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\n[[File:Nightwing v4 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Nightwing]] as he appears on the cover of ''Nightwing'', vol. 4 #4 (November 2016).

Raptor reveals that he grew up in the circus as a child and fell in love with Dick's mother, Mary, as they stole from the rich and powerful in Paris. Raptor watched over Dick in the shadows as he grew up, and developed a hatred for Bruce Wayne as he represented everything he and Mary were against and felt it was dishonoring her memory to have Dick raised by him.

Art by Eddy Barrows.]]\nDick Grayson is a prodigious natural athlete, expert acrobat, and aerialist possessing a peak level of agility and [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] skills. At a very young age, he trained in acrobats as a stage performer with his parents, and he is regarded as the greatest acrobat in the DC Universe. He is the only human on Earth who can do the quadruple [[somersault]] (formerly one of three, the other two being his parents). Grayson is trained in several [[martial arts]] disciplines and was rigorously trained by his mentor, Batman, in various skills, such as [[escapology]], [[criminology]], [[fencing]], stealth, [[disguise]], and numerous other combat/non-combat disciplines. Dick Grayson is 5' 10\" (1.78&nbsp;m) and 175&nbsp;lbs (79&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Nightwing: Secret Files and Origins\">''Nightwing: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (October 1999)</ref> He is shown to have natural skill in reading the body motion of others<ref>''Nightwing'' vol. 2 #0</ref> like that of [[Cassandra Cain]] and [[Lady Shiva]] as shown in the previous continuity. He is able to anticipate and predict one's next action and detect if someone is lying. Like Batman, he also possesses a will strong enough to withstand even telepathic attacks.<ref>''Grayson'' vol. 1 #8 (May 2015)</ref> He is also a master of [[espionage]], his skills even further shown as a spy within the tremendously powerful intelligence organization Spyral.\n\nAs Nightwing, Grayson is a master in various forms of unarmed combat, such as [[Aikido]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Eskrima]], [[Capoeira]], [[Judo]], [[Hapkido]], [[Taekwondo]], [[Jiu-jitsu]], [[Karate]], [[Jeet Kune Do]], [[Savate]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Ninjitsu]], and [[Boxing]] and is armed with twin Eskrima sticks made from an unbreakable polymer. He also carries several dozen modified [[batarang]]s (called wing-dings) along with de-cel jumplines and gas capsules.<ref name=\"Nightwing: Secret Files and Origins\"/>\n\nHaving had the finest education as Bruce Wayne's [[Ward (law)|ward]], he is fluent in Spanish, Russian, Mandarin, Cantonese, the alien language of Tamaran, conversant in [[American Sign Language]],<ref>''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #44 (July 1984)</ref> [[French language|French]],<ref>''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #14 (April 2001)</ref> [[Italian language|Italian]],<ref>''Nightwing'' vol. 2 #72 (October 2002)</ref> [[Persian language|Persian]],<ref>''Robin'' vol. 2 #175 (August 2008)</ref> and [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]].<ref>''The Power Company: Manhunter'' #1 (March 2002)</ref> He is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with [[superlative]] leadership skills, having served as leader to the [[Teen Titans|Titans]], the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and even the [[Justice League]]. Additionally, Dick's interpersonal skills and efforts to remain in contact with other heroes makes him a master at rallying, unifying, and inspiring the superhero community, a skill in which he has surpassed his mentor;<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #3 (February 2006)</ref> when the pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman received the praise of the New 52 Nightwing, Superman noted that, in any reality, it is high praise to be vouched for by Dick Grayson.\n\nBesides his resources as Bruce Wayne's adopted son and heir, Dick's parents also left him a trust fund which [[Lucius Fox]] turned into a small fortune. Although it is not comparable to Bruce Wayne's wealth, it has been enough to maintain his Nightwing equipment, purchase the rights to Haly's Circus (saving Dick's former home from financial troubles),<ref>\"Nightwing Vol. 2\" #6</ref> and secretly buy his former Bl\u00fcdhaven apartment building at 1013 Parkthorne Avenue.<ref>\"Nightwing\" Vol. 1 #13</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nDick Grayson's Robin costume alluded to the [[American robin]] and [[Robin Hood]]. The cape was alternately depicted as yellow or green. The costume also featured [[crakow (shoe)|crakow-style shoes]], which some artists would discard from the portrayal.\n\n[[File:Nightwing (Dick Grayson circa 1995).png|thumb|right|[[Nightwing]]'s iconic blue and black costume as it debuts on the interior art of ''Nightwing'' (vol. 1) #2 (September 1995). Art by [[Greg Land]].]]\nDick Grayson's Nightwing costume was made of a version of the [[Nomex]] fire-resistant, triple-weave [[Kevlar]]-lined material. It was an excellent protection against damage, and was also insulated against electricity. Specifically tailored to his style of fighting, Nightwing's costume had fewer body-armor inlays than Batman, anticipating a decreased need for shock absorption and an increased capacity for motion. Against opponents both fast and strong, Nightwing had supplemental body-armor overlays he could attach to his gauntlets, boots, shoulders, and mask. Instead of a black cape to keep him hidden, which Grayson dislikes wearing,<ref name=\"Batman 688\">''Batman'' #688</ref><ref name=\"Batman and Robin #2\">''Batman and Robin'' #2</ref> the suit was light sensitive, darkening when there was more light in the area. The mask, in the form of his symbol, was fixed in place with [[spirit gum]], and included a built-in [[radio]] transmitter/receiver and Starlite [[night vision]] lenses. The third costume, with its stylized blue \"wing\" across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers, over a black bodysuit, made its first appearance in ''Nightwing: Ties That Bind'' #2 (October 1995), and was designed by the cover artist Brian Stelfreeze. His suit was also equipped with wings that allow him to glide.\n\nAs Batman, his [[Batsuit]] featured a lighter cape to accommodate his more acrobatic fighting style<ref name=\"Batman 688\"/> and a [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]] with a bat-shaped buckle.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #1\">''Batman and Robin'' #1</ref> He also developed \"para-capes\" for his and Damian's costumes which gave them the ability to glide.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #1\"/> Grayson is noticeably shorter than Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #2\"/>\n\nPost-Flashpoint with his return to Nightwing, Dick wore a similar suit, albeit with the blue \"wing\" being red throughout the New 52. Previously in the New 52's continuity as Nightwing, he formerly owned an armored suit which was blue and yellow, resembling a modern take of his previous first costume in the previous continuity and another that was an armored suit that sported a red bat symbol, in which is currently being used by [[Jason Todd]] though slightly modified for Jason's taste.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' (vol. 1) #6</ref> Formerly before having to leave the Nightwing mantle post ''Forever Evil'', his suit was made up of sturdy but flexible material that not only suited his strength in speed and acrobatics, but also was durable enough to take bullets from machine guns. His former costume was a stylized red \"wing\" across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers, over a black torso and legs. He also has gauntlets much like Batman's own suit. Nightwing's costume is tailored specifically to his unique style of crime-fighting. He also has variants of his costume in which one of his stylized red \"wings\" reach only to his shoulders, another to his wrists, and one in which has hip and finger stripes.\n\nSome versions of Dick's story as Nightwing do not make clear whether the public at large knows that the first Robin is now Nightwing, or whether he is simply an entirely new hero. A [[metafiction]]al foreword (said to have been made by a future historian) to a trade paperback for \"A Death In The Family\" made the claim that the public at large always thought there was just one Robin. In versions that do address it, Dick and Bruce seem to want to spread the belief that Nightwing started his career as an adult, the better to hide their true identities. The series ''Grayson'' seems to indicate that the public does not know, as Midnighter did not think to study Robin's techniques in preparation for his fight with Grayson, an advantage the latter exploited.<ref>\"Grayson\" #6</ref>\n\nDuring his time as Agent 37 for Spyral, Dick uses identity protection implants that ensure that neither cameras nor the memory of e.g. target persons can capture his face. He also was incorporated with a pair hypnotic contacts which Dick used to mind control someone if they looked directly into his eye. Additionally he still carries a pair of Escrima Sticks. He was required to carry a gun as part of Spyral protocol.<ref>\"Grayson\" #1</ref>\n\nStarting with Rebirth, Dick returns to being Nightwing, once again in black and blue. The \"wing\" is replaced by a thinner, v-shaped bird that starts and the chest and goes up to the shoulders and around to the back. His domino mask is now blue, instead of black. The shins and calves of his legs feature a big \"swish\" of blue. He wears a black leather strap and buckle on each of his forearms. The intention of this redesign is to harken back to the iconic black and blue look of the third Nightwing costume introduced in 1995, maintain the simplicity of the aforementioned iconic look, creating a more visible bird symbol, while also highlighting Dick's face with a lighter coloured mask and his legs which can allow for more dynamic art when he is in motion.<ref>Nightwing: Rebirth #1</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the Amalgam Universe, Dick was combined with the Marvel character [[Moon Knight]] and became '''Moonwing'''. He was a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent who selected Jason Todd as his successor when he temporarily left S.H.I.E.L.D. to attend college. As Moonwing, Jason made a careless mistake, which resulted in a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's death, causing him to be dismissed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Jason became furious and blamed his mentors. He was then caught in an explosion when the villain Hyena detonated a bomb intended to kill Director Bruce Wayne and the [[Wolverine (character)|Dark Claw]]. Despite his body never being recovered, S.H.I.E.L.D. presumed he was dead, but he survived and his body was recovered by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], who replaced his damaged body parts with robotic parts, transforming him into [[Deathlok]]. He then participated in a coup to help [[Catwoman|Madame Cat]] overthrow the Supreme Leader of Hydra, [[Lex Luthor]] a.k.a. the Green Skull. Afterwards, he swore allegiance to her. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents launched an attack on HYDRA's base, Deathlok was sent to confront them, where he spotted his former mentor, Moonwing, and attacked him from behind. He then revealed that he has been waiting a long time to kill both Dick and Bruce. He then unmasked Moonwing and accused him and Bruce of abandoning him. He then began strangling Dick, but before he could kill him Colonel [[Nick Fury]] and [[Sgt. Rock|Sergeant Joe Rock]] commandeered an aircraft and shot Deathlok several times in the back. Despite feeling sorry for Jason, Dick left Jason to die again so he could continue the attack on the HYDRA base.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1</ref>\n\n===''Kingdom Come'' (Post-''Infinite Crisis'' Earth 22)===\n[[File:Red Robin (Kingdom Come).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson as an alternate version of Red Robin in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''.

He also has a daughter, [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] (Mar'i Grayson), whom he fathered with Starfire. Nightstar aligns herself with Batman's Outsiders and romantically involves with his and Talia al Ghul's son, Ibn al Xu'ffasch. After Ibn and Mar'i marries, they have a daughter and son, and thus Dick and Bruce Wayne become in-laws and grandfathers of their respective progenies' children. Dick and Bruce reconcile at the end of the story.\n\n===''JLA: The Nail'' and ''JLA: Another Nail''===\nIn the Elseworlds mini-series ''[[JLA: The Nail]],'' Dick Grayson (as Robin), along with [[Barbara Gordon]] (as Batgirl), are tortured to death by the Joker with his [[Kryptonian]] gauntlets, driving Batman temporarily insane after he witnesses their ordeals and demise. The grief-stricken hero then kills the Joker for revenge. Later, in the sequel ''[[JLA: Another Nail]],'' Dick returns as a spirit after the Joker escapes from Hell. He helps Batman defeat the villain once and for all, and seeing Dick is at peace after his death gives Batman the strength to move on.\n\n===''Batman Beyond''===\nThe 2010 comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' features [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] facing a new incarnation of [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. After ruling out Tim Drake as a suspect, Terry questions Dick Grayson who now runs an athletics training course after retiring as Nightwing due to sustaining severe gunshot wounds (including the loss of an eye) in a battle between the Joker and Batman.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (October 2010)</ref> Though Dick gives an alibi, Hush later incapacitates Terry and removes his bandages to reveal the face of a youthful version of Dick with both eyes intact.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #4 (November 2010)</ref> It is later revealed that Hush is actually a clone of Grayson, created by [[Project Cadmus]] under the guidance of [[Amanda Waller]] in order to ensure that the world will always have a Batman.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #5 (November 2010)</ref> Hush later dies during a final confrontation with Terry, the real Dick Grayson, and a new [[Catwoman#Other versions|Catwoman]], after they thwart the villain's plan to destroy Gotham. He is told over the comlink with Bruce that he is still his heir but Dick rips off the connection still too hurt to talk to Bruce.\n\nDick later serves as a supporting character for the ongoing series. When a GCPD detective discovers Dick's past as Nightwing due to Hush's recent actions, Terry and Maxine \"Max\" Gibson attempt to convince the public otherwise by having Terry masquerade as his former identity while Max plants numerous false alibis for Dick throughout the internet. In the end, Dick partially admits the truth to Gotham without jeopardizing his allies' secrets, claiming he was a paid agent of ''Batman Inc.'', as the new Batman. The detective who threatened to expose Dick still plans to sue Dick but is \"persuaded\" not to by Terry.\n\nIt is revealed that, after the events in the ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' flashbacks and after what happened to Tim, Barbara gave up her Batgirl identity and broke off her relationship with Bruce, which Dick never knew about. Barbara resumed her relationship with Dick but was hesitant to confess to him that she had dated Bruce. Dick planned to propose to Barbara. Bruce himself ultimately confessed to their relationship after finding out that he had gotten Barbara pregnant; furthermore, he wanted to be involved in the life of their child. Barbara, however, unable to leave behind her vigilante life, fought a mugger and ultimately miscarried her child. These events, as well as her sense that she destroyed the bond between Dick and Bruce, caused Barbara's relationship with Dick to disintegrate and eventually led her to marry Sam Young. Losing Barbara caused Dick to become estranged from Bruce for his role. Later on, when Terry learns Bruce's impact on the former couple, he then sides with Grayson. In the parallel universe where the [[Justice Lords]] reside, Dick's counterpart is happily married to Barbara's and they had a son named after his father, John Grayson, together. Bruce's Justice Lord counterpart was happily married to [[Wonder Woman]] as well until her Justice Lord counterpart killed him. The events in the Justice Lords' world cause Dick envying of the life his counterpart leads with his wife. Terry also becomes friends with Dick's counterpart, helping him training his own into the new Batman in Justice Lords' world.\n\nIn the 2013 Digital Comic Batman Beyond 2.0 it is revealed that Terry has now left Bruce's employment since leaving high school and is now working for Grayson as Batman with Dick taking on the role of support for Terry. While Terry finds working with Dick easier than Bruce, Dick reminds Terry of his commitment to his family and to his education.\n\nIn the rebooted ''Batman Beyond'' timeline that takes place after ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'', Dick is now the mayor of Bl\u00fcdhaven and has both eyes intact. He also has a daughter named Elainna, who became the new Batwoman in the \"First Flight\" storyline.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' Vol. 7 #37-40.</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Dick Grayson and his parents are part of the Haley Circus acrobats, featured in a show alongside [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Boston Brand]]. In a vision that [[Doctor Fate]] gives Boston Brand, Boston is standing over Dick's body. Before the next show, Boston tries to convince Dick to perform solo. However, Dick tells him that family means too much to him. Dick poses the question that Boston's seeming fearlessness could stem from his insecurity of being alone.<ref>''[[Deadman and the Flying Graysons|Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons]]'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> During the attack on Haley Circus by the Amazons, Dick's mother falls to the ground in the ensuing madness.

He is later reunited with John, who in turn becomes the new Robin of Earth 2. Later, Dick becomes wheelchair bound and adopts a new alias as Oracle while [[Helena Wayne]] becomes the fourth Batman with John fighting by her side as her Robin.\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the alternate world of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)|Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Dick remains firmly aligned with Batman's views of law and order even as Superman begins a more forceful approach of ending crime. When he announces his plan to take away the inhabitants of Arkham Asylum, Dick joins Batman in going to stop him. Batman's biological son Damian, however, believes in Superman's cause and sides with him. During a skirmish at the asylum Damian inadvertently kills Dick by throwing his kali stick at him, causing Dick to fall over and break his neck when he lands on a rock positioned in just the wrong location. After this action, Batman and Damian's relationship as father and son ends, Bruce later proclaiming that Dick was his son and Damian lost the right to that title after Dick's loss. In the Year Two annual, [[Clayface]] takes the form of Dick to infiltrate [[Barbara Gordon]]'s base for Superman, but is eventually discovered and stopped by [[Jim Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], Barbara, and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. In the Year Three series Dick's spirit is called upon by the dying Deadman to replace him, allowing Dick to return to action as he investigates who the Spectre is after finding [[Jim Corrigan]], under the influence of Joker Venom, in Arkham Asylum. Near the end of the series he has a talk with Bruce on how he has no regrets about his life despite the way it ended, declaring love for his adopted father. It is revealed in the annual that before his death he left the Titans to join the Justice League. After the explosion kills Beast Boy and Kid Flash he warns the Titans to stay out of anything to do with Superman. He also had romantic feelings for Starfire at one point, as she urges him to rejoin the Titans, but Dick insists that Batman needs him by his side. In chapter 14 of Year Five he returns to watch over Damian, who has been going through an identity crisis. As the youth goes on to fight several criminals at once Dick notes that while Damian has great skill he is reckless and arrogant, and is forced to intervene when Damian is overwhelmed. He leaves his old outfit with Damian and bemoans that Damian chose to leave Batman, as it has allowed him to fall for the dark influence Superman has.\n\n===''Superman/Batman: Generations''===\nDick Grayson is first seen going off to college in a scene set in 1949, after working with Batman for almost ten years, going on to become a lawyer in New York. At some point between 1959 and 1969, Dick takes on the mantle of Batman with Bruce Wayne Jr. as Robin after Bruce is forced to retire due to old age. Dick is killed by the Joker's latest scheme in 1969, with Bruce Jr. taking Dick's costume so the legacy of Batman can live on, claiming that the Joker 'merely' killed Robin. In ''Superman/Batman: Generations 2'', Dick's ghost begins haunting the Joker in 1975. With the help of Deadman, [[Doctor Occult]], and the ghost of Alfred Pennyworth, Dick and Alfred go into the light, Alfred convincing Dick that tormenting the Joker can serve no purpose but to risk Dick's own soul, now that the Joker is so close to dying of natural causes.\n\n===''Smallville: Season 11''===\nIn the comic book continuation of the television series ''[[Smallville]],'' Dick is Barbara Gordon's boyfriend, who becomes her successor as Nightwing and Batman's replacement partner after she becomes a [[Blue Lantern Corps|Blue Lantern]]. Unlike previous depictions, Dick was never Bruce Wayne's ward and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as Robin, and has made reference that he was a former circus acrobat-turned-police officer prior to becoming Batman's new partner, in the ranks of detectives within Gotham City Police Department.<ref>''Smallville Season Eleven: Continuity'' vol. 1 #4 (March 2015)</ref>\n\n===''Nightwing: The New Order''===\nIn this alternate reality, Nightwing ends an ongoing feud between super-powered beings by activating a device that depowers ninety percent of the super-powered population. This builds to a future where super-powers are outlawed and any super-powered being must take inhibitor medications or be contained and studied should the medications not work on them. Grayson's identity is exposed, but is honored as a hero by the public for eliminating super-powers to ensure the safety of the planet. He becomes the leader of a government task force known as The Crusaders and hunts down super-powered individuals. In his off time, he raises his and Starfire's son, Jake, who soon develops his mother's powers and puts Dick at odds with the system he helped create. After allying with the Titans to help Jake escape, Dick tries to leave with his son, but Jake convinces him to aid the Titans and Superman in restoring the world's super-powers. Dick spent his remaining days watching his son grow into a responsible adult and teaching super-powered children how to control their abilities. As an adult, Jake eventually has a son of his own named Richard in honor of his father.<ref>''Nightwing: The New Order''(2017)</ref>\n\n===''The Gift''===\nIn an alternate timeline where [[Booster Gold]] prevents the murder of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]], Dick Grayson is the one and only Batman who uses lethal force.

These shows included:\n** ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' by [[Filmation]] which ran from 1968 through 1969.\n** ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' which repackaged portions of Filmation's previous series for rebroadcast in 1969.\n** Various ''[[Super Friends]]'' shows produced by [[Hanna\u2013Barbera]] from 1975 through 1985.

While much of the character's past remained the same, Dick's costume from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' was updated to a more modern look with short sleeves and long pants much like Tim Drake's original Robin outfit seen in ''Robin'' #1. While Grayson attended college at Gotham University, he dated [[Barbara Gordon]] but neither was aware of each other's secret identity despite having worked together.<ref>\"Batgirl Returns\"</ref><ref>''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''</ref> Dick eventually retired as Robin and left Gotham after coming to blows with Batman over the Dark Knight's controlling and ruthless behavior. Years later in ''The New Batman Adventures'', the character returned as Nightwing. His Nightwing costume looks identical to the one seen in ''Nightwing'' #1 in late 1996. While he would still work with Batman and Batgirl, he never fully reconciled with the two. Nightwing does, however, establish a strong working bond with his Robin successor [[Tim Drake]]. The character is occasionally referenced in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'',<ref>\"Spellbound\"</ref><ref>\"A Touch of Curar\u00e9\"</ref><ref name=\"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\">''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''</ref> He had non-speaking cameos on the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.\n* While the version of Robin of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series is never directly referred to be Dick Grayson in the cartoon, there are a number of elements of his character that point Dick to be the most likely candidate out of all the other Robins. This includes the color of his costume, a visual of two trapeze artists falling down in a circus tent when Raven was entering Robin's mind in the episode \"Haunted\", Robin becoming Nightwing in the episode \"How Long is Forever?\", his romantic relationship with Starfire, and the episode \"Fractured\" shows an alternate universe version of Robin with exactly the same DNA shows up named Nosyarg Kcid (Dick Grayson spelled backwards). The tie-in comic, ''Teen Titans Go!'' appears to confirm that this version of Robin is indeed Dick Grayson, as issue #47 focuses on Robin struggling through the anniversary of the death of his parents (which are shown to be the Flying Graysons as in the episode \"Haunted\") with the other Titans trying to help him cope. Batman makes a cameo overseeing Titans Tower from the city, and after seeing Robin and Starfire kiss, claims that Robin is \"in better hands\".<ref>''Teen Titans Go!'' #47</ref>\n[[File:Dick Grayson (The Batman).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' as Robin (left) and as Nightwing (right).]]\n\n* Dick Grayson appears as central part in the cast of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Evan Sabara]] (Robin) and by [[Jerry O'Connell]] (Nightwing). Introduced in the fourth season, after the 2003 ''Teen Titans'' TV series had ended, this version is an energetic, gifted 15-year old acrobat and one of the main attractions of Hayley's Circus, along with his parents as part of the amazing Flying Graysons act until [[Tony Zucco]] tried to threaten the Graysons into taking a 'protection' policy, resulting in an altercation where one of Zucco's brothers was easily defeated by Batman. When Zucco altered the Flying Graysons' trapeze act's rigs, Dick's parents fall to their deaths right in front of their son during a performance. With no surviving family members, Dick was taken in by Bruce Wayne. After the two worked together to capture Zucco, Dick chose the 'Robin' codename. Tensions arose when Robin and Batgirl met. While Batgirl has been Batman's wanna-be partner for some time, Robin appeared as Batman's new 'official partner' rather easily (presumably due to Bruce and Dick relating to losing parents). However, this changed when Batman took the liberty of revealing their respective identities and fully accepted each other into the fold. Afterward, Robin and Batgirl developed a more friendly, almost [[sibling]]-like working relationship, but Batgirl has romantic feelings for Robin. As depicted in the future, he has taken up the Nightwing mantle. However, Batman and Oracle still persist in calling Nightwing by his original codename. Batman did this more out of habit while Oracle did it as a flirting sort of way to annoy Nightwing. The character's Robin costume has elements of Tim Drake's two Robin costumes, but still resembles the Robin costume from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and is also influenced heavily by his ''Teen Titans'' counterpart. He is far less serious and genuinely enjoys his work as a vigilante, constantly spouting one-liners and generally acting as a typical teenager and his Golden Age comic counterpart. His Nightwing costume seen in the future resemble the modern costume while the Nightwing costume seen as Robin's online character for an online ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''-esque [[fighting game]] resembles the original design.\n* Dick Grayson appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Crawford Wilson]] (Nightwing) alongside [[Jeremy Shada]] (Robin) and [[Lex Lang]] (Batman). Robin's present-day costume is similar to the one Earth-Two Robin wore near the end of his career, Robin's younger costume is the classic Robin costume, and Nightwing's costume is a nod to the original 1984 version. In the episode \"The Color of Revenge!\", Robin and Batman team up when [[Crazy Quilt]] escapes prison to get revenge on Robin. This teamup takes place sometime after Robin has moved to [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]] and become an independent hero. The episode also has a flashback to his early days and an earlier encounter between the Dynamic Duo and Crazy Quilt. In the episode \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", Robin appears again along with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] facing off against [[Ra's al Ghul]]. At the end of the fight, Dick decides to go on his own as Nightwing. Nightwing is briefly seen in the first part of the episode \"Starro Lives\", where he is one of the many super-heroes whose mind is taken over by the villain [[Starro]]. Eventually, Nightwing is returned to normal like the others. In the teaser for \"Emperor Joker!\", Robin is seen in a flashback to an earlier battle between the Dynamic Duo and [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]. In the episode \"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\", he appears as Robin during a flashback and as Nightwing during the present time. During [[Batwoman]]'s thrill seeking crime fighting that occasionally endangering innocent bystanders, Robin helps Batman. Some years later, Nightwing and Batgirl help Batman (in Batwoman's body) reverse Batwoman's damage. In the episode \"The Knights of Tomorrow!\", he becomes Batman after Bruce Wayne retires and marries [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. After Bruce and Selina are killed by Joker Jr., Batman partners with [[Damian Wayne]] as the new Robin. In the opening for \"Triumvirate of Terror\", Robin was seen in the [[Justice League International]] playing [[baseball]] against the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]].\n* Dick Grayson appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/04/21/breaking-news-from-cartoon-network-warner-bros-animation-and-dc-entertainment/ | last=Hyde | first=David | title=Breaking News From Cartoon Network, Warner Bros.

When the series begins in 2010, Robin is 13 years old (the youngest on the Team but the most experienced). Grayson is forbidden by [[Batman]] to reveal his secret identity to the Team, wearing sunglasses when out of costume (although it appears later on that the original Team members became aware of his identity). He is known for making jokes during battles (such as his frequent use of the word \"whelming\", being a middle ground between \"overwhelming\" and \"underwhelming\") and is good with computers. His origin is the same as in the comics. After a simulated battle, Robin confesses to [[Black Canary]] that he can't dedicate himself completely to 'the mission', realizing that he doesn't want to be like Batman anymore. Grayson is shown to be a strong detective, able to work under pressure, and gains leadership experience throughout the first season. He develops a crush on [[Zatanna]], the culmination of which is a kiss on New Year's Eve. He transitions into Nightwing during ''Young Justice: Invasion''. During the five-year gap between seasons, he allows Jason Todd and Tim Drake to be successors as Robin. He is shown to be a member of the Bat-Family, implying a non-confrontational transition to Nightwing. Nightwing chooses to remain with the Team, rejecting an invitation to join the [[Justice League]]. He acts as team leader and deploys squads on missions (similarly to Batman in Season 1). At the end of Season 2, he chooses to take a leave of absence from the team (returning leadership to [[Aqualad]]), citing that everything happening is 'business as usual'. By Season 3, which begins 2 years later, Grayson is in a relationship with [[Barbara Gordon]], with the latter now assuming her identity of Oracle. His Robin costume is similar to his \"New 52\" costume but designed more practically for urban combat. His Nightwing costume is similar to his third costume from the comics, enhanced with protective gear. This television series is not a direct translation of the ''[[Young Justice]]'' comic book series of the same name or any [[Teen Titans]] storylines, incorporating elements from multiple sources to tell a unique story allowing participation from multiple Robins.\n* A Nightwing animated series was in development for Cartoon Network, but was turned down in favor of ''Young Justice''.<ref>https://io9.gizmodo.com/5932140/artwork-from-scrapped-nightwing-cartoon-shows-off-dc-heroes-legend-of-korra-style/</ref>\n* Dick Grayson's Nightwing costume from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' appears as an easter egg in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' in the episode \"Play Date\".\n\n===Film===\n{{Very long|section|date=April 2017}}\n====Live action====\n=====Serials=====\n* [[Douglas Croft]] portrayed Robin in the 1943 serial ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', which dealt with Batman and Robin's struggle against Dr. Daka, a Japanese scientist who invented a device that turns people into pseudo-zombies.\n* In the 1949 sequel ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', actor [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]] took over the role.

[[Kiefer Sutherland]] had also turned down the role, despite being unaware of the film's tone and direction.

In an earlier script of ''Batman Returns'', he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help Batman following his narrow escape when the Penguin tried to kill him. He would later play a crucial role in Batman's final confrontation with the Penguin. In that script, he was simply called Robin and has no known real name. He was considered for the role in ''[[Batman Forever]]'', but the change in directors from [[Tim Burton]] to [[Joel Schumacher]] would also mean a change in the choice of actor for the role of Robin. Despite not actually appearing in either film, he was reportedly still paid for the role.<ref name=MarlonAV />\n* Dick Grayson is played by actor [[Chris O'Donnell]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]). In the film series, Richard \"Dick\" Grayson is in his mid-to-late teens, and is the younger of two brothers, and the \"Flying Graysons\" act being a family quartet (instead of a trio). Grayson's parents and older brother died after helping to foil [[Two-Face]]'s plan to hold the Social Elite of Gotham City at a Circus charity fundraiser with a bomb. Their deaths were caused when Two-Face shot out the supports for the scaffolding they were hanging on to and they fell to their deaths, the safety net having been removed earlier in their performance. Following their deaths, Dick is taken in as a ward of Bruce Wayne's, although Dick is more interested in taking on and out Two-Face by himself. Suspicious of Bruce's and Alfred Pennyworth's behavior around a certain door they keep locked, Dick ends up finding his way into the [[Batcave]]. Having discovered Wayne's identity as Batman, Dick insists on becoming a crime-fighter himself, taking on the name \"Robin\", an old nickname courtesy of his late father and older brother, and collaborating with Batman to defeat Riddler and Two-Face and avenge his family. Before taking on the name Robin, Dick considers \"Nightwing\" as a possibility.\n* In the [[1997 in film|1997]] sequel ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', Chris O'Donnell reprised the role of Robin. His costume is changed to resemble Nightwing's in the comics, but continues to be \"Robin.\" In the film, he's sick of being in Bruce's shadow and is constantly at odds with Batman thanks to Poison Ivy's powers. Ivy's seduction and pheromones cause Robin to fall blindingly in love with her, and Batman's attempts to stop the two from kissing cause Robin to believe he is jealous, allowing Ivy to tear the duo apart. Robin eventually decides to go solo and prepares to leave to see Ivy when he sees a \"robin-signal\" in the sky, with Batman begging him to trust him about Ivy one more time. Robin arrives at Ivy's lair and convinces her to tell him her plan as a sign of trust. The two share a kiss, but Robin reveals he has covered his lips in rubber, just in case Ivy really was trying to kill him. Ivy, enraged Robin tricked her ''and'' stole a kiss from her, shoves him into her pond to drown him, but he eventually cuts himself free of the vines. He and Batman, now joined by Batgirl, managed to save the city from Mr. Freeze, and after revealing that Ivy was the one who tried to kill Freeze's wife, he gives them a cure for Alfred, who was greatly sick. The trio agree to continue working together, as a family.\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\nIn February 2017, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] is developing a Nightwing live action movie centered on the character set in the [[DC Extended Universe]] with [[Bill Dubuque]] writing the script and ''[[The Lego Batman Movie|The LEGO Batman Movie]]'' director [[Chris McKay]] signed on as director.

During the climax, he briefly dons a Batman armor labeled \"Nightwing\" when attempting to save Barbara Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth.\n\n=====Direct-to-video releases=====\n* Robin appears in the [[direct-to-video]] animated movie ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'', voiced by [[Shane Haboucha]]. In his first appearance in his original costume since the end of ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'', this version apparently was adopted as a teenager after Batman realizes that he is frightening the innocent, instead of being adopted as a child; the circumstances surrounding their meeting are not shown. Robin thought that [[Superman]] was cool and showed great skills in acrobatics in the [[Batcave]].\n* Nightwing appears in the feature film ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. This version is already Nightwing but is alluded as the first version of Robin before [[Jason Todd]]. At the story's start, Nightwing takes down two minor thugs, one of whom knows that Nightwing was once Robin as does the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Nightwing later assists Batman in pursuing the Red Hood but is injured in an explosion set by Red Hood. While being bandaged by [[Alfred Pennyworth]] in the Batcave, he insists on helping Batman but is unable due to his injury and is told to go home but not before he is thanked by the Dark Knight for his help, which surprises him. Nightwing is also seen in the film's epilogue hearing reports of the Joker's arrest.\n* Robin appears in ''[[JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time]]'', voiced by [[Jack DeSena]]. The movie was intended to be a reboot, of sorts, of the classic ''Super Friends'' series, in which Dick Grayson joins Batman and various heroes, the [[Justice League]] in this case, on adventures. Robin plays a supporting role, and acts as somewhat of a foil to the two future [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] members, [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Dawnstar]]. Robin is shown to have a close relationship to Batman, although he tends to ignore his orders.\n* The [[DC Animated Movie Universe]] version of Dick Grayson (voiced by [[Sean Maher]]) appears in ''[[Son of Batman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2014/02/world-premiere-of-son-of-batman-animated-feature-confirmed-for-wondercon-anaheim-2014/|title=World Premiere Of \"Son Of Batman\" Animated Feature Confirmed For WonderCon Anaheim 2014|last=Harvey|first=Jim|publisher=World's Finest Online|date=March 8, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/animated-batman-robin-movie-finds-763553|title=Animated 'Batman vs. Robin' Movie It's Voice Cast (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/nycc-cast-of-batman-bad-blood-reveal-first-footage|title=NYCC: Cast of \"Batman: Bad Blood\" Reveal First Footage|last=Manning|first=Shaun|date=9 October 2015|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/animated-justice-league-vs-teen-titans-feature-reveals-voice-cast|title=Animated \"Justice League vs. Teen Titans\" Feature Reveals Voice Cast|date=18 January 2016|website=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'', ''[[Batman: Hush (film)|Batman: Hush]]'', and ''[[Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/teen-titans-judas-contract-movie-sets-voice-cast-965621|title=Christina Ricci, Miguel Ferrer Join Voice Cast of 'Teen Titans' Animated Movie (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 19, 2017}}</ref> Dick initially appears as Nightwing in ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin''.

Robin is a playable character in the game's multiplayer component, where he works alongside Batman to stop various gang wars between the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]]. A poster for the Flying Graysons can also be seen through the single-player campaign. It is implied that Dick was adopted and trained as Robin by Batman shortly after the events of the main story of the game, before he eventually decided to leave Batman to fight crime on his own in [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]] under his new persona: Nightwing.\n* Nightwing appears as a playable character in the challenge maps for ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', although he doesn't make any appearances in the game's main story. He also has an alternate costume based on his appearance in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.\n* Nightwing plays a major role in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Scott Porter]]. He is part of a sidequest where he works alongside Batman to stop the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s criminal activities in Gotham. He helps Batman track down several of Penguins's vans used to smuggle weapons through the city, which he then follows to warehouses, where Batman and Nightwing proceed to beat up Penguin's goons and destroy his vaults.

After learning of Penguin's plan to have his goons break him out of the GCPD Headquarters, Nightwing travels to Gotham and ultimately foils Penguin's escape, with [[Lucius Fox]]'s aid. After the villain is returned to his cell, Aaron Cash thanks Nightwing for his help and suggests building a new [[Bat-Signal]] for him, but Nightwing declines the offer, stating that it isn't something permanent.\n**Nightwing was later added as a playable character for the game's challenge maps, with two additional skins: his original costume from ''Arkham City'', and his ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' appearance.\n* Nightwing makes a brief appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]''. In the stimulation, Batman investigates Nightwing's death in an alleyway, which Batman is surprised happened given Dick's skill. It is revealed at the end of the game that a Joker-possessed Batman was the one who killed Nightwing, though it also turns out that the entire game was a nightmare that Batman experienced under the influence of the Joker's contaminated blood inside him, taking place shortly before the events of ''Arkham Knight''.\n\n====''Lego DC'' series====\n* The character appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].

Created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 in April 1940 as the original and most popular incarnation of  '''[[Robin (character)|Robin]]''' . In ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|Tales of the Teen Titans]]'' #44 (July 1984) the character retires his role as Robin and assumes the superhero persona of '''[[Nightwing]]''' , created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]].\n\nThe youngest in a family of [[acrobatics|acrobats]] known as the \"[[Flying Graysons]]\", Richard watches a [[Boss (crime)|mafia boss]] named [[Tony Zucco]] kill his parents in order to [[extortion|extort]] money from the [[circus]] that employed them. After the tragic murder, [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) takes Richard (Dick) in as his [[Ward (law)|legal ward]] ([[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an adopted son in some cases) and trains him to become his crime-fighting partner Robin. He is written by many authors as the first son of Batman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=9144|title=Batman and Robin 25 Preview|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> As well as being Batman's crime-fighting partner, Dick establishes himself as the leader of the [[Teen Titans]], a team of teenage superheroes. As a young man, he retires as Robin and takes on his own superhero identity to assert his independence, becoming Nightwing. As Nightwing, he continues to lead the Teen Titans and later the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. In the first volume of his eponymous series (1996\u20132009), he becomes the protector of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], Gotham's economically troubled neighboring city, the locale the character is most closely associated with. He has also been depicted as protecting the streets of New York, Chicago, and Gotham City over the years.\n\nDick Grayson has taken on the identity of Batman on a few occasions. In the aftermath of \"[[Batman: Knightfall]]\", Grayson was not offered the role of Batman while the original was recovering from a broken back as Bruce felt that Nightwing is a hero in his own right and not Batman's understudy, but after the events of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries later that year, he replaces Bruce Wayne as '''[[Batman (Dick Grayson)| Batman]]''', beginning in ''Robin'' #0 (1994) and extending throughout the ''[[Batman: Prodigal]]'' storyline in 1995. Dick again assumes the mantle following the events of \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\" (2008) and ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008\u20132009). As Batman, Dick moves to [[Gotham City]] following his mentor's apparent death and partners with the fifth Robin, [[Damian Wayne]]. On Bruce's return, both men maintained the Batman identity until 2011, when Dick returned to the Nightwing identity with DC's [[The New 52]] continuity reboot. In a 2014 comic story, Dick is forced to abandon the Nightwing identity after being unmasked on TV and faking his death, setting up [[Tim Seeley]]'s ''Grayson'' comic book, Dick becomes '''Agent 37''', Batman's mole in the nefarious spy organization Spyral. Following the conclusion of the ''Grayson'' series, and the restoration of his secret identity in the series' final issue,<ref name=\"Issue 20\">''Grayson'' vol. 1, #20</ref> Dick returns to being Nightwing as part of the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch in 2016.\n\nDick Grayson has appeared as Robin (Batman\u2019s sidekick) in several other media adaptations: [[Batman (serial)|the 1943 serial]] played by [[Douglas Croft]], [[Batman and Robin (serial)|the 1949 serial]] played by [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]], the 1966\u20131968 live action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and its [[Batman (1966 film)|motion picture]] portrayed by [[Burt Ward]], played by [[Chris O'Donnell]] in the 1995 film ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and its 1997 sequel ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. Dick Grayson appears in the ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' television series for the new DC streaming service played by [[Brenton Thwaites]]. [[Loren Lester]] voiced the character Robin in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and later as Nightwing's first screen adaptation in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', and Batman's accidentally adopted son in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

The look inspired Jerry Robinson's design for Robin.<ref name=\"ComicsJournal271\" />{{Rp|83}}\n}}The character was first introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (1940) by Batman creators [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]]. Robin's debut was an effort to get younger readers to enjoy Batman. The name \"Robin, The Boy Wonder\" and the medieval look of the original costume are inspired by the legendary hero [[Robin Hood]]. The costume was designed by [[Jerry Robinson]] who drew it from memory based on Robin Hood illustrations by [[N. C. Wyeth]].<ref name=\"ComicsJournal271\">[[Groth, Gary]] (November 2005). \"Jerry Robinson: Been There, Done That\". ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #271</ref>{{Rp|83}}\n\nIn his first appearance, Dick Grayson is a circus acrobat, and, with his parents, one of the \"[[Flying Graysons]]\". Robin was born on the first day of spring, son of John Grayson and Mary Grayson, a young aerialist couple. While preparing for a performance, Dick overhears two gangsters attempting to extort [[protection money]] from the circus owner. The owner refuses, so the gangsters sabotage the trapeze wires with acid. During the next performance, the trapeze from which Dick's parents are swinging snaps, sending them to their deaths. Before he can go to the police, Batman appears to him and warns him that the two gangsters work for [[Tony Zucco]], a very powerful crime boss, and that revealing his knowledge could lead to his death. When Batman recounts the murder of his [[Thomas Wayne|own]] [[Martha Wayne|parents]], Dick asks to become his aide. After extensive training, Dick becomes Robin. They start by disrupting Zucco's gambling and extortion rackets. They then successfully bait the riled Zucco into visiting a construction site, where they capture him.\n\nRobin's origin has a thematic connection to Batman's in that both see their parents killed by criminals, creating an urge to battle the criminal element. Bruce sees a chance to direct the anger and rage that Dick feels in a way that he himself cannot, thus creating a father/son bond and understanding between the two. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, DC Comics portrayed Batman and Robin as a team, deeming them the \"Dynamic Duo\", rarely publishing a ''Batman'' story without his sidekick; stories entirely devoted to Robin appeared in ''[[Star-Spangled Comics]]'' from 1947 through 1952.\n\nThe character history of the [[Earth-Two]] Robin accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1940s and 1950s, while the adventures of the mainstream [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (who lived on \"[[Earth-One]]\") begin later in time and with certain elements of his origin retold. Both were depicted as separate, though parallel, individuals living in their respective universes, with the \"older\" Earth-Two character eventually reaching death in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\n===Teen Titans===\n[[File:Tales of the Teen Titans 44.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson's debut as Nightwing; from ''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #44 (July 1984)]]\n1964's ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #54 introduces a junior version of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. This team is led by the modern-day Robin, residing on Earth-One, and was joined by two other teenage sidekicks, [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] (sidekick of [[Aquaman]]) and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] (sidekick of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]), to stop the menace of Mr. Twister.\n\nLater, the three sidekicks join forces with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] in order to free their mentors in the [[Justice League|JLA]] from mind-controlled thrall. They decide to become a real team: the [[Teen Titans]]. By virtue of the tactical skills gleaned from Batman, Robin is swiftly recognized as leader before the Titans disband some years later.\n\nIn 1969, still in the Pre-''Crisis'' continuity, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] return Batman to his darker roots. One part of this effort is writing Robin out of the series by sending Dick Grayson to [[Hudson University]] and into a separate strip in the back of ''Detective Comics''. The by-now Teen Wonder appears only sporadically in ''Batman'' stories of the 1970s as well as in a short-lived revival of ''The Teen Titans''.\n\nIn 1980, Grayson once again takes up the role of leader of the Teen Titans, now featured in the monthly series ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', which became one of DC Comics's most beloved series of the era. During his leadership of the Titans, however, he had a falling out with Batman, leading to an estrangement that would last for many years.\n\n===Nightwing===\nIn the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' continuity, the maturing Dick Grayson grows weary of his role as Batman's young sidekick. He renames himself [[Nightwing]], recalling his adventure in the [[Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], where he and Batman meet the local hero of the same name. He maintains this identity during his role in the Teen Titans, and occasionally returns to assist Batman and his successors as Robin in the form of Jason Todd and Tim Drake, Tim in particular becoming a younger brother figure to him.\n\nWhen Bruce's back is broken by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] during the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' story arc, Bruce selects [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] as his replacement as Batman as he does not want to burden Dick with the role and fears that Dick may go after Bane in revenge. However, when Valley proves to be too unstable to be Batman, Bruce undergoes a rigorous recovery and training program with the aid of Doctor [[Shondra Kinsolving]] and [[Lady Shiva]] to restore him to full health, defeating Valley with Dick and Tim's aid. However, feeling that he needs to re-evaluate Batman and his mission after Valley's defeat, Bruce leaves Gotham once again, after appointing Dick as his successor during the \"Prodigal\" story arc. While acting as Batman, Dick is left with a clearer idea of the psychological stresses Bruce must endure in the role, as well as facing some of Bruce's newer enemies \u2014 such as Killer Croc, the Ventriloquist and the Ratcatcher \u2014 while settling his own long-standing issues with Two-Face.\n\n====Miniseries and afterward====\nIn ''Nightwing: Alfred's Return'' #1 (1995), Dick Grayson travels to [[England]] to find [[Alfred Pennyworth]] who had resigned from Bruce Wayne's service following the events of the ''KnightSaga''. Before returning to Gotham City together, they prevent an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the British government that involves destroying the [[Channel Tunnel]] under the [[English Channel]].\n\nLater on, with the ''Nightwing'' miniseries (September to December 1995, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] with [[Greg Land]] as artist), Dick briefly considers retiring from being Nightwing forever before family papers uncovered by Alfred reveal a possible link between the murder of the Flying Graysons and the Crown Prince of Kravia. Journeying to Kravia, Nightwing helps to topple the murderous Kravian leader and prevent an ethnic cleansing, while learning his parents' true connection to the Prince; they witnessed the original Prince being killed and replaced with an impostor who became as bad as his predecessor (although Zucco killed the Graysons before the conspirators could do anything about it). In the aftermath, Dick returns to his role as Nightwing, recognizing that, for all his problems with Bruce, Bruce never ''made'' him become Robin or join his crusade, accepting that he imitated Bruce's example because Bruce was worthy of imitation.\n\nIn 1996, following the success of the miniseries, DC Comics launched a monthly solo series featuring Nightwing (written by [[Chuck Dixon]], with art by [[Scott McDaniel]]), in which he patrols Gotham City's neighboring municipality of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], relocating there to investigate a series of murders and remaining as he recognized that the city needed protection. He remains the city's guardian for some time, facing foes such as [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] and new villains such as [[Torque (DC Comics)|Torque]], and even becomes a police officer so that he can make an impact on the city's criminal activity in both parts of his life. Later, Grayson divides his duties between Bludhaven and Gotham after [[Batman: Cataclysm|a devastating earthquake]] and the subsequent decision to declare Gotham a [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]], Grayson occasionally assisting his mentor and other members of Bat-Family in maintaining and restoring order in Gotham until it is fully rebuilt. When the Justice League vanished into the past fighting ancient sorceress [[Gamemnae]], Nightwing was selected as the leader of the reserve League created by an emergency program Batman had established in the event of his League being defeated, Batman describing Nightwing as the only person he could have picked to lead the new team.\n\nEventually, the original League are restored, and Nightwing departs along with some of his League-although others remain as some of the original team take a leave of absence-although Batman notes that his leadership of the League proves that he is ready for more responsibilities. However, the death of Blockbuster prompts Nightwing to leave Bludhaven due to his crisis of conscience; Blockbuster was killed by vigilante [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]] and Nightwing did not stop it even when he had the chance to do so. While Nightwing returns to Gotham to heal after assisting Batman in dealing with a series of gang wars, Bl\u00fcdhaven is destroyed by the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] when they drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] on it.\n\nDuring the battle of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Grayson suffers a near-fatal injury from [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] when he shields Wayne from Luthor's attack.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7 (2006)</ref> Originally, the editors at DC intended to have Grayson killed in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as [[Newsarama]] revealed from the DC Panel at WizardWorld Philadelphia:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |title=WizardWorld Philadelphia: DCU panel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125311/http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{{bquote|It was again explained that Nightwing was originally intended to die in ''Infinite Crisis'', and that you can see the arc that was supposed to end with his death in the series.

The next arc of the ongoing series will further explain the changes, it was said.}}\n\nAfter spending some time away with Bruce and Tim to heal and rebuild after their harsh times prior to the Crisis, Dick relocates to New York, but has trouble finding work as both Dick Grayson and Nightwing. During the ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' storyline, Nightwing is ambushed by the International Club of Villains. He is later seen being held in [[Arkham Asylum]], where one of the surgeons, in reality also the civilian identity of ICoV member Le Bossu, arranged for Nightwing to be admitted under the name of Pierrot Lunaire (another ICoV member) and be kept both heavily drugged and regularly beaten by staff to subdue him. Scheduled for an experimental [[lobotomy]] by Le Bossu himself, he manages to free himself and come to Batman's aid for the finale of the story arc.\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\nFollowing the events of Batman's apparent death during the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Nightwing has closed down shop in New York so as to return to Gotham, where after the events of \"[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]\", he assumes the identity of Batman, with [[Damian Wayne]], Bruce Wayne's biological son, as the new Robin.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1\u20133</ref>\n\nThe new team of Batman and Robin is the focus of Grant Morrison and [[Frank Quitely]]'s ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=11864 |title=Batman & Robin #1 |website=DCComics.com |accessdate=28 April 2015 |quote=reunited team of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely....

Over time, Dick's experience as the Dark Knight would harden his personality as his mentor.\n\nDuring this period, Dick Grayson as Batman also features as a member of the [[Justice League]] in a short-lived run by writer [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]]. After an intense confrontation with the Club of Villains and the mysterious Doctor Simon Hurt (who has established fake evidence that he is actually Bruce's father [[Thomas Wayne]]), Hurt is defeated when Bruce returns to the present. However, Bruce leaves Dick to continue to act as Batman in Gotham with Damian as his partner while he sets up the new 'Batman Incorporated' program, Bruce publicly identifying himself as Batman's financial backer to justify a global Batman-themed operation where he funds multiple other vigilantes.\n\n===''The New 52'' (2011\u20132016)===\n{{See also|The New 52}}\nDick Grayson is re-established as Nightwing following DC's ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crossover event, after which the publisher relaunched all of its titles and made alterations to its continuity as part of an initiative called [[The New 52]]. In the new status quo, Bruce Wayne is once again the only Batman, and Dick, like the other members of the adoptive family, is a few years younger. Dick, despite being 19 is drawn a bit shorter than in his pre-relaunch frame. This is likely due to adding believability to his acrobat past.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.comicvine.com/news/whats-changed-and-whats-the-same-in-batman-1-spoilers/143603/ |title=What's Changed and What's the Same in Batman #1?

In ''Nightwing'', Dick inherits the deed to the circus from a dying C. C. Haly and begins a relationship with his childhood friend acrobat Raya Vestri. Saiko tortures Haly for information on Nightwing's secret identity, and the old man dies in Dick's arms after telling him the circus holds a terrible secret.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #2</ref> Investigating leads, he tracks down a supervillain named Feedback, who used to be a childhood friend, but does not learn anything.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #3</ref> Following Haly's clues, he finds a mysterious Book of Names in the circus that has his name on the last page.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #4</ref> Later the circus announces they will be doing a memorial show on the anniversary of the night Dick's parents were murdered, and Saiko attacks by detonating a massive explosion.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #6</ref>\n\nIt is then revealed that the circus has been training assassins for years, and Saiko was a childhood friend using Raya as an accomplice. Grayson had been selected to become a new Talon for the Court of Owls, but when Batman adopted him, Saiko took his place. The killer plummets to his death and Raya turns herself in. Returning to the Batcave, Bruce reveals to Dick that the current Talon is his great-grandfather William Cobb.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #7</ref> During the [[Night of the Owls]] event Dick faces Cobb, who was revived while protecting Mayor Hady.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #8\u20139</ref> Following the event, Dick decided to keep Haly's Circus in Gotham and plans to invest in turning an abandoned amusement park into their new location without Bruce's money.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #10</ref> He works with Sonia Branch, the daughter of Tony Zucco, the crime boss who murdered Dick's parents, into getting a loan for this plan by investing his entire trust fund despite being a high-risk due to Saiko's recent attack. The problems arise because of the guilt Sonia feels towards her father's actions <ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #11\u201312</ref> and many members of the circus are afraid for their lives because of the previous disasters and accuse Dick Grayson of being a flake, making it hard for those who choose to stay.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #13</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Death of the Family]]\" crossover event across the ''Batman''-related comic books led to a major shift in Nightwing's status quo. During the storyline, one of Dick's friends Jimmy Clark, who worked as a circus clown, was murdered by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] because Joker felt like Jimmy was a knockoff of him. Nightwing later discovers Joker broke Raya out of prison, infected her with his Joker venom and has forced her to fight him while wearing a makeshift Nightwing costume. The toxin eventually killed Raya, though Nightwing tried in vain with an anti-toxin to save her. Nightwing then discovered that Joker left a message on Raya's abdomen that he was targeting Haly's Circus next.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #15</ref> However upon arriving there, Joker unveils his plan to burn the circus to the ground and then infects Nightwing with his gas that not only causes him to experience hallucinations of Jimmy and Raya, but he is soon attacked by the other members of Haly's Circus that were also affected by the toxin allowing Joker to capture him.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #16</ref>\n\n[[File:NightwingNew52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nightwing as he appears in the New 52. Art by Brett Booth.]]\nIn the aftermath, Haly's Circus is gone, with Dick broke as a result for having lost his investment. While the other circus members survived since Joker used a different Joker venom on them, they blame Dick and decide to leave after Raya and Jimmy's funeral, though deep down they know it is not his fault. Dick becomes bitter from his loss. After he used excessive force to bring down some criminals that tried to plunder valuables from the remains of the circus, Damian, having been monitoring him, is able to talk some sense into Nightwing, which helps him recover.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #17</ref>\n\nNightwing is later deeply affected by the death of Damian following his murder at the hands of Damian's clone, the Heretic, in ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. With Damian's death and potential resurrection becoming an obsession of Batman's, Dick is shunned by Bruce when he tries to tell him to move on, in ''Batman and Nightwing'' (a retitled ''Batman & Robin'' #23).\n\nLater, the ''Nightwing'' series changes its setting to Chicago, Illinois. Sonia Branch reveals to Dick an e-mail that indicates that her father Zucco is still alive. After giving the address to [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] to try and track down who sent it, Robin uncovers that Zucco is residing in Chicago. Nightwing moves to Chicago in order to find and arrest Zucco, who is now living under the assumed identity of Billy Lester, an assistant to the mayor. Soon after arriving in Chicago, Dick meets his new roommates, a photojournalist named Michael and a computer specialist named Joey. After leaving the apartment to meet with Johnny Spade, a borderline criminal who steals and sells information, their meeting is interrupted by the police. A short chase results in the accidental destruction of a newly rebuilt subway. Meanwhile, a criminal hacker called the Prankster tortures, maims and kills criminal [[Confidence trick|con men]] who are untouchable by the police.\n\nThe Chicago story is later abruptly ended by Nightwing's role in a larger company-wide crossover event. After the Crime Syndicate invade Earth Prime at the conclusion of the \"[[Trinity War]]\" ''Justice League'' storyline and defeat the Justice League, the DC crossover story ''[[Forever Evil]]'' depicts Nightwing's capture by the [[Crime Syndicate]], who expose his secret identity to the world. Following their escape from the Syndicate, Batman and [[Catwoman]] decide to rescue him. He then is invited by [[Owlman (DC Comics)|Owlman]] to help defeat the Crime Syndicate, which he accepts. Nightwing is severely beaten by [[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]] and is attached to a device from a parallel world known as the Murder Machine, which is controlled by his heart rate and is reportedly impossible to escape from alive. When Batman and [[Lex Luthor]] arrive to free him, Lex stops his heart in order to fool the system so he can disarm it. However, Batman, enraged over what Lex has done, attacks him. Luthor explains it is not too late to save Grayson.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> In an uncharacteristically heroic moment, Luthor injects Grayson's heart with adrenaline, which successfully revives Grayson. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] enters, having defeated Grid, and Grayson joins Batman, Cyborg and Catwoman in freeing the Justice League from the Firestorm Matrix. After the defeat of the Syndicate, Grayson is seen with Batman in the [[Batcave]]. Batman tells him that he has to send him on the most dangerous mission he could possibly undertake.\n\n====''Grayson''====\nThe ''Nightwing'' title concluded in April 2014 at issue #30, and was replaced with a new title, ''[[Grayson (comic book)|Grayson]]'', which depicts Dick having given up his life as Nightwing at age 22 and going undercover as an agent of the Spyral organization where the former [[Batwoman (identity)|Batwoman]] [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Kane]] works.<ref>{{ cite web| url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/15/dc-reveals-dick-graysons-post-forever-evil-fate | title= DC Reveals Dick Grayson's Post-Forever Evil Fate| website= IGN.com | date= 15 April 2014}}</ref> Written by Tim Seeley and former [[CIA]] counter-terrorism officer [[Tom King (comics)|Tom King]], the career change for Dick Grayson comes from the urging of Batman himself, who convinces him to remain dead to the world.

He assists Spyral's agenda to know more about Minos and his endgame, resulting in Spyral attaining most of the scattered organs. In a later story arc, Minos betrays Spyral and attempts to leak its secrets.

Mother intends to trigger a global collapse with the reasoning that the survivors will rebuild a stronger world after being broken by tragedy and without the hindrance of parents to force their ideals on them, but Grayson and the rest of the Family are able to defeat her, Dick affirming that Batman helps the Robins become their own people who can avoid the mistakes he made in dealing with his own trauma rather than Mother's belief that she and Batman each teach people to use their trauma to define themselves. At the conclusion of the storyline, Dick meets with the restored Batman, assuring Bruce that, unlike Mother, he never forced his ideals on them, but simply gave them all an example that they chose to emulate while avoiding following it so exactly that they became like him.\n\nWhen the [[Court of Owls]] plant a bomb inside Damian Wayne, they are able to blackmail Dick into officially joining their organization, although all sides are aware that Grayson intends to try and use his new position against them.<ref>''Robin War'' #1\u20132</ref> The ''Grayson'' series ended at issue #20, where in the final issue, it was revealed that all knowledge of Dick's identity was erased from most of the world with one of Spyral's satellites, allowing Dick to resume his superhero activities as Nightwing once again.<ref name=\"Issue 20\"/>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\n[[File:Nightwing v4 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Nightwing]] as he appears on the cover of ''Nightwing'', vol. 4 #4 (November 2016).

After knocking Dick out, Raptor goes to Gotham and kidnaps Bruce during a conference. Nightwing confronts him alone in the ruins of a circus in Paris. Raptor reveals that he grew up in the circus as a child and fell in love with Dick's mother, Mary, as they stole from the rich and powerful in Paris. Raptor watched over Dick in the shadows as he grew up, and developed a hatred for Bruce Wayne as he represented everything he and Mary were against and felt it was dishonoring her memory to have Dick raised by him.

He also carries several dozen modified [[batarang]]s (called wing-dings) along with de-cel jumplines and gas capsules.<ref name=\"Nightwing: Secret Files and Origins\"/>\n\nHaving had the finest education as Bruce Wayne's [[Ward (law)|ward]], he is fluent in Spanish, Russian, Mandarin, Cantonese, the alien language of Tamaran, conversant in [[American Sign Language]],<ref>''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #44 (July 1984)</ref> [[French language|French]],<ref>''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #14 (April 2001)</ref> [[Italian language|Italian]],<ref>''Nightwing'' vol. 2 #72 (October 2002)</ref> [[Persian language|Persian]],<ref>''Robin'' vol. 2 #175 (August 2008)</ref> and [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]].<ref>''The Power Company: Manhunter'' #1 (March 2002)</ref> He is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with [[superlative]] leadership skills, having served as leader to the [[Teen Titans|Titans]], the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and even the [[Justice League]]. Additionally, Dick's interpersonal skills and efforts to remain in contact with other heroes makes him a master at rallying, unifying, and inspiring the superhero community, a skill in which he has surpassed his mentor;<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #3 (February 2006)</ref> when the pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman received the praise of the New 52 Nightwing, Superman noted that, in any reality, it is high praise to be vouched for by Dick Grayson.\n\nBesides his resources as Bruce Wayne's adopted son and heir, Dick's parents also left him a trust fund which [[Lucius Fox]] turned into a small fortune. Although it is not comparable to Bruce Wayne's wealth, it has been enough to maintain his Nightwing equipment, purchase the rights to Haly's Circus (saving Dick's former home from financial troubles),<ref>\"Nightwing Vol. 2\" #6</ref> and secretly buy his former Bl\u00fcdhaven apartment building at 1013 Parkthorne Avenue.<ref>\"Nightwing\" Vol. 1 #13</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nDick Grayson's Robin costume alluded to the [[American robin]] and [[Robin Hood]]. The cape was alternately depicted as yellow or green. The costume also featured [[crakow (shoe)|crakow-style shoes]], which some artists would discard from the portrayal.\n\n[[File:Nightwing (Dick Grayson circa 1995).png|thumb|right|[[Nightwing]]'s iconic blue and black costume as it debuts on the interior art of ''Nightwing'' (vol. 1) #2 (September 1995). Art by [[Greg Land]].]]\nDick Grayson's Nightwing costume was made of a version of the [[Nomex]] fire-resistant, triple-weave [[Kevlar]]-lined material. It was an excellent protection against damage, and was also insulated against electricity. Specifically tailored to his style of fighting, Nightwing's costume had fewer body-armor inlays than Batman, anticipating a decreased need for shock absorption and an increased capacity for motion. Against opponents both fast and strong, Nightwing had supplemental body-armor overlays he could attach to his gauntlets, boots, shoulders, and mask. Instead of a black cape to keep him hidden, which Grayson dislikes wearing,<ref name=\"Batman 688\">''Batman'' #688</ref><ref name=\"Batman and Robin #2\">''Batman and Robin'' #2</ref> the suit was light sensitive, darkening when there was more light in the area. The mask, in the form of his symbol, was fixed in place with [[spirit gum]], and included a built-in [[radio]] transmitter/receiver and Starlite [[night vision]] lenses. The third costume, with its stylized blue \"wing\" across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers, over a black bodysuit, made its first appearance in ''Nightwing: Ties That Bind'' #2 (October 1995), and was designed by the cover artist Brian Stelfreeze. His suit was also equipped with wings that allow him to glide.\n\nAs Batman, his [[Batsuit]] featured a lighter cape to accommodate his more acrobatic fighting style<ref name=\"Batman 688\"/> and a [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]] with a bat-shaped buckle.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #1\">''Batman and Robin'' #1</ref> He also developed \"para-capes\" for his and Damian's costumes which gave them the ability to glide.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #1\"/> Grayson is noticeably shorter than Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"Batman and Robin #2\"/>\n\nPost-Flashpoint with his return to Nightwing, Dick wore a similar suit, albeit with the blue \"wing\" being red throughout the New 52. Previously in the New 52's continuity as Nightwing, he formerly owned an armored suit which was blue and yellow, resembling a modern take of his previous first costume in the previous continuity and another that was an armored suit that sported a red bat symbol, in which is currently being used by [[Jason Todd]] though slightly modified for Jason's taste.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' (vol. 1) #6</ref> Formerly before having to leave the Nightwing mantle post ''Forever Evil'', his suit was made up of sturdy but flexible material that not only suited his strength in speed and acrobatics, but also was durable enough to take bullets from machine guns. His former costume was a stylized red \"wing\" across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers, over a black torso and legs. He also has gauntlets much like Batman's own suit. Nightwing's costume is tailored specifically to his unique style of crime-fighting. He also has variants of his costume in which one of his stylized red \"wings\" reach only to his shoulders, another to his wrists, and one in which has hip and finger stripes.\n\nSome versions of Dick's story as Nightwing do not make clear whether the public at large knows that the first Robin is now Nightwing, or whether he is simply an entirely new hero. A [[metafiction]]al foreword (said to have been made by a future historian) to a trade paperback for \"A Death In The Family\" made the claim that the public at large always thought there was just one Robin. In versions that do address it, Dick and Bruce seem to want to spread the belief that Nightwing started his career as an adult, the better to hide their true identities. The series ''Grayson'' seems to indicate that the public does not know, as Midnighter did not think to study Robin's techniques in preparation for his fight with Grayson, an advantage the latter exploited.<ref>\"Grayson\" #6</ref>\n\nDuring his time as Agent 37 for Spyral, Dick uses identity protection implants that ensure that neither cameras nor the memory of e.g. target persons can capture his face. He also was incorporated with a pair hypnotic contacts which Dick used to mind control someone if they looked directly into his eye. Additionally he still carries a pair of Escrima Sticks. He was required to carry a gun as part of Spyral protocol.<ref>\"Grayson\" #1</ref>\n\nStarting with Rebirth, Dick returns to being Nightwing, once again in black and blue. The \"wing\" is replaced by a thinner, v-shaped bird that starts and the chest and goes up to the shoulders and around to the back. His domino mask is now blue, instead of black. The shins and calves of his legs feature a big \"swish\" of blue. He wears a black leather strap and buckle on each of his forearms. The intention of this redesign is to harken back to the iconic black and blue look of the third Nightwing costume introduced in 1995, maintain the simplicity of the aforementioned iconic look, creating a more visible bird symbol, while also highlighting Dick's face with a lighter coloured mask and his legs which can allow for more dynamic art when he is in motion.<ref>Nightwing: Rebirth #1</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the Amalgam Universe, Dick was combined with the Marvel character [[Moon Knight]] and became '''Moonwing'''. He was a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent who selected Jason Todd as his successor when he temporarily left S.H.I.E.L.D. to attend college. As Moonwing, Jason made a careless mistake, which resulted in a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's death, causing him to be dismissed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Jason became furious and blamed his mentors. He was then caught in an explosion when the villain Hyena detonated a bomb intended to kill Director Bruce Wayne and the [[Wolverine (character)|Dark Claw]]. Despite his body never being recovered, S.H.I.E.L.D. presumed he was dead, but he survived and his body was recovered by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], who replaced his damaged body parts with robotic parts, transforming him into [[Deathlok]]. He then participated in a coup to help [[Catwoman|Madame Cat]] overthrow the Supreme Leader of Hydra, [[Lex Luthor]] a.k.a. the Green Skull. Afterwards, he swore allegiance to her. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents launched an attack on HYDRA's base, Deathlok was sent to confront them, where he spotted his former mentor, Moonwing, and attacked him from behind. He then revealed that he has been waiting a long time to kill both Dick and Bruce. He then unmasked Moonwing and accused him and Bruce of abandoning him. He then began strangling Dick, but before he could kill him Colonel [[Nick Fury]] and [[Sgt. Rock|Sergeant Joe Rock]] commandeered an aircraft and shot Deathlok several times in the back. Despite feeling sorry for Jason, Dick left Jason to die again so he could continue the attack on the HYDRA base.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1</ref>\n\n===''Kingdom Come'' (Post-''Infinite Crisis'' Earth 22)===\n[[File:Red Robin (Kingdom Come).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson as an alternate version of Red Robin in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''.

He also has a daughter, [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] (Mar'i Grayson), whom he fathered with Starfire. Nightstar aligns herself with Batman's Outsiders and romantically involves with his and Talia al Ghul's son, Ibn al Xu'ffasch. After Ibn and Mar'i marries, they have a daughter and son, and thus Dick and Bruce Wayne become in-laws and grandfathers of their respective progenies' children. Dick and Bruce reconcile at the end of the story.\n\n===''JLA: The Nail'' and ''JLA: Another Nail''===\nIn the Elseworlds mini-series ''[[JLA: The Nail]],'' Dick Grayson (as Robin), along with [[Barbara Gordon]] (as Batgirl), are tortured to death by the Joker with his [[Kryptonian]] gauntlets, driving Batman temporarily insane after he witnesses their ordeals and demise. The grief-stricken hero then kills the Joker for revenge. Later, in the sequel ''[[JLA: Another Nail]],'' Dick returns as a spirit after the Joker escapes from Hell. He helps Batman defeat the villain once and for all, and seeing Dick is at peace after his death gives Batman the strength to move on.\n\n===''Batman Beyond''===\nThe 2010 comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' features [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] facing a new incarnation of [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. After ruling out Tim Drake as a suspect, Terry questions Dick Grayson who now runs an athletics training course after retiring as Nightwing due to sustaining severe gunshot wounds (including the loss of an eye) in a battle between the Joker and Batman.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (October 2010)</ref> Though Dick gives an alibi, Hush later incapacitates Terry and removes his bandages to reveal the face of a youthful version of Dick with both eyes intact.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #4 (November 2010)</ref> It is later revealed that Hush is actually a clone of Grayson, created by [[Project Cadmus]] under the guidance of [[Amanda Waller]] in order to ensure that the world will always have a Batman.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #5 (November 2010)</ref> Hush later dies during a final confrontation with Terry, the real Dick Grayson, and a new [[Catwoman#Other versions|Catwoman]], after they thwart the villain's plan to destroy Gotham. He is told over the comlink with Bruce that he is still his heir but Dick rips off the connection still too hurt to talk to Bruce.\n\nDick later serves as a supporting character for the ongoing series. When a GCPD detective discovers Dick's past as Nightwing due to Hush's recent actions, Terry and Maxine \"Max\" Gibson attempt to convince the public otherwise by having Terry masquerade as his former identity while Max plants numerous false alibis for Dick throughout the internet. In the end, Dick partially admits the truth to Gotham without jeopardizing his allies' secrets, claiming he was a paid agent of ''Batman Inc.'', as the new Batman. The detective who threatened to expose Dick still plans to sue Dick but is \"persuaded\" not to by Terry.\n\nIt is revealed that, after the events in the ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' flashbacks and after what happened to Tim, Barbara gave up her Batgirl identity and broke off her relationship with Bruce, which Dick never knew about. Barbara resumed her relationship with Dick but was hesitant to confess to him that she had dated Bruce. Dick planned to propose to Barbara. Bruce himself ultimately confessed to their relationship after finding out that he had gotten Barbara pregnant; furthermore, he wanted to be involved in the life of their child. Barbara, however, unable to leave behind her vigilante life, fought a mugger and ultimately miscarried her child. These events, as well as her sense that she destroyed the bond between Dick and Bruce, caused Barbara's relationship with Dick to disintegrate and eventually led her to marry Sam Young. Losing Barbara caused Dick to become estranged from Bruce for his role. Later on, when Terry learns Bruce's impact on the former couple, he then sides with Grayson. In the parallel universe where the [[Justice Lords]] reside, Dick's counterpart is happily married to Barbara's and they had a son named after his father, John Grayson, together. Bruce's Justice Lord counterpart was happily married to [[Wonder Woman]] as well until her Justice Lord counterpart killed him. The events in the Justice Lords' world cause Dick envying of the life his counterpart leads with his wife. Terry also becomes friends with Dick's counterpart, helping him training his own into the new Batman in Justice Lords' world.\n\nIn the 2013 Digital Comic Batman Beyond 2.0 it is revealed that Terry has now left Bruce's employment since leaving high school and is now working for Grayson as Batman with Dick taking on the role of support for Terry. While Terry finds working with Dick easier than Bruce, Dick reminds Terry of his commitment to his family and to his education.\n\nIn the rebooted ''Batman Beyond'' timeline that takes place after ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'', Dick is now the mayor of Bl\u00fcdhaven and has both eyes intact. He also has a daughter named Elainna, who became the new Batwoman in the \"First Flight\" storyline.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' Vol. 7 #37-40.</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Dick Grayson and his parents are part of the Haley Circus acrobats, featured in a show alongside [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Boston Brand]]. In a vision that [[Doctor Fate]] gives Boston Brand, Boston is standing over Dick's body. Before the next show, Boston tries to convince Dick to perform solo. However, Dick tells him that family means too much to him. Dick poses the question that Boston's seeming fearlessness could stem from his insecurity of being alone.<ref>''[[Deadman and the Flying Graysons|Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons]]'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> During the attack on Haley Circus by the Amazons, Dick's mother falls to the ground in the ensuing madness.

While they are hiding, Dick's father is fatally wounded by the Amazons. Boston tells him to leave his father but Dick refuses. Later, Dick's dying father makes Boston promise to protect his son.<ref>''Flashpoint: [[Deadman and the Flying Graysons]]'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Afterwards, Dick and Boston run at the countryside looking for reinforcements, when they are soon caught in an explosion. Dick survived, but his friend Boston is killed. When he walks towards his friend's body, he is unaware of the fact that he walks through the ghost of Boston. Dick manages to kill the Amazons (including Starfire, who had joined with them) in a gasoline explosion. Meeting up with the Resistance, Dick becomes the new Doctor Fate. He is aided by the ghostly Boston, who lets him know that he is not alone.<ref>''[[Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons]]'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Earth 2 (New 52)''===\nOn Earth 2, Dick Grayson is a journalist who is forced to live in a survival camp with his son John and his wife Barbara Gordon due to an invasion of [[Parademon]]s. After the fatal shooting of his wife, the disappearance of his son, and the death of the second Batman, Dick becomes the third Batman of Earth 2 where he attempts to diminish crime following the end of [[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]. He is later reunited with John, who in turn becomes the new Robin of Earth 2. Later, Dick becomes wheelchair bound and adopts a new alias as Oracle while [[Helena Wayne]] becomes the fourth Batman with John fighting by her side as her Robin.\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the alternate world of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)|Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Dick remains firmly aligned with Batman's views of law and order even as Superman begins a more forceful approach of ending crime. When he announces his plan to take away the inhabitants of Arkham Asylum, Dick joins Batman in going to stop him. Batman's biological son Damian, however, believes in Superman's cause and sides with him. During a skirmish at the asylum Damian inadvertently kills Dick by throwing his kali stick at him, causing Dick to fall over and break his neck when he lands on a rock positioned in just the wrong location. After this action, Batman and Damian's relationship as father and son ends, Bruce later proclaiming that Dick was his son and Damian lost the right to that title after Dick's loss. In the Year Two annual, [[Clayface]] takes the form of Dick to infiltrate [[Barbara Gordon]]'s base for Superman, but is eventually discovered and stopped by [[Jim Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], Barbara, and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. In the Year Three series Dick's spirit is called upon by the dying Deadman to replace him, allowing Dick to return to action as he investigates who the Spectre is after finding [[Jim Corrigan]], under the influence of Joker Venom, in Arkham Asylum. Near the end of the series he has a talk with Bruce on how he has no regrets about his life despite the way it ended, declaring love for his adopted father. It is revealed in the annual that before his death he left the Titans to join the Justice League. After the explosion kills Beast Boy and Kid Flash he warns the Titans to stay out of anything to do with Superman. He also had romantic feelings for Starfire at one point, as she urges him to rejoin the Titans, but Dick insists that Batman needs him by his side. In chapter 14 of Year Five he returns to watch over Damian, who has been going through an identity crisis. As the youth goes on to fight several criminals at once Dick notes that while Damian has great skill he is reckless and arrogant, and is forced to intervene when Damian is overwhelmed. He leaves his old outfit with Damian and bemoans that Damian chose to leave Batman, as it has allowed him to fall for the dark influence Superman has.\n\n===''Superman/Batman: Generations''===\nDick Grayson is first seen going off to college in a scene set in 1949, after working with Batman for almost ten years, going on to become a lawyer in New York. At some point between 1959 and 1969, Dick takes on the mantle of Batman with Bruce Wayne Jr. as Robin after Bruce is forced to retire due to old age. Dick is killed by the Joker's latest scheme in 1969, with Bruce Jr. taking Dick's costume so the legacy of Batman can live on, claiming that the Joker 'merely' killed Robin. In ''Superman/Batman: Generations 2'', Dick's ghost begins haunting the Joker in 1975. With the help of Deadman, [[Doctor Occult]], and the ghost of Alfred Pennyworth, Dick and Alfred go into the light, Alfred convincing Dick that tormenting the Joker can serve no purpose but to risk Dick's own soul, now that the Joker is so close to dying of natural causes.\n\n===''Smallville: Season 11''===\nIn the comic book continuation of the television series ''[[Smallville]],'' Dick is Barbara Gordon's boyfriend, who becomes her successor as Nightwing and Batman's replacement partner after she becomes a [[Blue Lantern Corps|Blue Lantern]].

This builds to a future where super-powers are outlawed and any super-powered being must take inhibitor medications or be contained and studied should the medications not work on them. Grayson's identity is exposed, but is honored as a hero by the public for eliminating super-powers to ensure the safety of the planet. He becomes the leader of a government task force known as The Crusaders and hunts down super-powered individuals. In his off time, he raises his and Starfire's son, Jake, who soon develops his mother's powers and puts Dick at odds with the system he helped create. After allying with the Titans to help Jake escape, Dick tries to leave with his son, but Jake convinces him to aid the Titans and Superman in restoring the world's super-powers. Dick spent his remaining days watching his son grow into a responsible adult and teaching super-powered children how to control their abilities.

While much of the character's past remained the same, Dick's costume from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' was updated to a more modern look with short sleeves and long pants much like Tim Drake's original Robin outfit seen in ''Robin'' #1. While Grayson attended college at Gotham University, he dated [[Barbara Gordon]] but neither was aware of each other's secret identity despite having worked together.<ref>\"Batgirl Returns\"</ref><ref>''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''</ref> Dick eventually retired as Robin and left Gotham after coming to blows with Batman over the Dark Knight's controlling and ruthless behavior. Years later in ''The New Batman Adventures'', the character returned as Nightwing. His Nightwing costume looks identical to the one seen in ''Nightwing'' #1 in late 1996. While he would still work with Batman and Batgirl, he never fully reconciled with the two. Nightwing does, however, establish a strong working bond with his Robin successor [[Tim Drake]]. The character is occasionally referenced in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'',<ref>\"Spellbound\"</ref><ref>\"A Touch of Curar\u00e9\"</ref><ref name=\"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\">''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''</ref> He had non-speaking cameos on the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.\n* While the version of Robin of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series is never directly referred to be Dick Grayson in the cartoon, there are a number of elements of his character that point Dick to be the most likely candidate out of all the other Robins. This includes the color of his costume, a visual of two trapeze artists falling down in a circus tent when Raven was entering Robin's mind in the episode \"Haunted\", Robin becoming Nightwing in the episode \"How Long is Forever?\", his romantic relationship with Starfire, and the episode \"Fractured\" shows an alternate universe version of Robin with exactly the same DNA shows up named Nosyarg Kcid (Dick Grayson spelled backwards). The tie-in comic, ''Teen Titans Go!'' appears to confirm that this version of Robin is indeed Dick Grayson, as issue #47 focuses on Robin struggling through the anniversary of the death of his parents (which are shown to be the Flying Graysons as in the episode \"Haunted\") with the other Titans trying to help him cope. Batman makes a cameo overseeing Titans Tower from the city, and after seeing Robin and Starfire kiss, claims that Robin is \"in better hands\".<ref>''Teen Titans Go!'' #47</ref>\n[[File:Dick Grayson (The Batman).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dick Grayson in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' as Robin (left) and as Nightwing (right).]]\n\n* Dick Grayson appears as central part in the cast of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Evan Sabara]] (Robin) and by [[Jerry O'Connell]] (Nightwing). Introduced in the fourth season, after the 2003 ''Teen Titans'' TV series had ended, this version is an energetic, gifted 15-year old acrobat and one of the main attractions of Hayley's Circus, along with his parents as part of the amazing Flying Graysons act until [[Tony Zucco]] tried to threaten the Graysons into taking a 'protection' policy, resulting in an altercation where one of Zucco's brothers was easily defeated by Batman. When Zucco altered the Flying Graysons' trapeze act's rigs, Dick's parents fall to their deaths right in front of their son during a performance. With no surviving family members, Dick was taken in by Bruce Wayne. After the two worked together to capture Zucco, Dick chose the 'Robin' codename. Tensions arose when Robin and Batgirl met. While Batgirl has been Batman's wanna-be partner for some time, Robin appeared as Batman's new 'official partner' rather easily (presumably due to Bruce and Dick relating to losing parents). However, this changed when Batman took the liberty of revealing their respective identities and fully accepted each other into the fold. Afterward, Robin and Batgirl developed a more friendly, almost [[sibling]]-like working relationship, but Batgirl has romantic feelings for Robin. As depicted in the future, he has taken up the Nightwing mantle. However, Batman and Oracle still persist in calling Nightwing by his original codename. Batman did this more out of habit while Oracle did it as a flirting sort of way to annoy Nightwing. The character's Robin costume has elements of Tim Drake's two Robin costumes, but still resembles the Robin costume from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and is also influenced heavily by his ''Teen Titans'' counterpart. He is far less serious and genuinely enjoys his work as a vigilante, constantly spouting one-liners and generally acting as a typical teenager and his Golden Age comic counterpart. His Nightwing costume seen in the future resemble the modern costume while the Nightwing costume seen as Robin's online character for an online ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''-esque [[fighting game]] resembles the original design.\n* Dick Grayson appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Crawford Wilson]] (Nightwing) alongside [[Jeremy Shada]] (Robin) and [[Lex Lang]] (Batman). Robin's present-day costume is similar to the one Earth-Two Robin wore near the end of his career, Robin's younger costume is the classic Robin costume, and Nightwing's costume is a nod to the original 1984 version. In the episode \"The Color of Revenge!\", Robin and Batman team up when [[Crazy Quilt]] escapes prison to get revenge on Robin. This teamup takes place sometime after Robin has moved to [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]] and become an independent hero. The episode also has a flashback to his early days and an earlier encounter between the Dynamic Duo and Crazy Quilt. In the episode \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", Robin appears again along with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] facing off against [[Ra's al Ghul]]. At the end of the fight, Dick decides to go on his own as Nightwing. Nightwing is briefly seen in the first part of the episode \"Starro Lives\", where he is one of the many super-heroes whose mind is taken over by the villain [[Starro]]. Eventually, Nightwing is returned to normal like the others. In the teaser for \"Emperor Joker!\", Robin is seen in a flashback to an earlier battle between the Dynamic Duo and [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]. In the episode \"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\", he appears as Robin during a flashback and as Nightwing during the present time. During [[Batwoman]]'s thrill seeking crime fighting that occasionally endangering innocent bystanders, Robin helps Batman. Some years later, Nightwing and Batgirl help Batman (in Batwoman's body) reverse Batwoman's damage. In the episode \"The Knights of Tomorrow!\", he becomes Batman after Bruce Wayne retires and marries [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. After Bruce and Selina are killed by Joker Jr., Batman partners with [[Damian Wayne]] as the new Robin. In the opening for \"Triumvirate of Terror\", Robin was seen in the [[Justice League International]] playing [[baseball]] against the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]].\n* Dick Grayson appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/04/21/breaking-news-from-cartoon-network-warner-bros-animation-and-dc-entertainment/ | last=Hyde | first=David | title=Breaking News From Cartoon Network, Warner Bros.

When the series begins in 2010, Robin is 13 years old (the youngest on the Team but the most experienced). Grayson is forbidden by [[Batman]] to reveal his secret identity to the Team, wearing sunglasses when out of costume (although it appears later on that the original Team members became aware of his identity). He is known for making jokes during battles (such as his frequent use of the word \"whelming\", being a middle ground between \"overwhelming\" and \"underwhelming\") and is good with computers. His origin is the same as in the comics. After a simulated battle, Robin confesses to [[Black Canary]] that he can't dedicate himself completely to 'the mission', realizing that he doesn't want to be like Batman anymore. Grayson is shown to be a strong detective, able to work under pressure, and gains leadership experience throughout the first season. He develops a crush on [[Zatanna]], the culmination of which is a kiss on New Year's Eve. He transitions into Nightwing during ''Young Justice: Invasion''. During the five-year gap between seasons, he allows Jason Todd and Tim Drake to be successors as Robin. He is shown to be a member of the Bat-Family, implying a non-confrontational transition to Nightwing. Nightwing chooses to remain with the Team, rejecting an invitation to join the [[Justice League]]. He acts as team leader and deploys squads on missions (similarly to Batman in Season 1). At the end of Season 2, he chooses to take a leave of absence from the team (returning leadership to [[Aqualad]]), citing that everything happening is 'business as usual'. By Season 3, which begins 2 years later, Grayson is in a relationship with [[Barbara Gordon]], with the latter now assuming her identity of Oracle. His Robin costume is similar to his \"New 52\" costume but designed more practically for urban combat. His Nightwing costume is similar to his third costume from the comics, enhanced with protective gear. This television series is not a direct translation of the ''[[Young Justice]]'' comic book series of the same name or any [[Teen Titans]] storylines, incorporating elements from multiple sources to tell a unique story allowing participation from multiple Robins.\n* A Nightwing animated series was in development for Cartoon Network, but was turned down in favor of ''Young Justice''.<ref>https://io9.gizmodo.com/5932140/artwork-from-scrapped-nightwing-cartoon-shows-off-dc-heroes-legend-of-korra-style/</ref>\n* Dick Grayson's Nightwing costume from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' appears as an easter egg in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' in the episode \"Play Date\".\n\n===Film===\n{{Very long|section|date=April 2017}}\n====Live action====\n=====Serials=====\n* [[Douglas Croft]] portrayed Robin in the 1943 serial ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', which dealt with Batman and Robin's struggle against Dr. Daka, a Japanese scientist who invented a device that turns people into pseudo-zombies.\n* In the 1949 sequel ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', actor [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]] took over the role.

Director [[Tim Burton]] planned to cast actor [[Ricky Addison Reed]] as Robin, but later felt it was unimportant to the story and cut Robin out altogether. [[Kiefer Sutherland]] had also turned down the role, despite being unaware of the film's tone and direction. [[Marlon Wayans]] was originally cast as Robin in the 1992 film ''[[Batman Returns]]'',<ref name=MarlonAV>{{cite web| last=Rabin | first=Nathan | url=https://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012133912/http://avclub.com/content/node/23240| url-status= dead| archivedate= 12 October 2007|date= 25 February 1998| title=Marlon Wayans | publisher=The A.V.

In an earlier script of ''Batman Returns'', he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help Batman following his narrow escape when the Penguin tried to kill him. He would later play a crucial role in Batman's final confrontation with the Penguin. In that script, he was simply called Robin and has no known real name. He was considered for the role in ''[[Batman Forever]]'', but the change in directors from [[Tim Burton]] to [[Joel Schumacher]] would also mean a change in the choice of actor for the role of Robin. Despite not actually appearing in either film, he was reportedly still paid for the role.<ref name=MarlonAV />\n* Dick Grayson is played by actor [[Chris O'Donnell]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]). In the film series, Richard \"Dick\" Grayson is in his mid-to-late teens, and is the younger of two brothers, and the \"Flying Graysons\" act being a family quartet (instead of a trio). Grayson's parents and older brother died after helping to foil [[Two-Face]]'s plan to hold the Social Elite of Gotham City at a Circus charity fundraiser with a bomb. Their deaths were caused when Two-Face shot out the supports for the scaffolding they were hanging on to and they fell to their deaths, the safety net having been removed earlier in their performance. Following their deaths, Dick is taken in as a ward of Bruce Wayne's, although Dick is more interested in taking on and out Two-Face by himself. Suspicious of Bruce's and Alfred Pennyworth's behavior around a certain door they keep locked, Dick ends up finding his way into the [[Batcave]]. Having discovered Wayne's identity as Batman, Dick insists on becoming a crime-fighter himself, taking on the name \"Robin\", an old nickname courtesy of his late father and older brother, and collaborating with Batman to defeat Riddler and Two-Face and avenge his family. Before taking on the name Robin, Dick considers \"Nightwing\" as a possibility.\n* In the [[1997 in film|1997]] sequel ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', Chris O'Donnell reprised the role of Robin. His costume is changed to resemble Nightwing's in the comics, but continues to be \"Robin.\" In the film, he's sick of being in Bruce's shadow and is constantly at odds with Batman thanks to Poison Ivy's powers. Ivy's seduction and pheromones cause Robin to fall blindingly in love with her, and Batman's attempts to stop the two from kissing cause Robin to believe he is jealous, allowing Ivy to tear the duo apart. Robin eventually decides to go solo and prepares to leave to see Ivy when he sees a \"robin-signal\" in the sky, with Batman begging him to trust him about Ivy one more time. Robin arrives at Ivy's lair and convinces her to tell him her plan as a sign of trust. The two share a kiss, but Robin reveals he has covered his lips in rubber, just in case Ivy really was trying to kill him. Ivy, enraged Robin tricked her ''and'' stole a kiss from her, shoves him into her pond to drown him, but he eventually cuts himself free of the vines. He and Batman, now joined by Batgirl, managed to save the city from Mr. Freeze, and after revealing that Ivy was the one who tried to kill Freeze's wife, he gives them a cure for Alfred, who was greatly sick. The trio agree to continue working together, as a family.\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\nIn February 2017, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] is developing a Nightwing live action movie centered on the character set in the [[DC Extended Universe]] with [[Bill Dubuque]] writing the script and ''[[The Lego Batman Movie|The LEGO Batman Movie]]'' director [[Chris McKay]] signed on as director.

During the climax, he briefly dons a Batman armor labeled \"Nightwing\" when attempting to save Barbara Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth.\n\n=====Direct-to-video releases=====\n* Robin appears in the [[direct-to-video]] animated movie ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'', voiced by [[Shane Haboucha]]. In his first appearance in his original costume since the end of ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'', this version apparently was adopted as a teenager after Batman realizes that he is frightening the innocent, instead of being adopted as a child; the circumstances surrounding their meeting are not shown. Robin thought that [[Superman]] was cool and showed great skills in acrobatics in the [[Batcave]].\n* Nightwing appears in the feature film ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. This version is already Nightwing but is alluded as the first version of Robin before [[Jason Todd]]. At the story's start, Nightwing takes down two minor thugs, one of whom knows that Nightwing was once Robin as does the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Nightwing later assists Batman in pursuing the Red Hood but is injured in an explosion set by Red Hood. While being bandaged by [[Alfred Pennyworth]] in the Batcave, he insists on helping Batman but is unable due to his injury and is told to go home but not before he is thanked by the Dark Knight for his help, which surprises him. Nightwing is also seen in the film's epilogue hearing reports of the Joker's arrest.\n* Robin appears in ''[[JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time]]'', voiced by [[Jack DeSena]]. The movie was intended to be a reboot, of sorts, of the classic ''Super Friends'' series, in which Dick Grayson joins Batman and various heroes, the [[Justice League]] in this case, on adventures. Robin plays a supporting role, and acts as somewhat of a foil to the two future [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] members, [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Dawnstar]]. Robin is shown to have a close relationship to Batman, although he tends to ignore his orders.\n* The [[DC Animated Movie Universe]] version of Dick Grayson (voiced by [[Sean Maher]]) appears in ''[[Son of Batman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2014/02/world-premiere-of-son-of-batman-animated-feature-confirmed-for-wondercon-anaheim-2014/|title=World Premiere Of \"Son Of Batman\" Animated Feature Confirmed For WonderCon Anaheim 2014|last=Harvey|first=Jim|publisher=World's Finest Online|date=March 8, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/animated-batman-robin-movie-finds-763553|title=Animated 'Batman vs. Robin' Movie It's Voice Cast (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/nycc-cast-of-batman-bad-blood-reveal-first-footage|title=NYCC: Cast of \"Batman: Bad Blood\" Reveal First Footage|last=Manning|first=Shaun|date=9 October 2015|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/animated-justice-league-vs-teen-titans-feature-reveals-voice-cast|title=Animated \"Justice League vs. Teen Titans\" Feature Reveals Voice Cast|date=18 January 2016|website=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'', ''[[Batman: Hush (film)|Batman: Hush]]'', and ''[[Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/teen-titans-judas-contract-movie-sets-voice-cast-965621|title=Christina Ricci, Miguel Ferrer Join Voice Cast of 'Teen Titans' Animated Movie (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 19, 2017}}</ref> Dick initially appears as Nightwing in ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin''.

It can also be seen as the bony frame work of the body which provides support, shape and protection to the soft [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and delicate organs in animals. There are several different skeletal types: the [[exoskeleton]], which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the [[endoskeleton]], which forms the support structure inside the body, the [[hydroskeleton]], a flexible skeleton supported by fluid pressure, and the [[cytoskeleton]] present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria, and archaea. The term comes {{ety|el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (skelet\u00f3s)|dried up}}.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of English 2nd edition 2005</ref> Charli D\u2019Amelio waz here \n\n==Types of skeletons==\nThere are two major types of skeletons: solid and fluid. Solid skeletons can be internal, called an [[endoskeleton]], or external, called an [[exoskeleton]], and may be further classified as '''pliant''' (elastic/movable) or '''rigid''' (hard/non-movable).<ref name=\"Barnes et al\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Edward E.|last2=Fox|first2=Richard S.|last3=Barnes|first3=Robert D.|title=Invertebrate zoology : a functional evolutionary approach|date=2003|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=0-03-025982-7|edition=7.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821}}</ref> Fluid skeletons are always internal.\n\n===Exoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Exoskeleton}}\n[[Image:Hym-myrmicinae.gif|thumb|[[Exoskeleton]] of an [[ant]]]]\n\n[[Exoskeleton]]s are external, and are found in many [[invertebrate]]s; they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body. Some kinds of exoskeletons undergo periodic [[moult]]ing or [[ecdysis]] as the animal grows, as is the case in many [[arthropod]]s including insects and [[crustacean]]s.\n\nThe exoskeleton of insects is not only a form of protection, but also serves as a surface for muscle attachment, as a watertight protection against drying, and as a sense organ to interact with the environment. The [[mollusc shell|shell]] of mollusks also performs all of the same functions, except that in most cases it does not contain sense organs.\n\nAn external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal, so on land, organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small. Somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater. The [[southern giant clam]], a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the Pacific Ocean, has a shell that is massive in both size and weight. ''[[Syrinx aruanus]]'' is a species of sea snail with a very large shell.\n\n===Endoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Endoskeleton}}\n[[Image:Eptesicus fuscus skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[Endoskeleton]] of a [[bat]].]]\n[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|A [[beaver]] skeleton on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.]]\n\nThe [[endoskeleton]] is the internal support structure of an animal, composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] and is typical of [[vertebrate]]s. Endoskeletons vary in complexity from functioning purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), to serving as an attachment site for muscles and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a skeleton is present in [[echinoderms]] and [[chordate]]s.\n\n===Pliant skeletons===\n\nPliant skeletons are capable of movement; thus, when [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] is applied to the skeletal structure, it deforms and then reverts to its original shape. This skeletal structure is used in some invertebrates, for instance in the hinge of [[bivalve shell]]s or the [[mesoglea]] of [[cnidarians]] such as [[jellyfish]]. Pliant skeletons are beneficial because only [[muscle]] contractions are needed to bend the skeleton; upon muscle relaxation, the skeleton will return to its original shape. [[Cartilage]] is one material that a pliant skeleton may be composed of, but most pliant skeletons are formed from a mixture of [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]], and water.<ref name=\"Barnes et al\" /> For additional structure or protection, pliant skeletons may be supported by rigid skeletons. Organisms that have pliant skeletons typically live in water, which supports body structure in the absence of a rigid skeleton.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pechenik|first1=Jan A.|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352418-4|edition=Seventh}}</ref>\n\n===Rigid skeletons===\n\nRigid skeletons are not capable of movement when stressed, creating a strong support system most common in [[terrestrial animals]]. Such a skeleton type used by animals that live in water are more for protection (such as [[barnacle]] and [[snail]] shells) or for fast-moving animals that require additional support of musculature needed for swimming through water. Rigid skeletons are formed from materials including [[chitin]] (in arthropods), [[calcium]] compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[stony coral]]s and [[mollusk]]s) and [[silicate]] (for [[diatom]]s and [[radiolarian]]s).\n\n===Cytoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Cytoskeleton}}\nThe cytoskeleton (gr. ''kytos'' = cell) is used to stabilize and preserve the form of the cells. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular motion (using structures such as [[flagella]], [[cilia]] and [[lamellipodia]]), and plays important roles in both intracellular transport (the movement of [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and [[organelle]]s, for example) and cellular division.\n\n===Fluid skeletons===\n\n==== Hydrostatic skeleton (hydroskeleton) ====\n{{Main article|Hydrostatic skeleton}}\nA hydrostatic skeleton is a semi-rigid, soft tissue structure filled with liquid under pressure, surrounded by muscles. Longitudinal and circular muscles around their body sectors allow movement by alternate lengthening and contractions along their lengths. A common example of this is the [[earthworm]].\n\n==Organisms with skeletons==\n\n===Invertebrates===\nThe endoskeletons of echinoderms and some other soft-bodied [[invertebrate]]s such as [[jellyfish]] and [[earthworms]] are also termed [[hydrostatic skeleton|hydrostatic]]; a body cavity the [[coelom]] is filled with [[coelom#fluid|coelomic fluid]] and the pressure from this fluid acts together with the surrounding muscles to change the organism's shape and produce movement.\n\n====Sponges====\nThe skeleton of [[sponge]]s consists of microscopic [[calcareous]] or [[silicious]] [[Sponge spicule|spicules]]. The [[demosponge]]s include 90% of all species of [[sponge]]s. Their \"skeletons\" are made of [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]] consisting of fibers of the protein [[spongin]], the mineral [[silica]], or both. Where spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar [[Hexactinellida|glass sponges]].<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 105\u2013106|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\n====Echinoderms====\nThe skeleton of the [[echinoderm]]s, which include, among other things, the [[starfish]], is composed of [[calcite]] and a small amount of [[magnesium oxide]]. It lies below the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in the [[mesoderm]] and is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm and at the same time light. It coalesces into small [[calcareous]] ossicles (bony plates), which can grow in all directions and thus can replace the loss of a body part. Connected by joints, the individual skeletal parts can be moved by the muscles.\n\n===Vertebrates===\n[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|'''Pithecometra''':  From [[Thomas Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', the compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]\n\nIn most vertebrates, the main skeletal component is referred to as [[bone]]. These bones compose a unique skeletal system for each type of animal. Another important component is cartilage which in mammals is found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the [[shark]]s, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage. The [[segmentation (biology)|segmental]] pattern of the skeleton is present in all vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) with basic units being repeated. This segmental pattern is particularly evident in the vertebral column and the ribcage.\n\nBones in addition to supporting the body also serve, at the cellular level, as calcium and phosphate storage.\n\n====Fish====\n{{Main article|Fish anatomy}}\n\nThe skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the ([[Chondrichthyes]]), or bones as in the ([[Osteichthyes]]). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. They are supported only by the muscles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fin (tail fin), have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.\n\n====Birds====\n{{Main article|Bird anatomy}}\n\nThe bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to withstand the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single [[ossification]]s, such as the [[pygostyle]]. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true [[jaw]], instead having evolved a [[beak]], which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an [[egg tooth]], which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.\n\n====Marine mammals====\n[[File:Zalophus californianus 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Californian sea lion]]]]\nTo facilitate the movement of [[marine mammal]]s in water, the hind legs were either lost altogether, as in the whales and [[manatee]]s, or united in a single [[fish fin|tail fin]] as in the [[pinnipeds]] (seals). In the whale, the [[cervical vertebrae]] are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521114304/http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812000655/http://whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Humans====\n{{Main article|Human skeleton}}\n[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nThe human skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[muscle]]s and [[cartilage]]. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, [[human lung|lungs]], [[human heart|heart]] and [[spinal cord]]. Although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly found in bones, the teeth are usually considered as members of the skeletal system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|title=Skeletal System: Facts, Function & Diseases|work=Live Science|access-date=7 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123921/http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=}}</ref>\nThe biggest bone in the body is the [[femur]] in the upper leg, and the smallest is the [[stapes]] bone in the [[middle ear]].

The [[hyoid bone]], which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the [[tongue]], does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.\n\nThere are 206 bones in the adult human skeleton, although this number depends on whether the pelvic bones (the [[hip bone]]s on each side) are counted as one or three bones on each side (ilium, ischium, and pubis), whether the coccyx or tail bone is counted as one or four separate bones, and does not count the variable [[wormian bone]]s between skull sutures. Similarly, the sacrum is usually counted as a single bone, rather than five fused vertebrae. There is also a variable number of small sesamoid bones, commonly found in tendons. The patella or kneecap on each side is an example of a larger sesamoid bone. The patellae are counted in the total, as they are constant. The number of bones varies between individuals and with age \u2013 newborn babies have over 270 bones<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.groundreport.com/were-born-with-270-bones-as-adults-we-have-206/\n |title       = We\u2019re Born With 270 Bones.

In many animals, the skeleton bones contain [[Bone marrow|marrow]], which produces blood cells.\n\nThere exist several general differences between the male and female skeletons. The male skeleton, for example, is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. In the female skeleton, the bones of the skull are generally less angular. The female skeleton also has wider and shorter breastbone and slimmer wrists. There exist significant differences between the male and female pelvis which are related to the female's pregnancy and childbirth capabilities. The female pelvis is wider and shallower than the male pelvis. Female pelvises also have an enlarged pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet. The angle between the pubic bones is known to be sharper in males, which results in a more circular, narrower, and near heart-shaped pelvis.<ref name=\"Balaban-61\">{{cite book | title = The Handy Anatomy Answer Book | first = Naomi| last = Balaban| page = 61 | year = 2008 | publisher = Visible Ink Press| isbn = 978-1-57859-190-9\n}}</ref><ref name=\"-73\">{{cite book| title = Body The Complete Human: How It Grows, How It Works, And How to Keep It Healthy And Strong| first = Lisa| last = Stein| page = [https://archive.org/details/bodycompletehuma0000unse/page/73 73]| year = 2007| publisher = National Geographic Society| isbn = 978-1-4262-0128-8| url = https://archive.org/details/bodycompletehuma0000unse/page/73}}</ref>\n\n==Bones and cartilage==\n\n===Bone===\n{{Main article|Bone}}\n\nBones are rigid [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that form part of the [[endoskeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense [[connective tissue]]. Bones have a variety of shapes with a complex internal and external structure they are also lightweight, yet strong and hard. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone tissue is [[mineralized tissue]] and this\ngives it rigidity and a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb-like]] three-dimensional internal structure.

Appleton-Century | page = 31}}</ref>\n\n===Cartilage===\n{{Main article|Cartilage}}\n\nDuring [[embryogenesis]] the precursor to bone development is cartilage. Much of this substance is then replaced by bone during the second and third trimester, after the flesh such as muscle has formed around it; forming the skeleton. Cartilage is a stiff and inflexible [[connective tissue]] found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between bones, the [[rib cage]], the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the [[bronchial tubes]] and the [[intervertebral disc]]s. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than [[muscle]].\n\nCartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of [[extracellular matrix]] composed of Type II [[collagen]] (except Fibrocartilage which also contains type I collagen) fibers, abundant [[ground substance]] rich in [[proteoglycan]], and [[elastin]] fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, [[elastic cartilage]], [[hyaline cartilage]] and [[fibrocartilage]], which differ in the relative amounts of these three main components.\n\nUnlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels.

It can also be seen as the bony frame work of the body which provides support, shape and protection to the soft [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and delicate organs in animals. There are several different skeletal types: the [[exoskeleton]], which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the [[endoskeleton]], which forms the support structure inside the body, the [[hydroskeleton]], a flexible skeleton supported by fluid pressure, and the [[cytoskeleton]] present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria, and archaea. The term comes {{ety|el|\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (skelet\u00f3s)|dried up}}.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of English 2nd edition 2005</ref>\n\n==Types of skeletons==\nThere are two major types of skeletons: solid and fluid. Solid skeletons can be internal, called an [[endoskeleton]], or external, called an [[exoskeleton]], and may be further classified as '''pliant''' (elastic/movable) or '''rigid''' (hard/non-movable).<ref name=\"Barnes et al\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Edward E.|last2=Fox|first2=Richard S.|last3=Barnes|first3=Robert D.|title=Invertebrate zoology : a functional evolutionary approach|date=2003|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=0-03-025982-7|edition=7.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821}}</ref> Fluid skeletons are always internal.\n\n===Exoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Exoskeleton}}\n[[Image:Hym-myrmicinae.gif|thumb|[[Exoskeleton]] of an [[ant]]]]\n\n[[Exoskeleton]]s are external, and are found in many [[invertebrate]]s; they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body. Some kinds of exoskeletons undergo periodic [[moult]]ing or [[ecdysis]] as the animal grows, as is the case in many [[arthropod]]s including insects and [[crustacean]]s.\n\nThe exoskeleton of insects is not only a form of protection, but also serves as a surface for muscle attachment, as a watertight protection against drying, and as a sense organ to interact with the environment. The [[mollusc shell|shell]] of mollusks also performs all of the same functions, except that in most cases it does not contain sense organs.\n\nAn external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal, so on land, organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small. Somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater. The [[southern giant clam]], a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the Pacific Ocean, has a shell that is massive in both size and weight. ''[[Syrinx aruanus]]'' is a species of sea snail with a very large shell.\n\n===Endoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Endoskeleton}}\n[[Image:Eptesicus fuscus skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[Endoskeleton]] of a [[bat]].]]\n[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|A [[beaver]] skeleton on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.]]\n\nThe [[endoskeleton]] is the internal support structure of an animal, composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] and is typical of [[vertebrate]]s. Endoskeletons vary in complexity from functioning purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), to serving as an attachment site for muscles and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a skeleton is present in [[echinoderms]] and [[chordate]]s.\n\n===Pliant skeletons===\n\nPliant skeletons are capable of movement; thus, when [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] is applied to the skeletal structure, it deforms and then reverts to its original shape. This skeletal structure is used in some invertebrates, for instance in the hinge of [[bivalve shell]]s or the [[mesoglea]] of [[cnidarians]] such as [[jellyfish]]. Pliant skeletons are beneficial because only [[muscle]] contractions are needed to bend the skeleton; upon muscle relaxation, the skeleton will return to its original shape. [[Cartilage]] is one material that a pliant skeleton may be composed of, but most pliant skeletons are formed from a mixture of [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]], and water.<ref name=\"Barnes et al\" /> For additional structure or protection, pliant skeletons may be supported by rigid skeletons. Organisms that have pliant skeletons typically live in water, which supports body structure in the absence of a rigid skeleton.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pechenik|first1=Jan A.|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352418-4|edition=Seventh}}</ref>\n\n===Rigid skeletons===\n\nRigid skeletons are not capable of movement when stressed, creating a strong support system most common in [[terrestrial animals]]. Such a skeleton type used by animals that live in water are more for protection (such as [[barnacle]] and [[snail]] shells) or for fast-moving animals that require additional support of musculature needed for swimming through water. Rigid skeletons are formed from materials including [[chitin]] (in arthropods), [[calcium]] compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[stony coral]]s and [[mollusk]]s) and [[silicate]] (for [[diatom]]s and [[radiolarian]]s).\n\n===Cytoskeleton===\n{{Main article|Cytoskeleton}}\nThe cytoskeleton (gr. ''kytos'' = cell) is used to stabilize and preserve the form of the cells. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular motion (using structures such as [[flagella]], [[cilia]] and [[lamellipodia]]), and plays important roles in both intracellular transport (the movement of [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and [[organelle]]s, for example) and cellular division.\n\n===Fluid skeletons===\n\n==== Hydrostatic skeleton (hydroskeleton) ====\n{{Main article|Hydrostatic skeleton}}\nA hydrostatic skeleton is a semi-rigid, soft tissue structure filled with liquid under pressure, surrounded by muscles. Longitudinal and circular muscles around their body sectors allow movement by alternate lengthening and contractions along their lengths. A common example of this is the [[earthworm]].\n\n==Organisms with skeletons==\n\n===Invertebrates===\nThe endoskeletons of echinoderms and some other soft-bodied [[invertebrate]]s such as [[jellyfish]] and [[earthworms]] are also termed [[hydrostatic skeleton|hydrostatic]]; a body cavity the [[coelom]] is filled with [[coelom#fluid|coelomic fluid]] and the pressure from this fluid acts together with the surrounding muscles to change the organism's shape and produce movement.\n\n====Sponges====\nThe skeleton of [[sponge]]s consists of microscopic [[calcareous]] or [[silicious]] [[Sponge spicule|spicules]]. The [[demosponge]]s include 90% of all species of [[sponge]]s. Their \"skeletons\" are made of [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]] consisting of fibers of the protein [[spongin]], the mineral [[silica]], or both. Where spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar [[Hexactinellida|glass sponges]].<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia|pages= 105\u2013106|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\n====Echinoderms====\nThe skeleton of the [[echinoderm]]s, which include, among other things, the [[starfish]], is composed of [[calcite]] and a small amount of [[magnesium oxide]]. It lies below the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in the [[mesoderm]] and is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm and at the same time light. It coalesces into small [[calcareous]] ossicles (bony plates), which can grow in all directions and thus can replace the loss of a body part. Connected by joints, the individual skeletal parts can be moved by the muscles.\n\n===Vertebrates===\n[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|'''Pithecometra''':  From [[Thomas Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', the compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]\n\nIn most vertebrates, the main skeletal component is referred to as [[bone]]. These bones compose a unique skeletal system for each type of animal. Another important component is cartilage which in mammals is found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the [[shark]]s, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage. The [[segmentation (biology)|segmental]] pattern of the skeleton is present in all vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) with basic units being repeated. This segmental pattern is particularly evident in the vertebral column and the ribcage.\n\nBones in addition to supporting the body also serve, at the cellular level, as calcium and phosphate storage.\n\n====Fish====\n{{Main article|Fish anatomy}}\n\nThe skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the ([[Chondrichthyes]]), or bones as in the ([[Osteichthyes]]). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. They are supported only by the muscles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fin (tail fin), have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.\n\n====Birds====\n{{Main article|Bird anatomy}}\n\nThe bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to withstand the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single [[ossification]]s, such as the [[pygostyle]]. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true [[jaw]], instead having evolved a [[beak]], which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an [[egg tooth]], which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.\n\n====Marine mammals====\n[[File:Zalophus californianus 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Californian sea lion]]]]\nTo facilitate the movement of [[marine mammal]]s in water, the hind legs were either lost altogether, as in the whales and [[manatee]]s, or united in a single [[fish fin|tail fin]] as in the [[pinnipeds]] (seals). In the whale, the [[cervical vertebrae]] are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521114304/http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812000655/http://whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Humans====\n{{Main article|Human skeleton}}\n[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nThe human skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[muscle]]s and [[cartilage]]. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, [[human lung|lungs]], [[human heart|heart]] and [[spinal cord]]. Although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly found in bones, the teeth are usually considered as members of the skeletal system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|title=Skeletal System: Facts, Function & Diseases|work=Live Science|access-date=7 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123921/http://www.livescience.com/22537-skeletal-system.html|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=}}</ref>\nThe biggest bone in the body is the [[femur]] in the upper leg, and the smallest is the [[stapes]] bone in the [[middle ear]].

The [[hyoid bone]], which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the [[tongue]], does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.\n\nThere are 206 bones in the adult human skeleton, although this number depends on whether the pelvic bones (the [[hip bone]]s on each side) are counted as one or three bones on each side (ilium, ischium, and pubis), whether the coccyx or tail bone is counted as one or four separate bones, and does not count the variable [[wormian bone]]s between skull sutures. Similarly, the sacrum is usually counted as a single bone, rather than five fused vertebrae. There is also a variable number of small sesamoid bones, commonly found in tendons. The patella or kneecap on each side is an example of a larger sesamoid bone. The patellae are counted in the total, as they are constant. The number of bones varies between individuals and with age \u2013 newborn babies have over 270 bones<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.groundreport.com/were-born-with-270-bones-as-adults-we-have-206/\n |title       = We\u2019re Born With 270 Bones.

In many animals, the skeleton bones contain [[Bone marrow|marrow]], which produces blood cells.\n\nThere exist several general differences between the male and female skeletons. The male skeleton, for example, is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. In the female skeleton, the bones of the skull are generally less angular. The female skeleton also has wider and shorter breastbone and slimmer wrists. There exist significant differences between the male and female pelvis which are related to the female's pregnancy and childbirth capabilities. The female pelvis is wider and shallower than the male pelvis. Female pelvises also have an enlarged pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet. The angle between the pubic bones is known to be sharper in males, which results in a more circular, narrower, and near heart-shaped pelvis.<ref name=\"Balaban-61\">{{cite book | title = The Handy Anatomy Answer Book | first = Naomi| last = Balaban| page = 61 | year = 2008 | publisher = Visible Ink Press| isbn = 978-1-57859-190-9\n}}</ref><ref name=\"-73\">{{cite book| title = Body The Complete Human: How It Grows, How It Works, And How to Keep It Healthy And Strong| first = Lisa| last = Stein| page = [https://archive.org/details/bodycompletehuma0000unse/page/73 73]| year = 2007| publisher = National Geographic Society| isbn = 978-1-4262-0128-8| url = https://archive.org/details/bodycompletehuma0000unse/page/73}}</ref>\n\n==Bones and cartilage==\n\n===Bone===\n{{Main article|Bone}}\n\nBones are rigid [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that form part of the [[endoskeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s.

Bone tissue is a type of dense [[connective tissue]]. Bones have a variety of shapes with a complex internal and external structure they are also lightweight, yet strong and hard. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone tissue is [[mineralized tissue]] and this\ngives it rigidity and a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb-like]] three-dimensional internal structure.

Much of this substance is then replaced by bone during the second and third trimester, after the flesh such as muscle has formed around it; forming the skeleton. Cartilage is a stiff and inflexible [[connective tissue]] found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between bones, the [[rib cage]], the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the [[bronchial tubes]] and the [[intervertebral disc]]s. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than [[muscle]].\n\nCartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of [[extracellular matrix]] composed of Type II [[collagen]] (except Fibrocartilage which also contains type I collagen) fibers, abundant [[ground substance]] rich in [[proteoglycan]], and [[elastin]] fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, [[elastic cartilage]], [[hyaline cartilage]] and [[fibrocartilage]], which differ in the relative amounts of these three main components.\n\nUnlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by diffusion, helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.\n\n== Culture ==\nIn [[Western culture]], the skeleton is oftentimes seen as a fearful [[symbols of death|symbol of death]] and the [[paranormal]].
