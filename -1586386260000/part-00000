{"title_page": "List of cathedrals in Italy", "text_new": "[[File:Il Duomo Florence Italy.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Florence Cathedral]]]]\n\nThis is a '''list of cathedrals in Italy''', including also [[Vatican City]] and [[San Marino]]. This is intended to be a complete list of extant [[cathedral]]s \u2013 i.e., churches that are the seats of bishops \u2013 and [[co-cathedral]]s. Many former cathedrals and [[proto-cathedral]]s are also included, but many more are yet to be added.\n\nAlmost all cathedrals in Italy are [[Roman Catholic]], but any that are not are also listed here.<ref>so far comprising two [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church|Italo-Albanian Catholic]] cathedrals, in Lungro and Piana degli Albanesi, and the [[Greek Orthodox]] cathedral in Venice; there may be one or two others</ref>\n\nThere are many churches in Italy commonly known as ''[[Duomo]]''. This is often translated as \"cathedral\", but not entirely accurately: \"duomo\" refers to the principal church of a town or city, whatever its status. Clearly, when a cathedral exists, that will often also be a town's principal church, and many cathedrals are thus also \"duomi\", and vice versa. This is not always so, however: there are places where the cathedral and the principal church are not the same (Bologna, for example); and very many places which are not the seats of bishops have a non-episcopal \"duomo\" and no cathedral at all. In this list, churches known as \"duomo\" are only included if they are, or have been, episcopal seats, as above.\n\nThere is a very small number of churches, such as that at Monza, which have such exceptional distinction or status that they are comparable in importance to cathedrals without having ever been the seats of bishops, and are commonly known in English as cathedrals. There is a separate (incomplete) list for this small group of churches.\n\n==List of cathedrals in Italy==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!<small>Cathedral</small>!!<small>Present Archdiocese<br>or Diocese</small>!!<small>Location</small>!!<small>Dedication</small>!!<small>Status</small>!!<small>Notes</small>\n|-\n| [[Acerenza Cathedral]]<br>''Cattedrale dell\u2019Assunzione della B.

This is intended to be a complete list of extant [[cathedral]]s \u2013 i.e., churches that are the seats of bishops \u2013 and [[co-cathedral]]s. Many former cathedrals and [[proto-cathedral]]s are also included, but many more are yet to be added.\n\nAlmost all cathedrals in Italy are [[Roman Catholic]], but any that are not are also listed here.<ref>so far comprising two [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church|Italo-Albanian Catholic]] cathedrals, in Lungro and Piana degli Albanesi, and the [[Greek Orthodox]] cathedral in Venice; there may be one or two others</ref>\n\nThere are many churches in Italy commonly known as ''[[Duomo]]''. This is often translated as \"cathedral\", but not entirely accurately: \"duomo\" refers to the principal church of a town or city, whatever its status. Clearly, when a cathedral exists, that will often also be a town's principal church, and many cathedrals are thus also \"duomi\", and vice versa. This is not always so, however: there are places where the cathedral and the principal church are not the same (Bologna, for example); and very many places which are not the seats of bishops have a non-episcopal \"duomo\" and no cathedral at all. In this list, churches known as \"duomo\" are only included if they are, or have been, episcopal seats, as above.\n\nThere is a very small number of churches, such as that at Monza, which have such exceptional distinction or status that they are comparable in importance to cathedrals without having ever been the seats of bishops, and are commonly known in English as cathedrals. There is a separate (incomplete) list for this small group of churches.\n\n==List of cathedrals in Italy==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!<small>Cathedral</small>!!<small>Present Archdiocese<br>or Diocese</small>!!<small>Location</small>!!<small>Dedication</small>!!<small>Status</small>!!<small>Notes</small>\n|-\n| [[Acerenza Cathedral]]<br>''Cattedrale dell\u2019Assunzione della B.

The devices, designed as small [[dongle]]s, enable users with a [[mobile device]] or [[personal computer]] to play Internet-[[streaming media|streamed]] audio-visual content on a [[high-definition television]] or [[home audio]] system through [[mobile app|mobile]] and [[web app]]s that support the [[Google Cast]] technology. Alternatively, content can be mirrored from the [[Google Chrome]] web browser running on a personal computer, as well as from the screen of some [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nThe first-generation Chromecast, a video streaming device, was announced on July 24, 2013, and made available for purchase on the same day in the United States for US$35.<ref name=\"Forbes: Chromecast\">{{cite web|last=Evangelho|first=Jason|title=Google's Chromecast A Brilliant Play For The Living Room -- Especially With $35 Price Tag|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/07/24/googles-chromecast-a-brilliant-play-for-the-living-room-especially-with-35-price-tag/|accessdate=July 24, 2013|work=[[Forbes.com]]|date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> The second-generation Chromecast and an audio-only model called Chromecast Audio were released in September 2015. A model called Chromecast Ultra that supports [[4K resolution]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] was released in November 2016. A third generation of the HD video Chromecast was released in October 2018.\n\nCritics praised the Chromecast's simplicity and potential for future app support. The Google Cast [[Software development kit|SDK]] was released on February 3, 2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to work with Chromecast and other Cast receivers. According to Google, over 20,000 Google Cast\u2013ready apps are available, as of May 2015. Over 30&nbsp;million units have sold globally since launch, making the Chromecast the best-selling streaming device in the United States in 2014, according to [[NPD Group]]. From Chromecast's launch to May 2015, it handled more than 1.5 billion stream requests.\n\n==Development==\nAccording to Google, the Chromecast was originally conceived by engineer Majd Bakar. His inspiration for the product came around 2008 after noticing the film-viewing tendencies of his wife Carla Hindie. Using her laptop, she would search for a film to watch on a [[Streaming media|streaming]] service and add it to her queue, before closing her laptop and using a gaming device to play the film on a television. She took these steps because she found television interfaces difficult to use to search for content. Bakar found the whole process inefficient and wanted to build a phone-based interface that would allow video to play on a large display through a small hardware device. After joining Google in 2011 to work on products that \"would change how people used their TVs\", Bakar pitched the idea for the Chromecast. Development on the product began in 2012; late that year, Bakar brought home a [[Beta release|beta version]] of the product for Hindie to test. The device was launched in July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/products/chromecast/heres-five-years-chromecast/|title=Here's to five years of Chromecast|website=blog.google.com|first=Hemal|last=Shah|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Features and operation==\n{{Main|Google Cast#Operation}}\n[[File:Chromecast plugged into TV.jpg|thumb|left|A first-generation Chromecast plugged into the HDMI port of a TV]]\nChromecast offers two methods to stream content: the first employs [[mobile app|mobile]] and [[web apps]] that support the [[Google Cast]] technology; the second allows mirroring of content from the web browser [[Google Chrome]] running on a personal computer, as well as content displayed on some Android devices.<ref name=\"SydneyMornHerald\">{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Adam|title=Hands on: Chromecast Android screen mirroring|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/gadgets-on-the-go/hands-on-chromecast-android-screen-mirroring-20140713-zt68u.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> In both cases, playback is initiated through the \"cast\" button on the sender device.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/10744999/Should-I-buy-Google-Chromecast.html|title=Should I buy Google Chromecast?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=Rick|last=Maybury|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen no content is streamed, video-capable Chromecasts display a user-personalizable content feed called \"Backdrop\" that can include featured and personal photos, artwork, weather, satellite images, weather forecasts, and news.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-chromecasts-new-backdrop-feature/|title = How to set up Chromecast's new Backdrop feature|work = [[CNET]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|first = Jason|last = Cipriani|date = October 8, 2014|accessdate = October 17, 2014}}\n</ref>\n\nIf a television's [[HDMI]] ports support the [[Consumer Electronics Control]] (CEC) feature, pressing the cast button will also result in the video-capable Chromecast automatically turning on the TV and switching the television's active audio/video input using the CEC command \"One Touch Playback\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/165639-hdmi-2-0-released-18gbps-of-bandwidth-allowing-for-4k-60-fps-32-audio-channels|title=HDMI 2.0 released: 18Gbps of bandwidth allowing for 4K @ 60 fps, 32 audio channels|work=[[ExtremeTech]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|first=Sebastian|last=Anthony|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Hardware and design==\nChromecast devices are [[dongle]]s that are powered by connecting the device's [[micro-USB]] port to an [[AC adapter|external power supply]] or a [[USB]] port.

The Google Cast [[Software development kit|SDK]] was released on February 3, 2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to work with Chromecast and other Cast receivers. According to Google, over 20,000 Google Cast\u2013ready apps are available, as of May 2015. Over 30&nbsp;million units have sold globally since launch, making the Chromecast the best-selling streaming device in the United States in 2014, according to [[NPD Group]]. From Chromecast's launch to May 2015, it handled more than 1.5 billion stream requests.\n\n==Development==\nAccording to Google, the Chromecast was originally conceived by engineer Majd Bakar. His inspiration for the product came around 2008 after noticing the film-viewing tendencies of his wife Carla Hindie. Using her laptop, she would search for a film to watch on a [[Streaming media|streaming]] service and add it to her queue, before closing her laptop and using a gaming device to play the film on a television. She took these steps because she found television interfaces difficult to use to search for content. Bakar found the whole process inefficient and wanted to build a phone-based interface that would allow video to play on a large display through a small hardware device.

Santo Domingo was subject to frequent raids by English and French [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]].

Black signifies areas that are [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] or parts of countries with a capital outside the Americas.]]\n\n[[Decolonization of the Americas]] began with the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]] in the late 1700s. This was followed by numerous [[Latin American wars of independence]] in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the [[Dominican War of Independence|Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti]], it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the [[Dominican Restoration War]]. The last violent episode of decolonization was the [[Cuban War of Independence]] which became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which resulted in the independence of [[Cuba]] in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over [[Puerto Rico]] from Spain to the United States.\n\nPeaceful decolonization began with the purchase by the [[United States]] of [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana from France]] in 1803, [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Florida from Spain]] in 1819, of [[Alaska purchase|Alaska from Russia]] in 1867, and the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies|Danish West Indies from Denmark]] in 1916. [[Canada]] became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and ending with the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] similarly achieved partial independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but was re-absorbed into the United Kingdom in 1934. It was subsequently [[Newfoundland Act|confederated with Canada]] in 1949.\n\nThe remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after [[World War II]]. [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] became independent in 1962, and [[Guyana]] and [[Barbados]] both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the [[Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] all became independent of the United Kingdom, and [[Suriname]] became independent of the Netherlands. [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further|Geography of North America|Geography of South America}}\n[[File:Earth-DSCOVR-20150706-IFV.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the Americas]]\n\n=== Extent ===\nThe Americas make up most of the land in Earth's [[western hemisphere]].<ref>\n*{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|year=2001|quote=The part of the Earth comprising North and South America and surrounding waters; longitudes 20\u00b0W and 160\u00b0E are often considered its boundaries|page=1294|contribution=Western Hemisphere|edition=3rd|place=Springfield, MA|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary|date=2011|publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-550-10237-9|edition=12|location=London|page=1780|editor1-last=O'Neal|editor1-first=Mary}}\n*{{cite book|url=http://www.worldbook.com|title=The World Book Dictionary|date=2003|publisher=World Book, Inc|isbn=0-7166-0299-7|location=Chicago|page=2377|quote=Western Hemisphere, the half of the world that includes North and South America.}}\n*{{cite book|title=The American Heritage College Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-83595-9|edition=Fourth|location=Boston|page=1557|quote=Western Hemisphere The half of the earth comprising North America, Central America, and South America}}\n*{{cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Third|location=New York|page=1963|quote=The Half of the earth that contains the Americas|editor1-last=Stevenson|editor1-first=Angus|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=Christine A.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary|date=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-544-16606-6|edition=Fifth|location=Boston|quote=Western Hemisphere that half of the earth which includes North & South America}}</ref> The northernmost point of the Americas is [[Kaffeklubben Island]], which is the most northerly point of land on Earth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burress |first=Charles |url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/06/17/BAG4J779M31.DTL&type=science|title = Romancing the north Berkeley explorer may have stepped on ancient Thule|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date = June 17, 2004}}</ref> The southernmost point is the islands of [[Southern Thule]], although they are sometimes considered part of [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm|title=South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Antarctica \u2013 Travel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219114729/http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The mainland of the Americas is the world's longest north-to-south landmass.

Small enclaves of [[French language|French]]-, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in [[French Guiana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] respectively. [[Haitian Creole]] is dominant in the nation of [[Haiti]], where French is also spoken. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]] are more prominent in Latin America than in [[Anglo-America]], with [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. [[Creole language]]s other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.\n\nThe dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in [[Canada]], where it is the predominant language in [[Quebec]] and an official language in [[New Brunswick]] along with English. It is also an important language in [[Louisiana]], and in parts of [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the [[Southwestern United States]], which formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], especially in [[Californio|California]] and [[New Mexico]], where [[New Mexican Spanish|a distinct variety of Spanish]] spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the [[United States]] because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.\n\nThe nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.\n\nMost of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as [[Papiamento]], which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], various [[African languages]], and, more recently English. The [[lingua franca]] [[Portu\u00f1ol]], a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2006|title=Too Close for Comfort?

This was followed by numerous [[Latin American wars of independence]] in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the [[Dominican War of Independence|Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti]], it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the [[Dominican Restoration War]]. The last violent episode of decolonization was the [[Cuban War of Independence]] which became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which resulted in the independence of [[Cuba]] in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over [[Puerto Rico]] from Spain to the United States.\n\nPeaceful decolonization began with the purchase by the [[United States]] of [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana from France]] in 1803, [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Florida from Spain]] in 1819, of [[Alaska purchase|Alaska from Russia]] in 1867, and the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies|Danish West Indies from Denmark]] in 1916. [[Canada]] became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and ending with the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] similarly achieved partial independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but was re-absorbed into the United Kingdom in 1934. It was subsequently [[Newfoundland Act|confederated with Canada]] in 1949.\n\nThe remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after [[World War II]]. [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] became independent in 1962, and [[Guyana]] and [[Barbados]] both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the [[Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] all became independent of the United Kingdom, and [[Suriname]] became independent of the Netherlands. [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further|Geography of North America|Geography of South America}}\n[[File:Earth-DSCOVR-20150706-IFV.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the Americas]]\n\n=== Extent ===\nThe Americas make up most of the land in Earth's [[western hemisphere]].<ref>\n*{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|year=2001|quote=The part of the Earth comprising North and South America and surrounding waters; longitudes 20\u00b0W and 160\u00b0E are often considered its boundaries|page=1294|contribution=Western Hemisphere|edition=3rd|place=Springfield, MA|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary|date=2011|publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-550-10237-9|edition=12|location=London|page=1780|editor1-last=O'Neal|editor1-first=Mary}}\n*{{cite book|url=http://www.worldbook.com|title=The World Book Dictionary|date=2003|publisher=World Book, Inc|isbn=0-7166-0299-7|location=Chicago|page=2377|quote=Western Hemisphere, the half of the world that includes North and South America.}}\n*{{cite book|title=The American Heritage College Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-83595-9|edition=Fourth|location=Boston|page=1557|quote=Western Hemisphere The half of the earth comprising North America, Central America, and South America}}\n*{{cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Third|location=New York|page=1963|quote=The Half of the earth that contains the Americas|editor1-last=Stevenson|editor1-first=Angus|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=Christine A.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary|date=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-544-16606-6|edition=Fifth|location=Boston|quote=Western Hemisphere that half of the earth which includes North & South America}}</ref> The northernmost point of the Americas is [[Kaffeklubben Island]], which is the most northerly point of land on Earth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burress |first=Charles |url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/06/17/BAG4J779M31.DTL&type=science|title = Romancing the north Berkeley explorer may have stepped on ancient Thule|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date = June 17, 2004}}</ref> The southernmost point is the islands of [[Southern Thule]], although they are sometimes considered part of [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm|title=South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Antarctica \u2013 Travel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219114729/http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The mainland of the Americas is the world's longest north-to-south landmass.

Small enclaves of [[French language|French]]-, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in [[French Guiana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] respectively. [[Haitian Creole]] is dominant in the nation of [[Haiti]], where French is also spoken. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]] are more prominent in Latin America than in [[Anglo-America]], with [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. [[Creole language]]s other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.\n\nThe dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in [[Canada]], where it is the predominant language in [[Quebec]] and an official language in [[New Brunswick]] along with English. It is also an important language in [[Louisiana]], and in parts of [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the [[Southwestern United States]], which formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], especially in [[Californio|California]] and [[New Mexico]], where [[New Mexican Spanish|a distinct variety of Spanish]] spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the [[United States]] because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.\n\nThe nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.\n\nMost of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as [[Papiamento]], which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], various [[African languages]], and, more recently English. The [[lingua franca]] [[Portu\u00f1ol]], a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2006|title=Too Close for Comfort?

In 1858, another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. \n\nAbout thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], along with his colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of late romance, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of Esztergom and [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]], the rabbi of [[Szeged]] {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. \n\nUntil World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since.

This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center. \n\nOver the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. \n\nAccordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF.

He was the creator, [[showrunner]] and host of the preschool television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', which ran from 1968 to 2001.\n\nBorn in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]], Rogers earned a bachelor's degree in music from [[Rollins College]] in 1951. He began his television career in 1951 at [[NBC]] in New York. He returned to Pittsburgh in 1953 to work for children's programming at NET (later [[PBS]]) television station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]]. After graduating from [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]], he became a [[Presbyterian minister]] in 1963 and attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Graduate School of Child Development, where he began his 30-year long collaboration with child psychologist [[Margaret McFarland]]. He also helped develop the children's shows ''The Children's Corner'' (1955) and ''Misterogers'' (1963). In 1968 he created ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'', which ran for 33 years. The program was critically acclaimed for focusing on children's emotional and physical concerns, such as death, [[sibling rivalry]], school enrollment, and [[divorce in the United States|divorce]].\n\nRogers died of [[stomach cancer]] on February 27, 2003, at the age of 74. His work in children's television has been widely lauded, and he received over 40 honorary degrees and several awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2002 and a [[Lifetime Achievement Emmy]] in 1997. He was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1999. Rogers influenced many writers and producers of children's television shows, and his broadcasts have served as a source of comfort during tragic events, even after his death.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Latrobe PA MainStreet.jpg|left|thumb|Main Street, [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], Rogers' birthplace]]\nRogers was born on March 20, 1928, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], about {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=|sp=us}} outside of [[Pittsburgh]], at 705 Main Street<ref name=\"Burlington Free Press 2018\">{{cite web |last=Harpaz |first=Beth J. |title=Mister Rogers: 'Won't you be my neighbor?' fans can check out Fred Rogers Trail |website=Burlington Free Press |date=July 18, 2018 |url=https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/entertainment/2018/07/18/mister-rogers-fans-documentary-show-can-visit-fred-rogers-trail/795861002/ |agency=Associated Press| access-date=November 1, 2018}}</ref> to James and Nancy Rogers.

He was the creator, [[showrunner]] and host of the preschool television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', which ran from 1968 to 2001.\n\nBorn in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]], Rogers earned a bachelor's degree in music from [[Rollins College]] in 1951. He began his television career in 1951 at [[NBC]] in New York. He returned to Pittsburgh in 1953 to work for children's programming at NET (later [[PBS]]) television station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]]. After graduating from [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]], he became a [[Presbyterian minister]] in 1963 and attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Graduate School of Child Development, where he began his 30-year long collaboration with child psychologist [[Margaret McFarland]]. He also helped develop the children's shows ''The Children's Corner'' (1955) and ''Misterogers'' (1963). In 1968 he created ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'', which ran for 33 years. The program was critically acclaimed for focusing on children's emotional and physical concerns, such as death, [[sibling rivalry]], school enrollment, and [[divorce in the United States|divorce]].\n\nRogers died of [[stomach cancer]] on February 27, 2003, at the age of 74. His work in children's television has been widely lauded, and he received over 40 honorary degrees and several awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2002 and a Lifetime Achievement [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] in 1997. He was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1999. Rogers influenced many writers and producers of children's television shows, and his broadcasts have served as a source of comfort during tragic events, even after his death.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Latrobe PA MainStreet.jpg|left|thumb|Main Street, [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], Rogers' birthplace]]\nRogers was born on March 20, 1928, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], about {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=|sp=us}} outside of [[Pittsburgh]], at 705 Main Street<ref name=\"Burlington Free Press 2018\">{{cite web |last=Harpaz |first=Beth J. |title=Mister Rogers: 'Won't you be my neighbor?' fans can check out Fred Rogers Trail |website=Burlington Free Press |date=July 18, 2018 |url=https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/entertainment/2018/07/18/mister-rogers-fans-documentary-show-can-visit-fred-rogers-trail/795861002/ |agency=Associated Press| access-date=November 1, 2018}}</ref> to James and Nancy Rogers.
