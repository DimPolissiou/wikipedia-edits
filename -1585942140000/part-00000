It comprises a {{convert|260.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} [[guyed mast]] with [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] attached at various heights. The average height above sea level is {{convert|392|m}} for the television antennas. It is owned and operated by [[Arqiva]]. The mast sways {{convert|10|ft|0}}, which is quite high for a mast this size.\n\n==History==\nThe original {{convert|750|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} mast at the site was built in 1952 by the BBC to provide [[405-line]] [[VHF]] television to south Wales and the west of England. The station broadcast on [[Band I]] channel 5 (66.75&nbsp;MHz) from 15 August 1952 using its reserve transmitters, and from 20 December 1952 with its main high-power transmitters.<ref>Pawley, Edward. 1972.  ''BBC Engineering 1922-1972'' p. 374. BBC Publications, {{ISBN|0-563-12127-0}}</ref> It remained on air until the closure of 405-line television in 1985.\n\nIn 1955 [[VHF]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio was added to the mast, carrying the BBC's [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]. This was followed by the addition of the [[Light Programme]] in 1956 and the [[Third Programme]] in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 a second {{convert|625|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} mast was built alongside the existing structure. This was in order to carry the new BBC Wales 405-line TV service on [[Band III]] VHF channel 13, and entered service on 9 February 1964.<ref>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1964-29.pdf</ref> The 405-line transmitter for this service was closed early, in 1983.\n\nOn 12 September 1965, a 625-line black and white television service [[BBC2]] became available from Wenvoe on [[UHF]]. This new transmitter was capable of colour broadcasting from the start and was used for unannounced colour TV engineering test-transmissions from that point onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbceng.info/videos.htm#Wenvoe%20Open%20Day%20-%201965 |title=Videos |publisher=Bbceng.info |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1967 BBC2 officially launched a colour TV service from Wenvoe, a few months after BBC2 Crystal Palace and others had launched the UK's first colour broadcasting in July of that year.\n\nIn 1970 [[UHF]] 625-line colour television was introduced for [[BBC One|BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Wales ([[ITV Wales & West|HTV Wales]]. [[S4C]] was added later when it launched in 1982.\n\nIn 1985, when 405-line TV closed, the site was re-engineered and both of the existing masts were taken down. They were replaced by a brand new mast (to be known as Wenvoe \"A\"), which is the structure currently in place at the site. Wenvoe \"B\" is a self-supporting telecommunications mast nearby. The VHF FM antennas were upgraded from the old horizontally polarised slot antennas to new mixed polarisation antennas, and the transmitter power was doubled.\n\nThe new analogue [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] was launched in 1997, but this was never transmitted from Wenvoe. It was presumably thought that the 125&nbsp;kW transmitter at [[Mendip transmitting station|Mendip]] would serve a satisfactory number of homes in Wenvoe's service area. At the time, many homes within range of Mendip already had aerials pointing at it so as to receive the English-only [[Channel 4]] rather than the bilingual English/Welsh [[S4C]] transmitted from Wenvoe.\n\n[[Image:Wenvoe Transmitter from Barry.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The mast seen in the distance from Barry]]\n\nWork began on a new temporary {{convert|217.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} stayed mast (Wenvoe \"C\") on 14 June 2006 and it was completed in September 2006. This carried the analogue signals whilst Wenvoe \"A\" was to be structurally improved and extended by {{convert|23|m|ft|0}}. Wenvoe \"A\" was fitted with a new high-power digital antenna and a full reserve antenna. New high-power digital TV transmitters were installed in the buildings, which would allow Wenvoe \"A\" to broadcast all six main digital TV multiplexes, as well as a seventh currently proposed by OFCOM <ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090204172151/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/notice524/summary/]</ref> after the analogue signals were switched off in 2010.\n\nThis mechanical upgrade was completed by the summer of 2009 and Wenvoe \"C\" was dismantled starting in late August 2009.\n\nWenvoe's analogue BBC Two service was switched off on 3 March 2010 and the remaining analogue TV services were switched off on 31 March 2010. At this point, Wales had officially completed its switchover to digital TV services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8593948.stm |title=Wales is first UK nation to switch fully to digital TV |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[BBC Radio Wales]] commenced broadcasting from the Wenvoe Transmitter on 6 December 2011 at 10:39.

The new Band I antenna was brought into service on 8 December 1964, and was sited immediately below the Band V antenna and above the Band II antenna.

The station broadcast on [[Band I]] channel 5 (66.75&nbsp;MHz) from 15 August 1952 using its reserve transmitters, and from 20 December 1952 with its main high-power transmitters.<ref>Pawley, Edward. 1972.  ''BBC Engineering 1922-1972'' p. 374. BBC Publications, {{ISBN|0-563-12127-0}}</ref> It remained on air until the closure of 405-line television in 1985.\n\nIn 1955 [[VHF]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio was added to the mast, carrying the BBC's [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]. This was followed by the addition of the [[Light Programme]] in 1956 and the [[Third Programme]] in 1959.\n\nIn 1963 a second {{convert|625|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} mast was built alongside the existing structure. This was in order to carry the new BBC Wales 405-line TV service on [[Band III]] VHF channel 13, and entered service on 9 February 1964.<ref>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1964-29.pdf</ref> The 405-line transmitter for this service was closed early, in 1983.\n\nOn 12 September 1965, a 625-line black and white television service [[BBC2]] became available from Wenvoe on [[UHF]]. This new transmitter was capable of colour broadcasting from the start and was used for unannounced colour TV engineering test-transmissions from that point onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbceng.info/videos.htm#Wenvoe%20Open%20Day%20-%201965 |title=Videos |publisher=Bbceng.info |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1967 BBC2 officially launched a colour TV service from Wenvoe, a few months after BBC2 Crystal Palace and others had launched the UK's first colour broadcasting in July of that year.\n\nIn 1970 [[UHF]] 625-line colour television was introduced for [[BBC One|BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Wales ([[ITV Wales & West|HTV Wales]]. [[S4C]] was added later when it launched in 1982.\n\nIn 1985, when 405-line TV closed, the site was re-engineered and both of the existing masts were taken down. They were replaced by a brand new mast (to be known as Wenvoe \"A\"), which is the structure currently in place at the site. Wenvoe \"B\" is a self-supporting telecommunications mast nearby. The VHF FM antennas were upgraded from the old horizontally polarised slot antennas to new mixed polarisation antennas, and the transmitter power was doubled.\n\nThe new analogue [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] was launched in 1997, but this was never transmitted from Wenvoe. It was presumably thought that the 125&nbsp;kW transmitter at [[Mendip transmitting station|Mendip]] would serve a satisfactory number of homes in Wenvoe's service area. At the time, many homes within range of Mendip already had aerials pointing at it so as to receive the English-only [[Channel 4]] rather than the bilingual English/Welsh [[S4C]] transmitted from Wenvoe.\n\n[[Image:Wenvoe Transmitter from Barry.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The mast seen in the distance from Barry]]\n\nWork began on a new temporary {{convert|217.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} stayed mast (Wenvoe \"C\") on 14 June 2006 and it was completed in September 2006. This carried the analogue signals whilst Wenvoe \"A\" was to be structurally improved and extended by {{convert|23|m|ft|0}}. Wenvoe \"A\" was fitted with a new high-power digital antenna and a full reserve antenna. New high-power digital TV transmitters were installed in the buildings, which would allow Wenvoe \"A\" to broadcast all six main digital TV multiplexes, as well as a seventh currently proposed by OFCOM <ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090204172151/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/notice524/summary/]</ref> after the analogue signals were switched off in 2010.\n\nThis mechanical upgrade was completed by the summer of 2009 and Wenvoe \"C\" was dismantled starting in late August 2009.\n\nWenvoe's analogue BBC Two service was switched off on 3 March 2010 and the remaining analogue TV services were switched off on 31 March 2010. At this point, Wales had officially completed its switchover to digital TV services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8593948.stm |title=Wales is first UK nation to switch fully to digital TV |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[BBC Radio Wales]] commenced broadcasting from the Wenvoe Transmitter on 6 December 2011 at 10:39.

The new Band I antenna was brought into service on 8 December 1964, and was sited immediately below the Band V antenna and above the Band II antenna. This put it in close proximity with the fixings of the top deck of guy wires, requiring some careful engineering so as not to affect the radiation pattern adversely.<ref>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1965-31.pdf</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!{{no2}}Frequency\n!{{no2}}VHF\n!{{no2}}UHF\n!{{no2}}kW\n!{{no2}}Service\n|-\n|{{UK System A|ch=5}}\n|5V\n|\u2014\n|100\n|[[BBC One|BBC1]]\n|-\n|{{UK System A|ch=13}}\n|13V\n|\u2014\n|200\n|[[BBC One Wales|BBC1 Wales]]\n|-\n|{{UK System I|ch=51}}\n|\u2014\n|51\n|500\n|[[BBC Two Wales|BBC2 Wales]]\u2020\n|}\n\n\u2020 Monochrome initially, colour TV service started September 1967.\n\n====April 1970 - 1 November 1982====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!{{no2}}Frequency\n!{{no2}}VHF\n!{{no2}}UHF\n!{{no2}}kW\n!{{no2}}Service\n|-\n|{{UK System A|ch=5}}\n|5V\n|\u2014\n|100\n|[[BBC One|BBC1]]\n|-\n|{{UK System A|ch=13}}\n|13V\n|\u2014\n|200\n|[[BBC One Wales|BBC1 Wales]]\n|-\n|{{UK System I|ch=41}}\n|\u2014\n|41\n|500\n|[[ITV Wales & West|HTV Wales]]\n|-\n|{{UK System I|ch=44}}\n|\u2014\n|44\n|500\n|BBC1 Wales\u2020\n|-\n|{{UK System I|ch=51}}\n|\u2014\n|51\n|500\n|[[BBC Two Wales|BBC2 Wales]]\n|}\n\n\u2020 Monochrome initially, colour production at BBC One Wales started 9 July 1970.\n\n====1 November 1982 - 1st Quarter 1983====\nChannel Four launched across the UK.
