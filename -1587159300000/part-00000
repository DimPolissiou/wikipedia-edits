Following notable successes in [[sports car racing]] during the mid- to late-1950s \u2014 culminating in winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance race and the [[World Sportscar Championship]] title in {{24hLM|1959}} \u2014 the DBR4 was intended to repeat this success in the highest tier of [[Formula racing|open-wheel racing]].\n\nThe DBR4 was largely based on the [[Aston Martin DB3S|DB3S]] sportscar, and borrowed that vehicle's basic chassis and engine layout. Although it was tested as early as 1957, the DBR4 did not make its World Championship debut until the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]], driven by [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. However, its long gestation period meant that by the time it finally entered competition much of its concept and technology had been superseded, and the car was not a success. The DBR4 was replaced by the lighter [[Aston Martin DBR5]]/250 in early 1960, but when that car also failed to provide competitive results Aston Martin abandoned Formula One to concentrate on their more successful sports car projects.\n\n==Design==\nA potential open-wheeled Aston Martin racing car had been discussed as early as 1955, and a hastily constructed prototype was tested in the Australian and New Zealand races in early 1956, driven by [[Reg Parnell]]. Following successes in this Antipodean experiment, and despite the majority of Aston's racing department being fully occupied with the sports car program, Aston Martin decided to pursue a Formula One entry in earnest. However, the company's emphasis on sports car competitions meant that attention was often diverted from the Formula One program, and development delays were common almost from the outset.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 cockpit Donington.jpg|thumb|left|The cockpit of an Aston Martin DBR4, showing the generous proportions of the chassis and details of its spaceframe construction.]]\nBuilding on Aston Martin's established road car and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional [[spaceframe]] structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. Beneath the skin the DBR4's basic design was closely related to the [[Aston Martin DB3S|DB3S]] sports car of 1956, but with its ancillary components more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use [[wind-tunnel]] testing for racing cars, such as the [[Bristol 450]], [[aerodynamics]] as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake on the side of the bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.\n\nSuspension was handled by [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]] with [[coil spring]]s and telescopic [[Shock absorber|dampers]] at the front, and a [[de Dion tube]] system with [[torsion bar]] springs at the rear. While this arrangement had been state-of-the-art in the early years of the 1950s, by the time that the DBR4 made its first public appearance most racing car manufacturers were moving to all-round [[independent suspension]], offering better handling, traction and road-holding than the older system employed at the rear of the Aston.  The DBR4 was the last new Grand Prix car to use the de Dion system. This same suspension system would be adapted to the [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]] sports car which was being developed at the same time as the DBR4, but would be abandoned less than a year later when the DBR3 was considered a failure.  To bring the car to a halt, [[Lucas Industries#Girling|Girling]] [[disc brake]]s were fitted all round.\n\nThe DBR4 also shared the basic [[Overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] [[straight-6]] Aston Martin engine design with its brethren, but sleeved to reduce its capacity to 2.5-litres. Although [[Tadek Marek]]'s design was a reliable and powerful unit in its 3.7-litre road car form, the reduced capacity racing motor was hard-pressed to cope with the heavy chassis and poor aerodynamics, and frequent engine failures blighted the DBR4's brief racing career. Aston Martin claimed a {{convert|280|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} output for the DBR4's engine. However, it was common practice at the time to overquote engine power, and a more realistic value is closer to {{convert|250|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. This value is still higher than that provided by the [[Coventry Climax]] ''FPF'' [[straight-4]], used by contemporary manufacturers such as [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], but the Aston Martin engine weighed appreciably more. The engine drove the rear wheels through a proprietary [[David Brown Ltd.|David Brown]] gearbox, provided by Aston Martin's owners.\n\nA total of four Aston Martin DBR4/250s were built between 1957 and 1959, with three surviving to date. Recognising their failings, the Aston Martin race team reworked the DBR4 into the DBR5 for the {{F1|1960}} season. The DBR5 was smaller and lighter, and engine modifications meant that the power output was finally close to the figure originally claimed by the Aston Martin workshop. The DBR5 also boasted all-independent suspension, but results did not improve from those of the DBR4 and both DBR5s were eventually broken up.\n\n==Competition career==\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington pits.jpg|thumb|right|The Aston Martin DBR4 had a sleek bodywork shape, broken by large air intakes and upright windscreen.]]\nThe Aston Martin DBR4/250 was unveiled to the public in April 1959, and made its competition debut on 2 May in the non-Championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Two cars were entered, for works drivers [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. Salvadori immediately began to show some promise in the car, posting third fastest time in qualifying, beaten only by fellow Britons [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]], driving a [[British Racing Partnership|BRP]] [[BRM P25]] and works [[Ferrari 246 Dino]] respectively. Shelby also posted some fast lap times, taking sixth place. In the race both Brooks and Moss retired with mechanical problems, but the Astons performed faultlessly for the majority of the distance, before Shelby's oil pump failed two laps from the finish. He placed sixth, two laps down. However, Salvadori was well-placed and competing hard for the lead. He posted the fastest lap of the race, en route to finishing second behind [[Jack Brabham]]'s works Cooper-Climax. Unfortunately for Aston Martin, the DBR4's debut performance flattered to deceive.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington paddock.jpg|thumb|left|A DBR4 is push-started in the paddock at Donington Park, 2007.]]\nAt the DBR4's World Championship debut in the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]] on 31 May, Shelby and Salvadori could only manage 10th and 13th fastest in qualification, respectively. During the race both cars succumbed to engine problems in the early laps and failed to finish. Further delays and shifted priorities meant that the light green Astons only appeared at a further three races of the [[1959 Formula One season]]. The DBR4s failed to score even a single point during this time; their best results being a pair of 6th places for Salvadori, taken at the [[1959 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1959 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese]] rounds. Following a second disappointing outing in the BRDC International Trophy (Trintignant was tenth and Salvadori's engine expired on lap 4), a solitary DBR4 appeared in practice for the [[1960 Dutch Grand Prix]], entered for Salvadori when the DBR5 was not ready. The car was saved further possible embarrassment when a starting money dispute caused Aston Martin to withdraw prior to the start.\n\nThe coda to the DBR4's racing career came in mid-1960, when a car was shipped to Australia for local racers [[Lex Davison]] and [[Bib Stillwell]] to compete in the Australian and New Zealand national championship [[Formula Libre]] races. Fitted with a 3.0-litre engine the car performed much better than had been the case during its brief Formula One life, and Davison took second place in the [[1960 Australian Grand Prix]]. To reflect the increase in engine capacity this car was officially known as the ''DBR4/300''. Stillwell retained the DBR4/300 until the end of the 1962\u201363 season.\n\n==Complete Formula One World Championship results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n!

Following notable successes in [[sports car racing]] during the mid- to late-1950s \u2014 culminating in winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance race and the [[World Sportscar Championship]] title in {{24hLM|1959}} \u2014 the DBR4 was intended to repeat this success in the highest tier of [[Formula racing|open-wheel racing]].\n\nThe DBR4 was largely based on the [[Aston Martin DB3S|DB3S]] sportscar, and borrowed that vehicle's basic chassis and engine layout. Although it was tested as early as 1957, the DBR4 did not make its World Championship debut until the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]], driven by [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. However, its long gestation period meant that by the time it finally entered competition much of its concept and technology had been superseded, and the car was not a success. The DBR4 was replaced by the lighter [[Aston Martin DBR5]]/250 in early 1960, but when that car also failed to provide competitive results Aston Martin abandoned Formula One to concentrate on their more successful sports car projects.\n\n==Design==\nA potential open-wheeled Aston Martin racing car had been discussed as early as 1955, and a hastily constructed prototype was tested in the Australian and New Zealand races in early 1956, driven by [[Reg Parnell]].

During the race both cars succumbed to engine problems in the early laps and failed to finish. Further delays and shifted priorities meant that the light green Astons only appeared at a further three races of the [[1959 Formula One season]].

Insofar as it fits into any standard classification, it is a [[serif]] font designed in the style of [[Times New Roman]].\n\nDue to its non-standard character set, lack of diacritical characters, and type design inappropriate for continuous text, Symbol cannot easily be used for setting [[Greek language]] text, though it has been used for that purpose in the absence of proper Greek fonts. Its primary purpose is to typeset [[mathematics|mathematical]] expressions.\n\n==Encoding==\n{{Infobox character encoding\n|name = Symbol Encoding\n|alias = x-mac-symbol, ibm-1038\n|image = Symbol-infobox-paths.svg\n|definitions = [https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/symbol.txt Adobe Symbol]<br />[https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT Mac OS Symbol]\n|caption = Code page layout (in [[DejaVu fonts]]).

The document describing the mapping to Unicode code points<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/symbol.txt |title=Adobe Symbol Encoding to Unicode |author= |date={{date|1999-03-30}} |work= |publisher=[[Unicode.org]] |accessdate=}}</ref> was created before several of the characters were added to Unicode, so the original mapping assigns several of the characters to the [[Private Use Area]] (PUA).  A later version of the font by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT |title=Map from Mac OS Symbol character set to Unicode 4.0 and later |author= |date={{date|2005-04-05}} |work= |publisher=Unicode.org |accessdate= }}</ref> uses more recently introduced Unicode code points instead.  The table below mostly follows the Apple mapping.\n\nIBM calls the encoding '''Code page 1038'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01038z.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708120330id_/http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01038z.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-08|title=Code Page 01038|website=IBM}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the use of Private Use Area code points, Adobe and Apple have a few other minor differences in code point assignments.  Character 0x27 (called \"suchthat\" in the Adobe document) is assigned by Adobe to U+220B (\u220b, CONTAINS AS MEMBER) but by Apple to U+220D (\u220d, SMALL CONTAINS AS MEMBER), which more closely resembles the symbol usually used for ''such that''.  Characters 0xE1 and 0xF1 are assigned to different sets of angle brackets: by Adobe to U+2329 and U+232A (\u3008 and \u3009), by Apple to U+3008 and U+3009 (\u3008 and \u3009).  Apple also introduces the Apple logo as PUA code point [[U+F8FF]] for character 0xF0, a position not used in the original Adobe font.\n\nLowercase Greek letters appear in [[italic type|italics]] in many older versions of Symbol.  While both Adobe and Apple agree on assigning characters 0x66 and 0x6A respectively to Unicode code points U+03C6 (\u03c6, GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI) and U+03D5 (\u03d5, GREEK PHI SYMBOL), some versions of the font interchange these two symbols.\n\n<!--NOTE: The table should use the apple mapping at http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT, as it makes less use of the PUA

Such explicit references are now strongly discouraged for new documents, but they survive in many existing pages on the [[Internet]]. Also, the Symbol font provides graphics that are specifically intended as components in the two-dimensional layout of mathematical expressions. Examples include upper and lower parts of brackets or integral signs and a square-root sign ''without'' a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]].\n\nUntil 2010 or so, the [[Unicode]] glyph U+221A corresponding to the square-root sign (the HTML [[List of XML and HTML character entity references|entity]] is named ''radic'' and has decimal code 8730) was usually rendered with a short built-in vinculum. That made it an inadequate graphical replacement for the original character from the Symbol font (itself designed around a slanted line extending all the way to the upper-right corner of the character box, without any spacing). The more recent renditions of the HTML ''radic'' entity (U+221A) no longer feature any vinculum and are thus more compatible with the standard graphical representation introduced in the Symbol font. Both styles of the square-root [[glyph]] (with or without a short vinculum) have the same disembodied ''meaning'', so the integrity of the [[Unicode]] repertoire is not compromised by this adjustment.\n\nFull [[Legacy system|legacy]] support of the Symbol font is provided by major modern [[web browsers]] like [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Google Chrome]]. That support involves a specific handling of Adobe's special encoding, which is not properly implemented in at least some versions of other browsers, including [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Firefox]]. Such browsers do not correctly render [[Legacy system|legacy]] HTML documents that make explicit use of the Symbol font.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aldo Novarese]]\n*[[DEC Technical Character Set]]\n*[[Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set]] (LMBCS)\n*[[MathTime]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |title=VENTURA_SYM |website=Eesti Keele Instituut (EKI) |location=Tallinn, Estonia |author=kiisu |url=http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?cp=VENTURA_SYM&1st=with+first+half&table=on |access-date=2017-07-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717184243/http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?cp=VENTURA_SYM&1st=with+first+half&table=on |archive-date=2017-07-17}}\n\n{{Microsoft Windows Typefaces}}\n{{MacOS typefaces}}\n[[Category:Symbol typefaces]]\n[[Category:Typefaces and fonts introduced in 1985]]\n", "text_old": "'''Symbol''' is one of the four standard fonts available on all [[PostScript]]-based printers, starting with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s original [[LaserWriter]] (1985). It contains a complete unaccented [[Greek alphabet]] (upper and lower case) and a selection of commonly used mathematical symbols. Insofar as it fits into any standard classification, it is a [[serif]] font designed in the style of [[Times New Roman]].\n\nDue to its non-standard character set, lack of diacritical characters, and type design inappropriate for continuous text, Symbol cannot easily be used for setting [[Greek language]] text, though it has been used for that purpose in the absence of proper Greek fonts. Its primary purpose is to typeset [[mathematics|mathematical]] expressions.\n\n==Encoding==\n{{Infobox character encoding\n|name = Symbol Encoding\n|alias = x-mac-symbol, ibm-1038\n|image = Symbol-infobox-paths.svg\n|definitions = [https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/symbol.txt Adobe Symbol]<br />[https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT Mac OS Symbol]\n|caption = Code page layout (in [[DejaVu fonts]]).

The document describing the mapping to Unicode code points<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/symbol.txt |title=Adobe Symbol Encoding to Unicode |author= |date={{date|1999-03-30}} |work= |publisher=[[Unicode.org]] |accessdate=}}</ref> was created before several of the characters were added to Unicode, so the original mapping assigns several of the characters to the [[Private Use Area]] (PUA).  A later version of the font by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT |title=Map from Mac OS Symbol character set to Unicode 4.0 and later |author= |date={{date|2005-04-05}} |work= |publisher=Unicode.org |accessdate= }}</ref> uses more recently introduced Unicode code points instead.  The table below mostly follows the Apple mapping.\n\nIBM calls the encoding '''Code page 1038'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01038z.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708120330id_/http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01038z.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-08|title=Code Page 01038|website=IBM}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the use of Private Use Area code points, Adobe and Apple have a few other minor differences in code point assignments.  Character 0x27 (called \"suchthat\" in the Adobe document) is assigned by Adobe to U+220B (\u220b, CONTAINS AS MEMBER) but by Apple to U+220D (\u220d, SMALL CONTAINS AS MEMBER), which more closely resembles the symbol usually used for ''such that''.  Characters 0xE1 and 0xF1 are assigned to different sets of angle brackets: by Adobe to U+2329 and U+232A (\u3008 and \u3009), by Apple to U+3008 and U+3009 (\u3008 and \u3009).  Apple also introduces the Apple logo as PUA code point [[U+F8FF]] for character 0xF0, a position not used in the original Adobe font.\n\nLowercase Greek letters appear in [[italic type|italics]] in many older versions of Symbol.  While both Adobe and Apple agree on assigning characters 0x66 and 0x6A respectively to Unicode code points U+03C6 (\u03c6, GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI) and U+03D5 (\u03d5, GREEK PHI SYMBOL), some versions of the font interchange these two symbols.\n\n<!--NOTE: The table should use the apple mapping at http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/SYMBOL.TXT, as it makes less use of the PUA

Such explicit references are now strongly discouraged for new documents, but they survive in many existing pages on the [[Internet]]. Also, the Symbol font provides graphics that are specifically intended as components in the two-dimensional layout of mathematical expressions. Examples include upper and lower parts of brackets or integral signs and a square-root sign ''without'' a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]].\n\nUntil 2010 or so, the [[Unicode]] glyph U+221A corresponding to the square-root sign (the HTML [[List of XML and HTML character entity references|entity]] is named ''radic'' and has decimal code 8730) was usually rendered with a short built-in vinculum. That made it an inadequate graphical replacement for the original character from the Symbol font (itself designed around a slanted line extending all the way to the upper-right corner of the character box, without any spacing). The more recent renditions of the HTML ''radic'' entity (U+221A) no longer feature any vinculum and are thus more compatible with the standard graphical representation introduced in the Symbol font. Both styles of the square-root [[glyph]] (with or without a short vinculum) have the same disembodied ''meaning'', so the integrity of the [[Unicode]] repertoire is not compromised by this adjustment.\n\nFull [[Legacy system|legacy]] support of the Symbol font is provided by major modern [[web browsers]] like [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Google Chrome]]. That support involves a specific handling of Adobe's special encoding, which is not properly implemented in at least some versions of other browsers, including [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Firefox]]. Such browsers do not correctly render [[Legacy system|legacy]] HTML documents that make explicit use of the Symbol font.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aldo Novarese]]\n*[[DEC Technical Character Set]]\n*[[Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set]] (LMBCS)\n*[[MathTime]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |title=VENTURA_SYM |website=Eesti Keele Instituut (EKI) |location=Tallinn, Estonia |author=kiisu |url=http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?cp=VENTURA_SYM&1st=with+first+half&table=on |access-date=2017-07-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717184243/http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?cp=VENTURA_SYM&1st=with+first+half&table=on |archive-date=2017-07-17}}\n\n{{Microsoft Windows Typefaces}}\n{{MacOS typefaces}}\n[[Category:Symbol typefaces]]\n[[Category:Typefaces and fonts introduced in 1985]]\n", "name_user": "Drmccreedy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix various code point/character mismatches.

This, too, is the highest region (IV.12.26); beyond the world of darkness and sams\u0101ra (the cycle of birth and death) (IV.24.29; X.88.25); the destination of those who have transcended the three Gunas even while they are still alive (XI.25.22); and beyond which there is no higher place (II.2.18, II.9.9). The peaceful ascetics who reach that place never return (IV.9.29; X.88.25-6). The residents of Vaikuntha do not have material bodies, but have pure forms (VII.1.34). These forms are like that of Vishnu (III.15.14ff.), also known as Narayana. Vishnu/Narayana resides in Vaikuntha with Sri, the goddess of fortune, in palaces with crystal walls. The parks there shine like final liberation itself, and contain wish-fulfilling trees, which blossom all the year round. There are fragrant winds, and creepers dripping with honey near bodies of water. Cries of exotic birds mingle with the humming of bees, and magnificent flowers bloom everywhere. Devotees of Vishnu along with their beautiful wives travel in aerial vehicles made of jewels, emeralds and gold, but the beautiful smiling residents of this realm cannot distract the minds of the opposite sex, since everyone is absorbed in Krishna (III.15.14-25).<ref>Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8Bb0tRW7W4C&pg=PT38&dq=krishna+vaikuntha&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUzoma-JjUAhUKM48KHUsCChY4FBDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&q=krishna%20vaikuntha&f=false</ref>}}\n\n\n{{quote|The Lord, being thus very much satisfied with the penance of Lord Brahma, was pleased to manifest His personal abode, Vaikuntha, the supreme planet above all others.

It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

R.

On his way there, during a rainy night, Amar stops at [[Haflong]] train station to catch the [[Barak Valley Express]]. As he waits, he tries to have a smoke and asks a mysterious person for either a match or a lighter. Suddenly a strong gust of wind blows the shawl off the person, revealing it to be a woman ([[Manisha Koirala]]). Amar finds her very attractive and tries to strike up a conversation, but she ignores him for a bit and then asks him for a cup of tea. When he returns with the tea, he watches as she boards the next train with three male passengers and rides off into the distance.\n\nLater, Amar spots the same woman in [[Silchar]]. He attempts to talk to her, but she says she cannot recall meeting him before. As part of his news reporting assignment, for the occasion of fifty years of Indian [[Independence]], Amar interviews many citizens of Assam, and an extremist chief (Gautam Bora), who claims that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian Government, and that the [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s do not wish to enter into any dialogue with the government, and further justify their resistance in [[Northeast India|Utthar Purv]].\n\nA few weeks later, Amar describes his encounter with the woman, over the radio, which she hears. He again spots her at a [[post office]]. At this juncture, she tells him to leave her alone; but he follows her to the house and tells her that he is in love with her. She resists and tells Amar that she is married. Amar wishes to apologize to her, but she arrives with two men who beat him unconscious.\n\nDuring the beating, Amar learns that the men are presumably her brothers and that she had lied about her being married. He reaches her home, and learns from the locals that she has left the place. Amar then goes to the post office where he initially spotted her and bribes the PCO owner into giving him her contact details, and learns that she is telephoning to [[Ladakh]]. Subsequently, Amar travels to [[Leh]], and while recording the [[Sindhu Darshan Festival]], a suicide bomber is chased to death by the military, and Amar spots the woman again. As the woman and Amar board a bus, military officers question each passenger before the bus is allowed to leave. While Amar tell the officers that he is there reporting on the festival, the woman uses Amar to her advantage and tells the officers that Amar is her husband.\n\nAfter some travel, the bus breaks down and the passengers are required to walk to a nearby village. En route Amar forces the woman to reveal her name: Meghna. The two end up traveling together and recuperate. In the morning, Amar wakes to find Meghna gone. It is later revealed that Meghna is part of a [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s group which has planned multiple [[suicide attack]]s in New Delhi at the upcoming [[Republic Day]] celebrations.\n\nAmar returns to his home in Delhi, where his family has found Preeti Nair ([[Preity Zinta]]) from [[Kerala]] as a potential bride for him. Amar agrees to marry Preeti because he has no hope that he will ever meet Meghna again. On his date with Preeti, Amar spots one of Meghna's associates, Kim, who banished him earlier. Amar chases him down to [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], where the man kills himself with a cyanide pill after being stopped by local police. Because of the extremist nature of the situation, the police relinquish the incident to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]].\n\nMuch to Amar's surprise, Meghna shows up in Delhi and asks Amar to help her get a job as an office assistant at Amar's All India Radio office. It is later revealed that Meghna actually arrives in Delhi with her terrorist group and stays in Amar's residence to escape from the CBI inquiry operation. Based on eyewitness claims of the Connaught Place incident, Amar is now a prime suspect of the CBI ([[Piyush Mishra]]). At this juncture Amar follows Meghna and questions her motives, and she reveals to Amar that her name is actually Moina, and as a child, she had been [[Kunan Poshpora incident|a rape victim of the army]] and seeks liberation through her [[suicide attack]] on the Indian army and the President of India during [[Republic Day]]. Now the CBI convinces the [[Army general]] of India to grant permission to conduct security checks of all the Army [[convoy]]s and tankers participating in the parade.\n\nAmar is again assaulted by Moina's associate ([[Aditya Srivastava]]) and the terrorists and as Amar fights back the terrorists receive a call from Moina on their mobile. Amar grabs the mobile and pleads with Moina to stop all this and marry him. Moina reveals that it is too late, and presumes Amar is being killed. But Amar returns home, only to find out from Preeti that Amar's mother is also being questioned and that Moina's location is at Sunder Nagar. The CBI also misconstrue that Amar is part of the terrorist group and arrest him.\n\nAmar claims to the CBI that he is not in cahoots with the terrorists, but in love with Moina and that he has interviewed one of the extremist leaders and wants to prevent them from perpetrating the attack. The CBI rejects Amar's claims and sedates him for further interrogation. The next day Moina is ready for the suicide attack. Amar escapes from the CBI and tries to hold Moina back. Amar expresses his love and desire to be with her. When she is still indecisive, he tells her he will even die with her if she does not wish to stop her suicide attempt. He embraces her and continues to plead with her to live with him. As they embrace, the explosive vest worn by Moina explodes, killing them both.As the credits roll,it is shown that CBI manages to nab each and every member of the terrorist group just at the nick of time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as Amarkant Varma\n* [[Manisha Koirala]] as Moina/Meghna\n* [[Preity Zinta]] as Preeti Nair\n* [[Mita Vasisht]] as Mita\n* [[Arundathi Nag|Arundhati Rao]] as Kanval Dev Burman \u2013 AIR station director\n* [[Raghuvir Yadav]] as Shukla ji \u2013 AIR manager\n* [[Zohra Sehgal]] as Amar's Grandmother\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Gautam Bora]] as terrorist Leader\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] as terrorist\n* [[Aditya Srivastava]] as Terrorist\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as terrorist\n* [[Anupam Shyam]] as terrorist\n* [[Shabbir Masani]] as terrorist\n* Krisn Kant as Kim terrorist\n* [[Manjit Bawa]] as terrorist\n* [[Vineeta Malik]] as Amar's mother\n* [[Piyush Mishra]] as CBI investigation officer\n* [[Gajraj Rao (actor)|Gajraj Rao]] as CBI investigation officer\n* Priya Parulekar as Young Moina\n* [[Malaika Arora]] in the [[item number]] \"[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]\"\n* Vanitha Malik as school teacher\n* [[Tigmanshu Dhulia]] as  cameo appearance as man at the post office\n* [[Sameer Chanda]] as cameo appearance [[Tuba]] music shop dealer\n* [[Shaad Ali]] as cameo as citizen of Silchar\n* [[Wasiq Khan]] as cameo\n* Pia Benegal as cameo\n* Chintu Mohapatra as cameo\n* [[Karan Nath]] as cameo\n* [[Hemant Mishra]] as cameo\n* [[B.

On his way there, during a rainy night, Amar stops at [[Haflong]] train station to catch the [[Barak Valley Express]]. As he waits, he tries to have a smoke and asks a mysterious person for either a match or a lighter. Suddenly a strong gust of wind blows the shawl off the person, revealing it to be a woman ([[Manisha Koirala]]). Amar finds her very attractive and tries to strike up a conversation, but she ignores him for a bit and then asks him for a cup of tea. When he returns with the tea, he watches as she boards the next train with three male passengers and rides off into the distance.\n\nLater, Amar spots the same woman in [[Silchar]]. He attempts to talk to her, but she says she cannot recall meeting him before. As part of his news reporting assignment, for the occasion of fifty years of Indian [[Independence]], Amar interviews many citizens of Assam, and an extremist chief (Gautam Bora), who claims that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian Government, and that the [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s do not wish to enter into any dialogue with the government, and further justify their resistance in [[Northeast India|Utthar Purv]].\n\nA few weeks later, Amar describes his encounter with the woman, over the radio, which she hears. He again spots her at a [[post office]]. At this juncture, she tells him to leave her alone; but he follows her to the house and tells her that he is in love with her. She resists and tells Amar that she is married. Amar wishes to apologize to her, but she arrives with two men who beat him unconscious.\n\nDuring the beating, Amar learns that the men are presumably her brothers and that she had lied about her being married. He reaches her home, and learns from the locals that she has left the place. Amar then goes to the post office where he initially spotted her and bribes the PCO owner into giving him her contact details, and learns that she is telephoning to [[Ladakh]]. Subsequently, Amar travels to [[Leh]], and while recording the [[Sindhu Darshan Festival]], a suicide bomber is chased to death by the military, and Amar spots the woman again. As the woman and Amar board a bus, military officers question each passenger before the bus is allowed to leave. While Amar tell the officers that he is there reporting on the festival, the woman uses Amar to her advantage and tells the officers that Amar is her husband.\n\nAfter some travel, the bus breaks down and the passengers are required to walk to a nearby village. En route Amar forces the woman to reveal her name: Meghna. The two end up traveling together and recuperate. In the morning, Amar wakes to find Meghna gone. It is later revealed that Meghna is part of a [[United Liberation Front of Assam|Liberationist]]s group which has planned multiple [[suicide attack]]s in New Delhi at the upcoming [[Republic Day]] celebrations.\n\nAmar returns to his home in Delhi, where his family has found Preeti Nair ([[Preity Zinta]]) from [[Kerala]] as a potential bride for him. Amar agrees to marry Preeti because he has no hope that he will ever meet Meghna again. On his date with Preeti, Amar spots one of Meghna's associates, Kim, who banished him earlier. Amar chases him down to [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], where the man kills himself with a cyanide pill after being stopped by local police. Because of the extremist nature of the situation, the police relinquish the incident to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]].\n\nMuch to Amar's surprise, Meghna shows up in Delhi and asks Amar to help her get a job as an office assistant at Amar's All India Radio office. It is later revealed that Meghna actually arrives in Delhi with her terrorist group and stays in Amar's residence to escape from the CBI inquiry operation. Based on eyewitness claims of the Connaught Place incident, Amar is now a prime suspect of the CBI ([[Piyush Mishra]]). At this juncture Amar follows Meghna and questions her motives, and she reveals to Amar that her name is actually Moina, and as a child, she had been [[Kunan Poshpora incident|a rape victim of the army]] and seeks liberation through her [[suicide attack]] on the Indian army and the President of India during [[Republic Day]]. Now the CBI convinces the [[Army general]] of India to grant permission to conduct security checks of all the Army [[convoy]]s and tankers participating in the parade.\n\nAmar is again assaulted by Moina's associate ([[Aditya Srivastava]]) and the terrorists and as Amar fights back the terrorists receive a call from Moina on their mobile. Amar grabs the mobile and pleads with Moina to stop all this and marry him. Moina reveals that it is too late, and presumes Amar is being killed. But Amar returns home, only to find out from Preeti that Amar's mother is also being questioned and that Moina's location is at Sunder Nagar. The CBI also misconstrue that Amar is part of the terrorist group and arrest him.\n\nAmar claims to the CBI that he is not in cahoots with the terrorists, but in love with Moina and that he has interviewed one of the extremist leaders and wants to prevent them from perpetrating the attack. The CBI rejects Amar's claims and sedates him for further interrogation. The next day Moina is ready for the suicide attack. Amar escapes from the CBI and tries to hold Moina back. Amar expresses his love and desire to be with her. When she is still indecisive, he tells her he will even die with her if she does not wish to stop her suicide attempt. He embraces her and continues to plead with her to live with him. As they embrace, the explosive vest worn by Moina explodes, killing them both.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as Amarkant Varma\n* [[Manisha Koirala]] as Moina/Meghna\n* [[Preity Zinta]] as Preeti Nair\n* [[Mita Vasisht]] as Mita\n* [[Arundathi Nag|Arundhati Rao]] as Kanval Dev Burman \u2013 AIR station director\n* [[Raghuvir Yadav]] as Shukla ji \u2013 AIR manager\n* [[Zohra Sehgal]] as Amar's Grandmother\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Gautam Bora]] as terrorist Leader\n* [[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]] as terrorist\n* [[Aditya Srivastava]] as Terrorist\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as terrorist\n* [[Anupam Shyam]] as terrorist\n* [[Shabbir Masani]] as terrorist\n* Krisn Kant as Kim terrorist\n* [[Manjit Bawa]] as terrorist\n* [[Vineeta Malik]] as Amar's mother\n* [[Piyush Mishra]] as CBI investigation officer\n* [[Gajraj Rao (actor)|Gajraj Rao]] as CBI investigation officer\n* Priya Parulekar as Young Moina\n* [[Malaika Arora]] in the [[item number]] \"[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]\"\n* Vanitha Malik as school teacher\n* [[Tigmanshu Dhulia]] as  cameo appearance as man at the post office\n* [[Sameer Chanda]] as cameo appearance [[Tuba]] music shop dealer\n* [[Shaad Ali]] as cameo as citizen of Silchar\n* [[Wasiq Khan]] as cameo\n* Pia Benegal as cameo\n* Chintu Mohapatra as cameo\n* [[Karan Nath]] as cameo\n* [[Hemant Mishra]] as cameo\n* [[B.
