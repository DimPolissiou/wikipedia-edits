Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]].

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|Second World War]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

Complications arise for the ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' production team, after having wooed and won Carol Vorderman as [[Clare Balding]]'s replacement to co-present with [[Alan Titchmarsh]]. However, at the last minute Clare Balding is available and turns up at [[Broadcasting House|New Broadcasting House]] as Carol Vorderman is leaving and they have to be kept apart.

The debate about the future of the BBC is not helped when Ian Fletcher's salary comes under intense scrutiny in the press. Neil Reid, current Controller of Current Affairs, is having to deal with the fallout from a blunder in [[BBC News]] coverage of the Syrian crisis when a photo of [[Trudie Styler]] was used instead of [[Asma al-Assad]]. Producer Lucy Freeman goes in to pitch ''Home Truth'', a script she's been developing over several years with writer Dan Shepherd.

Meanwhile, a female ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter has been accused of wearing clothes that are inappropriately watchable. When the name of the programme becomes known as Kneesnight and her legs get their own Twitter account there is a feeling something should be done about it. Flagship series ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' has lost all three of the big-name presenters who were attached to do the show \u2013 so the search continues.

One of her first jobs is to head up discussion on the Way Ahead Task Force around inclusivity targets, with an imminent meeting of the Cross Parliamentary Inclusion Action Watch Dog Group at Westminster.\nSiobhan Sharpe's idea is to \"viralise\" Muslim BBC Weather presenter Sadiq Iqbal, who is less than thrilled with the idea of becoming a national icon.\nIt's down to Head of Values Ian Fletcher to try and steer the BBC ship through increasingly choppy waters, while at the same time decide who he'd like to spend his free evening with, Lucy or Anna.\n |LineColor=fbec5d\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3===\nIn August 2016, the BBC announced that ''W1A'' would return for a third and final series, due to be produced and broadcast in 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-08-22/next-series-of-w1a-set-for-2017 |title=Next series of W1A set for 2017 |last1=Dowell |first1=Ben |date=22 August 2016 |magazine=Radio Times|access-date=12 October 2016 }}</ref> Some filming with Jeremy Paxman took place in March.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/75148718-13a8-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c?mhq5j=e2 |title=London diary: Jeremy Paxman on heads of state in the age of Trump |last1=Dowell |date=14 July 2017 |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=14 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\nSeries 3 began on 18 September 2017 on [[BBC Two]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| #\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Title\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Directed by\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Written by\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Original air date\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb_30\"/>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |Title=Episode 1\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|9|18|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.83\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |Title=Episode 2\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|9|25|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.56\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=11\n |Title=Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|2|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.82\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=12\n |Title=Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|9|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.5\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=13\n |Title=Episode 5\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|16|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.39\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=14\n |Title=Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|23|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.47\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n|}\n\nAfter the transmission of Episode 1 on [[BBC Two]] Episode 2 was made available on [[BBC iPlayer]] on 18 September 2017.

She is also the founder of The ReThink Group.  Shull focuses on the positive contribution of feelings and emotion in high-pressure decisions.  She is the author of ''Market Mind Games'' which explains how [[Wall Street]] traders act out Freudian transferences in reaction to market moves.  Shull postulates that human perception contains fractal elements in the same manner as the fractal geometry of nature. \n\n== Education ==\n* [[Master of Arts]] 1995 [[Neuropsychoanalysis]] at [[University of Chicago]]\n* [[Executive Education]] in Behavioral Finance at [[Kennedy School of Government]]\n\nShull graduated from Kennedy's executive program in \"Investment Decisions and Behavioral Finance\" in 2009. She holds a Master of Arts from The University of Chicago. Her thesis research, \"The Neurobiology of Freud\u2019s Theory of the Repetition Compulsion\" was published in 2003 in the Annals of Modern Psychoanalysis and was cited in 2013 as one of the first papers ever written in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis.\n\n== Career ==\n* 1983-1988 [[Marketing]] Representative at [[IBM]]\n* 1994-2009 [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[Rossiter Capital]]\n* 2003\u2013present Founder, CEO and Lead Performance Coach at The ReThink Group\n\nShull began working as a short-term trader and trading desk manager in 1994 at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]], and later began trading futures as a member of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]]. During this period Shull began to formulate her application of neuropsychology to investment and trading at banks, hedge funds, and proprietary funds, working in the budding interdisciplinary field of [[neuroeconomics]]. \n\nIn 2003, Shull created The ReThink Group to address the challenges of slumps, repetitive mistakes and confidence crises in portfolio managers and traders. In 2016, ReThink added Olympians, pro poker players and professional athletes to their roster.\n\nShe filed a copyright claim against [[Showtime Networks]] in 2018, claiming their show ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'' plagiarized her 2012 book ''Market Mind Games''.<ref>https://nypost.com/2019/03/02/showtimes-billions-ripped-off-hedge-fund-performance-coach-suit/</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nShull's book ''Market Mind Games: a Radical Psychology of Investing, Trading and Risk'' ([[McGraw-Hill]], 2012) was translated into Chinese in 2013.

She is also the founder of The ReThink Group.  Shull focuses on the positive contribution of feelings and emotion in high-pressure decisions.  She is the author of ''Market Mind Games'' which explains how [[Wall Street]] traders act out Freudian transferences in reaction to market moves.  Shull postulates that human perception contains fractal elements in the same manner as the fractal geometry of nature. \n\n== Education ==\n* [[Master of Arts]] 1995 [[Neuropsychoanalysis]] at [[University of Chicago]]\n* [[Executive Education]] in Behavioral Finance at [[Kennedy School of Government]]\n\nShull graduated from Kennedy's executive program in \"Investment Decisions and Behavioral Finance\" in 2009. She holds a Master of Arts from The University of Chicago. Her thesis research, \"The Neurobiology of Freud\u2019s Theory of the Repetition Compulsion\" was published in 2003 in the Annals of Modern Psychoanalysis and was cited in 2013 as one of the first papers ever written in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis.\n\n== Career ==\n* 1983-1988 [[Marketing]] Representative at [[IBM]]\n* 1994-2009 [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[Rossiter Capital]]\n* 2003\u2013present Founder, CEO and Lead Performance Coach at The ReThink Group\n\nShull began working as a short-term trader and trading desk manager in 1994 at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]], and later began trading futures as a member of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]]. During this period Shull began to formulate her application of neuropsychology to investment and trading at banks, hedge funds, and proprietary funds, working in the budding interdisciplinary field of [[neuroeconomics]]. \n\nIn 2003, Shull created The ReThink Group to address the challenges of slumps, repetitive mistakes and confidence crises in portfolio managers and traders. In 2016, ReThink added Olympians, pro poker players and professional athletes to their roster.\n\nShe filed a copyright claim against [[Showtime Networks]] in 2018, claiming their show ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'' plagiarized her 2012 book ''Market Mind Games''.<ref>https://nypost.com/2019/03/02/showtimes-billions-ripped-off-hedge-fund-performance-coach-suit/</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nShull's book ''Market Mind Games: a Radical Psychology of Investing, Trading and Risk'' ([[McGraw-Hill]], 2012) was translated into Chinese in 2013. She served as the lead author of the chapter on trading psychology in ''Investor Behavior: The Psychology of Financial Planning and Investing'' (Wiley, 2014). Shull's first article \"Freud's Path to Profits\" was published in ''[[SFO Magazine]]'' in 2004, and she has since written articles for ''[[Psychology Today]]'', ''Hedge-Fund Intelligence'', ''[[Thomson Reuters]]'', ''[[CME Group]]'', ''All About Alpha'', and many hedge fund sites as well as her own blog.\n\n== Media appearances ==\nShull's work has been profiled by the ''[[New York Times]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/sports/olympics/lindsey-jacobellis-olympics-snowboard.html|title=The Haunting of Lindsey Jacobellis|first=John|last=Branch|date=February 14, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisacohn/2018/02/05/meet-denise-shull-the-real-life-performance-coach-from-billions/|title=Meet Denise Shull, The Real Life Performance Coach From 'Billions'|first=Alisa|last=Cohn|website=Forbes}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/how-wall-street-coaches-help-traders-stay-calm-and-make-money|title=Mojo mentors: how Wall Street coaches help traders stay calm and make money|first=Jana|last=Kasperkevic|date=January 24, 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''{{cn}}, ''[[University of Chicago Magazine]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mag.uchicago.edu/economics-business/emotional-dividends|title=Emotional dividends|website=The University of Chicago Magazine}}</ref> ''[[Business Insider]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-billionaires-act-when-they-lose-money-2016-2|title=This is what it's like to watch a 'Master of the Universe' lose money|first=Linette|last=Lopez|website=Business Insider}}</ref> ''[[Financial Times]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/080a7f76-bc42-11de-9426-00144feab49a#axzz20cmvyBt3|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref> ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', ''[[New York Observer]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2016/02/wall-street-shrink-puts-wendy-rhoades-from-billions-on-the-couch/|title=Wall Street Shrink Puts Wendy Rhoades From \u2018Billions\u2019 on the Couch|date=February 5, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''The New York Times' Dealbook,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/for-better-performance-hedge-funds-seek-the-inner-trader/|title=For Better Performance, Hedge Funds Seek the Inner Trader|first=Alexandra|last=Stevenson|date=November 11, 2013|website=DealBook}}</ref> ''[[New York Post]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/25/fear-of-making-more-money-than-your-parents-is-killing-your-career/|title=Wall Street shrinks reveal their get-rich-quick secrets|first=Michael|last=Kaplan|date=February 25, 2016}}</ref> and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-new-highs-in-the-stoc_b_2959103|title=Why Stock Market Highs Beget More New Highs|date=March 28, 2013|website=HuffPost}}</ref> amongst others.''

Polls prior to the conclusion of the Democratic primary (which included his rivals to the nomination) had Moon at around 30% support, and polls conducted after he had won the primary showed generally consistent results of around 40% by April.\n\nPolling showed a significant decline in support for Ahn Cheol-soo during April. While at the beginning of the month he was polling close to Moon, and even exceeded him in a few polls, by May his support had dropped to around 20%. This decline coincided with rising support for Hong Jun-pyo. By the time of the polling blackout period began on 3 May, Ahn and Hong were recording similar levels of support.\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image_style=border:none\n|total_width =

Polls prior to the conclusion of the Democratic primary (which included his rivals to the nomination) had Moon at around 30% support, and polls conducted after he had won the primary showed generally consistent results of around 40% by April.\n\nPolling showed a significant decline in support for Ahn Cheol-soo during April. While at the beginning of the month he was polling close to Moon, and even exceeded him in a few polls, by May his support had dropped to around 20%. This decline coincided with rising support for Hong Jun-pyo. By the time of the polling blackout period began on 3 May, Ahn and Hong were recording similar levels of support.\n{{multiple image\n|align=center\n|image_style=border:none\n|total_width =
