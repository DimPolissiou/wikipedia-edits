However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it.\" During the [[Comedy Central Roast]] of Shatner on August 20, 2006, Nichols jokingly referred to the kiss and said, \"what do you say, let's make a little more TV history ...

Nichols has co-starred in six ''Star Trek'' films, the last one being ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''.\n\n=== Other acting roles ===\n[[File:NichelleNicholsHWOFSept2012.jpg|thumb|right|Nichols in September 2012.]]\nIn 1994, Nichols published her autobiography ''Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories''. In it, she claimed that the role of Peggy Fair in the television series ''[[Mannix]]'' was offered to her during the final season of ''Star Trek'', but producer Gene Roddenberry refused to release her from her contract. Between the end of the original series and the ''Star Trek'' animated series and feature films, Nichols appeared in small television and film roles. She briefly appeared as a secretary in ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), and portrayed a foul-mouthed madam in ''[[Truck Turner]]'' (1974) opposite [[Isaac Hayes]], her only appearance in a [[blaxploitation]] film.\n\nNichols appeared in animated form as one of [[Al Gore]]'s Vice Presidential Action Rangers in the \"[[Anthology of Interest I]]\" episode of ''[[Futurama]]'', and she provided the voice of her own head in a glass jar in the episode \"[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]\". She voiced the recurring role of [[Elisa Maza]]'s mother Diane Maza in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', and played Thoth-Kopeira in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. In 2004, she provided the voice for herself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Simple Simpson]]\". In the comedy film ''[[Snow Dogs]]'' (2002), Nichols appeared as the mother of the male lead, played by [[Cuba Gooding Jr]]. In 2006, she appeared as the title character in the film ''[[Lady Magdalene's]]'', the madam of a legal Nevada brothel in tax default. She also served as executive producer and choreographer, and sang three songs in the film, two of which she composed. In addition to her acting skills, Nichols is an accomplished dancer and singer. She has twice been nominated for the Chicago theatrical [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for Best Actress.

These two very distinct regions would be heavily governed by the military and followed the demands handed down by the governor of Egypt and imposed by the heads of their communities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEgypt was ruled by various dynasties from the start of Islamic control in 639 until the (brief) end of it in the early 16th century. The Umayyad period lasted from 658 until 750. Next came the [[Abbasid]] period which focused  on taxes and centralizing power. In 868 the [[Tulunid]]s, ruled by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], expanded Egypt's territory into the Levant. He would rule until his death in 884. After years of turmoil under Ahmad ibn Tulun's successor, many citizens defected back to the Abbasids and in 904 they would reclaim power from the Tulunids.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Prophet and the age of the Caliphates : the Islamic Near East from the sixth to the eleventh century|last=N.)|first=Kennedy, Hugh (Hugh|date=2004|publisher=Pearson/Longman|isbn=0582405254|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow, England|oclc=55792252}}</ref> In 969 Egypt came under the control of the Western caliphate and the [[Fatimids]]. This dynasty would begin to fade after the death of their last caliph in 1171.\n\nIn 1174, Egypt came under the rule of [[Ayyubid]]s. The Ayyubids ruled from Damascus, not the Fatimid city of Cairo. This dynasty fought against the Crusader States during the Fifth Crusade. Ayyubid caliph Najm al-Din recaptured Jerusalem in 1240. He introduced Mamluk forces into his army in order to hold off the crusaders. This decision would be one he regretted.\n\nThe Ayyubids were overthrown by their bodyguards, known as the [[Mamluk]]s in 1252. The Mamluks  ruled under the suzerainty of Abbasid Caliphs until 1517, when Egypt became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as Ey\u0101let-i M\u0131\u1e63r province.[[File:Ancient_Egypt_map-en.svg|thumb|Map of Ancient Egypt]]\n\n==Early Islamic period==\n\n===Muslim conquest of Egypt===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of Egypt}}\n[[Image:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|250px|The Age of the Caliphs {{legend|#a1584e|Prophet Mohammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Patriarchal Caliphate, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}]]\nIn 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent against Egypt by the second caliph, [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Umar]], under the command of [[Amr ibn al-As]]. This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] army at the battle of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. Amr next proceeded in the direction of [[Alexandria]], which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on November 8, 641. Alexandria was regained for the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repulsed. From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.\n\n===Administration of early Islamic Egypt===\nFollowing the first surrender of Alexandria, Amr chose a new site to settle his men, near the location of the Byzantine fortress of [[Babylon (fortress)|Babylon]]. The new settlement received the name of [[Fustat]], after Amr's tent, which had been pitched there when the Arabs besieged the fortress.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=64}} Fustat quickly became the focal point of Islamic Egypt, and, with the exception of the brief relocation to [[Helwan]] during a plague in 689, and the period of 750\u2013763, when the seat of the governor moved to [[Al-Askar|Askar]], the capital and residence of the administration.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=102}} After the conquest, the country was initially divided in two provinces, [[Upper Egypt]] (''al-sa'id'') and [[Lower Egypt]] with the [[Nile Delta]] (''asfal al-ard''). In 643/4, however, Caliph [[Uthman]] appointed a single governor (''[[wali|w\u0101li]]'') with jurisdiction over all of Egypt, resident at Fustat. The governor would in turn nominate deputies for Upper and Lower Egypt.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=101\u2013102}} Alexandria remained a distinct district, reflecting both its role as the country's shield against Byzantine attacks, and as the major naval base. It was considered a frontier fortress (''[[ribat]]'') under a military governor and was heavily garrisoned, with a quarter of the province's garrison serving there in semi-annual rotation.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=102\u2013103}} Next to the ''w\u0101li'', there was also the commander of the police (''[[sahib al-shurta|\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib al-shur\u1e6da]]''), responsible for internal security and for commanding the ''[[jund]]'' (army).{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe main pillar of the early Muslim rule and control in the country was the military force, or ''jund'', staffed by the Arab settlers. These were initially the men who had followed Amr and participated in the conquest.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=104}} The followers of Amr were mostly drawn from Yamani ([[south Arabia]]n) tribes, rather than the northern Arab ([[Qays]]i) tribes, who were scarcely represented in the province; it was they who dominated the country's affairs for the first two centuries of Muslim rule.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=64}} Initially, they numbered 15,500, but their numbers grew through emigration in the subsequent decades. By the time of Caliph [[Mu'awiya I]] (r. 661\u2013680), the number of men registered in the army list (''[[divan|diw\u0101n]] al-jund'') and entitled an annual pay (''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'') reached 40,000. Jealous of their privileges and status, which entitled them to a share of the local revenue, the members of the ''jund'' then virtually closed off the register to new entries.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=104}} It was only after the losses of the [[Second Fitna]] that the registers were updated, and occasionally, governors would add soldiers ''en masse'' to the lists as a means to garner political support.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nIn return for a very small tribute of money (0.5% [[Jizya]] Tax on some free men) and food for the troops, the Christian inhabitants of Egypt were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs.\n\nConversions of [[Copt]]s to [[Islam]] were initially rare, and the old system of taxation was maintained for the greater part of the first Islamic century. The old division of the country into districts (''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomoi]]'') was maintained, and to the inhabitants of these districts demands were directly addressed by the governor of Egypt, while the head of the community\u2014ordinarily a Copt but in some cases a Muslim [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]\u2014was responsible for compliance with the demand.\n\n===Umayyad period===\nDuring the [[First Fitna]], Caliph [[Ali]] (r. 656\u2013661) appointed [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] as governor of Egypt, but Amr led an invasion in summer 658 that defeated Ibn Abi Bakr and secured the country for the [[Umayyads]]. Amr then served as governor until his death in 664. From 667/8 until 682, the province was governed by another fervent pro-Umayyad partisan, [[Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=69}} During the [[Second Fitna]], [[Ibn al-Zubayr]] gained the support of the [[Kharijites]] in Egypt and sent a governor of his own, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri]], to the province. The Kharijite-backed Zubayrid regime was very unpopular with the local Arabs, who called upon the Umayyad caliph [[Marwan I]] (r. 684\u2013685) for aid. In December 684, Marwan invaded Egypt and reconquered it with relative ease.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=70}} Marwan installed his son [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan|Abd al-Aziz]] as governor. Relying on his close ties with the ''jund'', Abd al-Aziz ruled the country for 20 years, enjoying wide autonomy and governing as a ''de facto'' [[viceroy]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=65, 70\u201371}} Abd al-Aziz also supervised the completion of the [[Muslim conquest of North Africa]]; it was he who appointed [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] in his post as governor of [[Ifriqiya]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=71}} Abd al-Aziz hoped to be succeeded by his son, but when he died, Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685\u2013695) sent his own son, [[Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik|Abdallah]], as governor in a move to reassert control and prevent the country from becoming a hereditary domain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=71\u201372}}\n\n[[Abd al-Malik ibn Rifa'a al-Fahmi]] in 715 and his successor [[Ayyub ibn Sharhabil]] in 717 were the first governors chosen from the ''jund'', rather than members of the Umayyad family or court. Both are reported to have increased pressure on the Copts, and initiated measures of Islamization.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=73}} The resentment of the Copts against taxation led to a revolt in 725. In 727, to strengthen Arab representation, a colony of 3,000 Arabs was set up near [[Bilbeis]]. Meanwhile, the employment of the [[Arabic language]] had been steadily gaining ground, and in 706 it was made the official language of the government. [[Egyptian Arabic]], the modern Arabic accent of Egypt, began to form. Other revolts of the Copts are recorded for the years 739 and 750, the last year of Umayyad domination. The outbreaks in all cases are attributed to increased taxation.\n\n===Abbasid period===\nThe [[Abbasid]] period was marked by new taxations, and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]], who decided to reside at [[Baghdad]], sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government.\n\nA major change came in 834, when Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] discontinued the practice of paying the ''jund'' as they nominally still formed the province's garrison\u2014the ''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'' from the local revenue. Al-Mu'tasim discontinued the practice, removing the Arab families from the army registers ''diw\u0101n'' and ordering that the revenues of Egypt be sent to the central government, which would then pay the ''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'' only to the Turkish troops stationed in the province. This was a move towards centralizing power in the hands of the central caliphal administration, but also signalled the decline of the old elites, and the passing of power to the officials sent to the province by the Abbasid court, most notably the Turkish soldiers favoured by al-Mu'tasim.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=158\u2013159}} At about the same time, for the first time the Muslim population began surpassing the [[Coptic Christians]] in numbers, and throughout the 9th century the rural districts were increasingly subject to both Arabization and Islamization.{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=550\u2013556}} The rapidity of this process, and the influx of settlers after the discovery of gold and emerald mines at [[Aswan]], meant that [[Upper Egypt]] in particular was only superficially controlled by the local governor.{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=557}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Furthermore, the persistence of internecine strife and turmoil at the heart of the Abbasid state\u2014the so-called \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\"\u2014led to the appearance of [[millennialist]] revolutionary movements in the province under a series of [[Alid]] pretenders in the 870s.{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=558}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=93}} In part, these movements were an expression of dissatisfaction with and alienation from imperial rule by Baghdad; these sentiments would manifest themselves in the support of several Egyptians for the [[Fatimids]] in the 10th century.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n===Tulunid period===\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|200px|Spiral Minaret of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]]]]\nIn 868, Caliph [[al-Mu'tazz]] (r. 866\u2013869) gave charge of Egypt to the Turkish general [[Bakbak]]. Bakbak in turn sent his stepson [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] as his lieutenant and resident governor.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=91}} This appointment ushered in a new era in Egypt's history: hitherto a passive province of an empire, under Ibn Tulun it would re-emerge as an independent political centre. Ibn Tulun would use the country's wealth to extend his rule into the Levant, in a pattern followed by later Egypt-based regimes, from the [[Ikhshidids]] to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]]. {{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=89\u201392, 96}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=312ff.}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=565ff.}}\n\nThe first years of Ibn Tulun's governorship were dominated by his power struggle with the powerful head of the fiscal administration, the [[Abu'l-Hasan Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn al-Mudabbir|Ibn al-Mudabbir]]. The latter had been appointed as fiscal agent (''\u02bf\u0101mil'') already since ca. 861, and had rapidly become the most hated man in the country as he doubled the taxes and imposed new ones on Muslims and [[dhimmi|non-Muslims]] alike.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=92}} By 872 Ibn Tulun had achieved Ibn al-Mudabirbir's dismissal and taken over the management of the fisc himself, and had managed to assemble an army of his own, thereby becoming ''de facto'' independent of Baghdad.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=92, 94}} As a sign of his power, he established a new palace city to the northeast of Fustat, called [[al-Qata'i]], in 870. The project was a conscious emulation of, and rival to, the Abbasid capital Samarra, with quarters assigned to the regiments of his army, a hippodrome, hospital, and palaces. The new city's centrepiece was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]].{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=559\u2013560}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} Ibn Tulun continued to emulate the familiar Samarra model in the establishment of his administration as well, creating new departments and entrusting them to Samarra-trained officials.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}} His regime was in many ways typical of the \"''ghul\u0101m'' system\" that became one of the two main paradigms of Islamic polities in the 9th and 10th centuries, as the Abbasid Caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged. These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of slave soldiers or ''ghilm\u0101n'', but in turn, according to [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], \"the paying of the troops was the major preoccupation of government\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=560}} It is therefore in the context of the increased financial requirements that in 879, the supervision of the finances passed to [[Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i]], the founder of the [[al-Madhara'i]] bureaucratic dynasty that dominated the fiscal apparatus of Egypt for the next 70 years.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=560}} The peace and security provided by the Tulunid regime, the establishment of an efficient administration, and repairs and expansions to the irrigation system, coupled with a consistently high level of [[Nile floods]], resulted in a major increase in revenue. By the end of his reign, Ibn Tulun had accumulated a reserve of ten million dinars.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=98}}\n\nIbn Tulun's rise was facilitated by the feebleness of the Abbasid government, threatened by the rise of the [[Saffarids]] in the east and by the [[Zanj Rebellion]] in Iraq itself, and divided due to the rivalry between Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] (r. 870\u2013892) and his increasingly powerful brother and ''de facto'' regent, [[al-Muwaffaq]].{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=94\u201395}} Open conflict between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq broke out in 875/6. The latter tried to oust Ibn Tulun from Egypt, but the expedition sent against him barely reached Syria. In retaliation, with the support of the Caliph, in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the frontier districts of [[Cilicia]] (the ''[[Thughur|Thugh\u016br]]''). Ibn Tulun occupied Syria but failed to seize [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in Cilicia, and was forced to return to Egypt due to the abortive revolt of his eldest son, [[al-Abbas ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Abbas]]. Ibn Tulun has Abbas imprisoned, and named his second son, [[Khumarawayh]], as his heir.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=95\u201399}} In 882, Ibn Tulun came close to having Egypt become the new centre of the Caliphate, when al-Mu'tamid tried to flee to his domains. In the event, however, the Caliph was overtaken and brought him back to Samarra (February 883) and under his brother's control. This opened anew the rift between the two rulers: Ibn Tulun organized an assembly of religious jurists at Damascus which denounced al-Muwaffaq a usurper, condemned his maltreatment of the Caliph, declared his place in the succession as void, and called for a ''[[jihad|jih\u0101d]]'' against him. Al-Muwaffaq was duly denounced in [[khutbah|sermons]] in the mosques across the Tulunid domains, while the Abbasid regent responded in kind with a ritual denunciation of Ibn Tulun.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=100\u2013102}} Ibn Tulun then tried once more, again without success, to impose his rule over Tarsus. He fell ill on his return journey to Egypt, and died at Fustat on 10 May 884.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of the Tulunid domains towards the end of Khumarawayh's reign]]\nAt Ibn Tulun's death, Khumarawayh, with the backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded without opposition.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=104}} Ibn Tulun bequeathed his heir \"with a seasoned military, a stable economy, and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats\". Khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against the Abbasid attempt to overthrow him at the [[Battle of Tawahin]] and even made additional territorial gains, recognized in a treaty with al-Muwaffaq in 886 that gave the Tulunids the hereditary governorship over Egypt and Syria for 30 years.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=104\u2013105}} The accession of al-Muwaffaq's son [[al-Mu'tadid]] as Caliph in 892 marked a new rapprochement, culminating in the marriage of Khumarawayh's daughter to the new Caliph, but also the return of the provinces of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] and [[Diyar Mudar]] to caliphal control.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=105\u2013106}} Domestically, Khumarawayh's reign was one of \"luxury and decay\" ([[Hugh N. Kennedy]]), but also a time of relative tranquility in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period. Nevertheless, Khumarawayh's extravagant spending exhausted the fisc, and by the time of his assassination in 896, the Tulunid treasury was empty.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} Following Khumarawayh's death, internal strife sapped Tulunid power. Khumarawayh's son [[Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh]] was a drunkard who executed his uncle, Mudar ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun; he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]. Harun too was a weak ruler, and although a revolt by his uncle [[Rabi'ah ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Rabi'ah]] in Alexandria was suppressed, the Tulunids were unable to confront the attacks of the [[Qarmatians]] who began at the same time. In addition, many commanders defected to the Abbasids, whose power revived under the capable leadership of al-Muwaffaq's son, Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892\u2013902). Finally, in December 904, two other sons of Ibn Tulun, Ali and [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Shayban]], murdered their nephew and assumed control of the Tulunid state. Far from halting the decline, this event alienated key commanders in Syria and led to the rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of Syria and Egypt by the Abbasids under [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], who entered Fustat in January 905. With the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the victorious Abbasid troops pillaged al-Qata'i and razed it to the ground.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=106\u2013108}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=184\u2013185, 310}}\n\n===Second Abbasid period and Ikhshidid period===\nThe Abbasids were able to repulse [[Fatimid]] invasions of Egypt in [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (914\u2013915)|914\u2013915]] and [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|919\u2013921]]. \n\nIn 935, after repulsing another Fatimid attack, the Turkish commander [[Muhammad ibn Tughj]] became the ''de facto'' ruler of Egypt with the title of ''al-Ikhshid''.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=112}} After his death in 946, the succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|invaded and conquered Egypt]], beginning a new era in the country's history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=312\u2013313}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\n==Fatimid period==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\n{{main|Fatimid Caliphate}}\n[[Image:NE 1025ad.jpg|thumb|350px|The near East in 1025 AD, showing the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and neighbors.]]\n[[Jawhar as-Siqilli]] immediately began the building of a new city, [[Cairo]], to furnish quarters for the army which he had brought. A palace for the Caliph and a [[mosque]] for the army were immediately constructed, which for many centuries remained the centre of Muslim learning. However, the [[Carmathians]] of [[Damascus]] under [[Hasan al-Asam]] advanced through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Egypt, and in the autumn of 971 Jauhar found himself besieged in his new city. By a timely sortie, preceded by the administration of bribes to various officers in the Carmathian host, Jauhar succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat on the besiegers, who were compelled to evacuate Egypt and part of Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the caliph in 2 [[Ma'ad al-Muizz Li-Deenillah|al-Muizz]] had been summoned to enter the palace that had been prepared for him, and after leaving a viceroy to take charge of his western possessions he arrived in Alexandria on May 31 973, and proceeded to instruct his new subjects in the particular form of religion ([[Shiism]]) which his family represented. As this was in origin identical with that professed by the Carmathians, he hoped to gain the submission of their leader by argument; but this plan was unsuccessful, and there was a fresh invasion from that quarter in the year after his arrival, and the caliph found himself besieged in his capital.\n\nThe Carmathians were gradually forced to retreat from Egypt and then from Syria by some successful engagements, and by the judicious use of bribes, whereby dissension was sown among their leaders. Al-Muizz also found time to take some active measures against the Byzantines, with whom his generals fought in Syria with varying fortune. Before his death he was acknowledged as Caliph in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], as well as Syria, Egypt and [[North Africa]] as far as [[Tangier]].\n\nUnder the [[vizier]] [[Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah|al-Aziz]], there was a large amount of toleration conceded to the other sects of Islam, and to other communities, but the belief that the Christians of Egypt were in league with the [[Byzantine emperor]], and even burned a fleet which was being built for the Byzantine war, led to some persecution. Al-Aziz attempted without success to enter into friendly relations with the [[Buwayhid]] ruler of Baghdad, and tried to gain possession of [[Aleppo]], as the key to [[Iraq]], but this was prevented by the intervention of the Byzantines. His North African possessions were maintained and extended, but the recognition of the Fatimid caliph in this region was little more than nominal.\n\n[[File:Al-Azhar (inside) 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Al-Azhar Mosque]], of medieval Fatimid [[Cairo]].]]\nHis successor [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] came to the throne at the age of eleven, being the son of Aziz by a Christian mother. His conduct of affairs was vigorous and successful, and he concluded a peace with the Byzantine emperor. He is perhaps best remembered by his destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] (1009), a measure which helped to provoke the [[Crusades]], but was only part of a general scheme for converting all Christians and [[Jew]]s in his dominions to his own opinions by force.\n\nA more reputable expedient with the same end in view was the construction of a great [[library]] in Cairo, with ample provision for students; this was modelled on a similar institution at Baghdad. His system of persecution was not abandoned till in the last year of his reign (1020) he thought fit to claim divinity,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} a doctrine which is perpetuated by the [[Druze]], called after one Darazi, who preached the divinity of al-Hakim at the time. For unknown reasons al-Hakim disappeared in 1021.\n\nIn 1049 the [[Zirid]] dynasty in the Maghrib returned to the [[Sunni]] faith and became subjects of the Caliphate in Baghdad, but at the same time [[Yemen]] recognized the Fatimid caliphate. Meanwhile, Baghdad was taken by the Turks, falling to the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Tughrul Beg]] in 1059. The Turks also plundered Cairo in 1068, but they were driven out by 1074. During this time, however, Syria was overrun by an invader in league with the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]], and Damascus was permanently lost to the Fatimids. This period is otherwise memorable for the rise of the [[Hashshashin]], or Assassins.\n\nDuring the [[Crusade]]s, al-Mustafa maintained himself in Alexandria, and helped the Crusaders by rescuing Jerusalem from the [[Ortokids]], thereby facilitating its conquest by the Crusaders in 1099. He endeavoured to retrieve his error by himself advancing into Palestine, but he was defeated at the [[battle of Ascalon]], and compelled to retire to Egypt. Many of the Palestinian possessions of the Fatimids then successively fell into the hands of the Crusaders.\n\nIn 1118 Egypt was invaded by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], who burned the gates and the mosques of Farama, and advanced to [[Tinnis]], when illness compelled him to retreat. In August 1121 [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] was assassinated in a street of Cairo, it is said, with the connivance of the Caliph, who immediately began the plunder of his house, where fabulous treasures were said to be amassed. The vizier's offices were given to al-Mamn. His external policy was not more fortunate than that of his predecessor, as he lost [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] to the Crusaders, and a fleet equipped by him was defeated by the [[Venice|Venetians]].\n\nIn 1153 [[Siege of Ascalon|Ascalon was lost]], the last place in Syria which the Fatimids held; its loss was attributed to dissensions between the parties of which the garrison consisted. In April 1154 the Caliph al-Zafir was murdered by his vizier Abbas, according to [[Usamah ibn Munqidh|Usamah]], because the Caliph had suggested to his favorite, the vizier's son, to murder his father; and this was followed by a massacre of the brothers of Zafir, followed by the raising of his infant son [[Al-Faiz|Abul-Qasim Isa]] to the throne.\n\nIn December 1162, the vizier [[Shawar]] took control of Cairo.  However, after only nine months he was compelled to flee to Damascus, where he was favorably received by the prince [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nureddin]], who sent with him to Cairo a force of [[Kurd]]s under Asad al-din [[Shirkuh]]. At the same time Egypt was [[Crusader invasion of Egypt|invaded by the Franks]], who raided and did much damage on the coast. Shawar recaptured Cairo but a dispute then arose with his Syrian allies for the possession of Egypt. Shawar, being unable to cope with the Syrians, demanded help of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]] [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], who hastened to his aid with a large force, which united with Shawar's and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis for three months; at the end of this time, owing to the successes of Nureddin in Syria, the Franks granted Shirkuh a free passage with his troops back to Syria, on condition of Egypt being evacuated (October 1164).<ref>{{cite book|title=''The Crusades Through Arab Eyes''|author=Amin Maalouf|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crusadesthrougha00maal_0/page/159 159\u2013161]|year=1984|publisher=Al Saqi Books|isbn=0-8052-0898-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/crusadesthrougha00maal_0/page/159}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later [[Shirkuh]], a Kurdish general known as \"the Lion\", persuaded Nureddin to put him at the head of another expedition to Egypt, which left Syria in January 1167; a Frankish army hastened to Shawar's aid. At the battle of Babain (April 11, 1167) the allies were defeated by the forces commanded by Shirkuh and his nephew [[Saladin]], who was made prefect of Alexandria, which surrendered to Shirkuh without a struggle. In 1168 Amalric invaded again, but Shirkuh's return caused the Crusaders to withdraw.\n\nShirkuh was appointed vizier but died of indigestion (March 23, 1169), and the Caliph appointed Saladin as successor to Shirkuh; the new vizier professed to hold office as a deputy of Nureddin, whose name was mentioned in public worship after that of the Caliph. Nureddin loyally aided his deputy in dealing with Crusader invasions of Egypt, and he ordered Saladin to substitute the name of the Abbasid caliph for the Fatimid in public worship. The last Fatimid caliph died soon after in September, 1171.\n\n==Ayyubid period==<!-- This section is linked from [[Byzantine Empire]] -->\n{{main|Ayyubid dynasty}}\n[[Image:Ayyubid Dynasty 1171 - 1246(AD).PNG|thumb|350px|The [[Ayyubid Empire]] at its greatest extent]]\n\nSaladin, a general known as \"the Lion\", was confirmed as Nureddin's deputy in Egypt, and on the death of Nureddin on April 12, 1174 he took the title [[sultan]]. During his reign Damascus, rather than Cairo, was the major city of the empire. Nevertheless, he fortified Cairo, which became the political centre of Egypt. It was in 1183 that Saladin's rule over Egypt and North Syria was consolidated. Much of Saladin's time was spent in Syria, where he fought the [[Crusader States]], and Egypt was largely governed by his deputy [[Karaksh]].\n\nSaladin's son [[al-Aziz Uthman|Othman]] succeeded him in Egypt in 1193. He allied with his uncle (Saladin's brother) [[Al-Adil I]] against Saladin's other sons, and after the wars that followed, Al-Adil took power in 1200. He died in 1218 during the siege of [[Damietta]] in the [[Fifth Crusade]], and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]], who lost Damietta to the Crusaders in 1219. However, he defeated their advance to Cairo by flooding the Nile, and they were forced to evacuate Egypt in 1221. Al-Kamil was later forced to give up various cities in Palestina and Syria to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] during the [[Sixth Crusade]], in order to gain his help against Damascus.\n\n[[As-Salih Ayyub|Najm al-Din]] became sultan in 1240. His reign saw the recapture of Jerusalem in 1244, and the introduction of a larger force of [[Mameluks]] into the army. Much of his time was spent in campaigns in Syria, where he allied with the [[Khwarezmia]]ns against the Crusaders and Ayyubids. In 1249 he faced an invasion by [[Louis IX of France]] (the [[Seventh Crusade]]), and Damietta was lost again.

The first of these was [[Aybak]], who married [[Shajar al-Durr]] (the widow of [[al-Salih Ayyub]]) and quickly began a war with Syria. He was assassinated in 1257 and was succeeded by [[Qutuz]], who faced a growing danger from the [[Mongols]]\n\nQutuz defeated the army of [[Hulagu Khan]] at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260, allowing him to regain all of Syria except Crusader strongholds. On the way back to Egypt after the battle, Qutuz died and was succeeded by another commander, [[Baybars]], who assumed the Sultanate and ruled from 1260 to 1277. In 1291 [[al-Ashraf Khalil]] captured Acre, the last of the crusader cities.\n\nThe Bahris greatly enhanced the power and prestige of Egypt, building [[Cairo]] from a small town into one of the foremost cities in the world. Due to the sacking of [[Baghdad]] by the Mongols, Cairo became the central city of the [[Islamic world]]. The Mamluks built much of the earliest remaining architecture of Cairo, including many [[mosque]]s built out of stone using long, imposing lines.\n\nSince 1347 the [[Egyptians|Egyptian population]], economy, and political system experienced significant destruction as a result of the [[Black Death]]<nowiki/> pandemic whose waves continued to destroy Egypt up to the early 16th century.[[File:Mamluke.jpg|thumb]]In 1377 a revolt in Syria spread to Egypt, and the government was taken over by the [[Circassians]] Berekeh and [[Barkuk]].

In 868 the [[Tulunid]]s, ruled by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], expanded Egypt's territory into the Levant. He would rule until his death in 884.

This dynasty fought against the Crusader States during the Fifth Crusade. Ayyubid caliph Najm al-Din recaptured Jerusalem in 1240. He introduced Mamluk forces into his army in order to hold off the crusaders. This decision would be one he regretted.\n\nThe Ayyubids were overthrown by their bodyguards, known as the [[Mamluk]]s in 1252. The Mamluks  ruled under the suzerainty of Abbasid Caliphs until 1517, when Egypt became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as Ey\u0101let-i M\u0131\u1e63r province.[[File:Ancient_Egypt_map-en.svg|thumb|Map of Ancient Egypt]]\n\n==Early Islamic period==\n\n===Muslim conquest of Egypt===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of Egypt}}\n[[Image:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|250px|The Age of the Caliphs {{legend|#a1584e|Prophet Mohammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Patriarchal Caliphate, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}]]\nIn 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent against Egypt by the second caliph, [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Umar]], under the command of [[Amr ibn al-As]]. This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] army at the battle of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. Amr next proceeded in the direction of [[Alexandria]], which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on November 8, 641. Alexandria was regained for the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repulsed. From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.\n\n===Administration of early Islamic Egypt===\nFollowing the first surrender of Alexandria, Amr chose a new site to settle his men, near the location of the Byzantine fortress of [[Babylon (fortress)|Babylon]]. The new settlement received the name of [[Fustat]], after Amr's tent, which had been pitched there when the Arabs besieged the fortress.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=64}} Fustat quickly became the focal point of Islamic Egypt, and, with the exception of the brief relocation to [[Helwan]] during a plague in 689, and the period of 750\u2013763, when the seat of the governor moved to [[Al-Askar|Askar]], the capital and residence of the administration.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=102}} After the conquest, the country was initially divided in two provinces, [[Upper Egypt]] (''al-sa'id'') and [[Lower Egypt]] with the [[Nile Delta]] (''asfal al-ard''). In 643/4, however, Caliph [[Uthman]] appointed a single governor (''[[wali|w\u0101li]]'') with jurisdiction over all of Egypt, resident at Fustat. The governor would in turn nominate deputies for Upper and Lower Egypt.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=101\u2013102}} Alexandria remained a distinct district, reflecting both its role as the country's shield against Byzantine attacks, and as the major naval base. It was considered a frontier fortress (''[[ribat]]'') under a military governor and was heavily garrisoned, with a quarter of the province's garrison serving there in semi-annual rotation.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=102\u2013103}} Next to the ''w\u0101li'', there was also the commander of the police (''[[sahib al-shurta|\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib al-shur\u1e6da]]''), responsible for internal security and for commanding the ''[[jund]]'' (army).{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe main pillar of the early Muslim rule and control in the country was the military force, or ''jund'', staffed by the Arab settlers. These were initially the men who had followed Amr and participated in the conquest.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=104}} The followers of Amr were mostly drawn from Yamani ([[south Arabia]]n) tribes, rather than the northern Arab ([[Qays]]i) tribes, who were scarcely represented in the province; it was they who dominated the country's affairs for the first two centuries of Muslim rule.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=64}} Initially, they numbered 15,500, but their numbers grew through emigration in the subsequent decades. By the time of Caliph [[Mu'awiya I]] (r. 661\u2013680), the number of men registered in the army list (''[[divan|diw\u0101n]] al-jund'') and entitled an annual pay (''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'') reached 40,000. Jealous of their privileges and status, which entitled them to a share of the local revenue, the members of the ''jund'' then virtually closed off the register to new entries.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|Athamina|1997|p=104}} It was only after the losses of the [[Second Fitna]] that the registers were updated, and occasionally, governors would add soldiers ''en masse'' to the lists as a means to garner political support.{{sfn|Athamina|1997|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nIn return for a very small tribute of money (0.5% [[Jizya]] Tax on some free men) and food for the troops, the Christian inhabitants of Egypt were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs.\n\nConversions of [[Copt]]s to [[Islam]] were initially rare, and the old system of taxation was maintained for the greater part of the first Islamic century. The old division of the country into districts (''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomoi]]'') was maintained, and to the inhabitants of these districts demands were directly addressed by the governor of Egypt, while the head of the community\u2014ordinarily a Copt but in some cases a Muslim [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]\u2014was responsible for compliance with the demand.\n\n===Umayyad period===\nDuring the [[First Fitna]], Caliph [[Ali]] (r. 656\u2013661) appointed [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] as governor of Egypt, but Amr led an invasion in summer 658 that defeated Ibn Abi Bakr and secured the country for the [[Umayyads]]. Amr then served as governor until his death in 664. From 667/8 until 682, the province was governed by another fervent pro-Umayyad partisan, [[Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=69}} During the [[Second Fitna]], [[Ibn al-Zubayr]] gained the support of the [[Kharijites]] in Egypt and sent a governor of his own, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri]], to the province. The Kharijite-backed Zubayrid regime was very unpopular with the local Arabs, who called upon the Umayyad caliph [[Marwan I]] (r. 684\u2013685) for aid. In December 684, Marwan invaded Egypt and reconquered it with relative ease.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=70}} Marwan installed his son [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan|Abd al-Aziz]] as governor. Relying on his close ties with the ''jund'', Abd al-Aziz ruled the country for 20 years, enjoying wide autonomy and governing as a ''de facto'' [[viceroy]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=65, 70\u201371}} Abd al-Aziz also supervised the completion of the [[Muslim conquest of North Africa]]; it was he who appointed [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] in his post as governor of [[Ifriqiya]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=71}} Abd al-Aziz hoped to be succeeded by his son, but when he died, Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685\u2013695) sent his own son, [[Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik|Abdallah]], as governor in a move to reassert control and prevent the country from becoming a hereditary domain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=71\u201372}}\n\n[[Abd al-Malik ibn Rifa'a al-Fahmi]] in 715 and his successor [[Ayyub ibn Sharhabil]] in 717 were the first governors chosen from the ''jund'', rather than members of the Umayyad family or court. Both are reported to have increased pressure on the Copts, and initiated measures of Islamization.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=73}} The resentment of the Copts against taxation led to a revolt in 725. In 727, to strengthen Arab representation, a colony of 3,000 Arabs was set up near [[Bilbeis]]. Meanwhile, the employment of the [[Arabic language]] had been steadily gaining ground, and in 706 it was made the official language of the government. [[Egyptian Arabic]], the modern Arabic accent of Egypt, began to form. Other revolts of the Copts are recorded for the years 739 and 750, the last year of Umayyad domination. The outbreaks in all cases are attributed to increased taxation.\n\n===Abbasid period===\nThe [[Abbasid]] period was marked by new taxations, and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]], who decided to reside at [[Baghdad]], sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government.\n\nA major change came in 834, when Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] discontinued the practice of paying the ''jund'' as they nominally still formed the province's garrison\u2014the ''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'' from the local revenue. Al-Mu'tasim discontinued the practice, removing the Arab families from the army registers ''diw\u0101n'' and ordering that the revenues of Egypt be sent to the central government, which would then pay the ''\u02bfa\u1e6d\u0101\u02be'' only to the Turkish troops stationed in the province. This was a move towards centralizing power in the hands of the central caliphal administration, but also signalled the decline of the old elites, and the passing of power to the officials sent to the province by the Abbasid court, most notably the Turkish soldiers favoured by al-Mu'tasim.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=158\u2013159}} At about the same time, for the first time the Muslim population began surpassing the [[Coptic Christians]] in numbers, and throughout the 9th century the rural districts were increasingly subject to both Arabization and Islamization.{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=550\u2013556}} The rapidity of this process, and the influx of settlers after the discovery of gold and emerald mines at [[Aswan]], meant that [[Upper Egypt]] in particular was only superficially controlled by the local governor.{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=557}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Furthermore, the persistence of internecine strife and turmoil at the heart of the Abbasid state\u2014the so-called \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\"\u2014led to the appearance of [[millennialist]] revolutionary movements in the province under a series of [[Alid]] pretenders in the 870s.{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=558}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=93}} In part, these movements were an expression of dissatisfaction with and alienation from imperial rule by Baghdad; these sentiments would manifest themselves in the support of several Egyptians for the [[Fatimids]] in the 10th century.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n===Tulunid period===\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|200px|Spiral Minaret of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]]]]\nIn 868, Caliph [[al-Mu'tazz]] (r. 866\u2013869) gave charge of Egypt to the Turkish general [[Bakbak]]. Bakbak in turn sent his stepson [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] as his lieutenant and resident governor.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=91}} This appointment ushered in a new era in Egypt's history: hitherto a passive province of an empire, under Ibn Tulun it would re-emerge as an independent political centre. Ibn Tulun would use the country's wealth to extend his rule into the Levant, in a pattern followed by later Egypt-based regimes, from the [[Ikhshidids]] to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]]. {{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=89\u201392, 96}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=312ff.}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=565ff.}}\n\nThe first years of Ibn Tulun's governorship were dominated by his power struggle with the powerful head of the fiscal administration, the [[Abu'l-Hasan Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn al-Mudabbir|Ibn al-Mudabbir]]. The latter had been appointed as fiscal agent (''\u02bf\u0101mil'') already since ca. 861, and had rapidly become the most hated man in the country as he doubled the taxes and imposed new ones on Muslims and [[dhimmi|non-Muslims]] alike.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=92}} By 872 Ibn Tulun had achieved Ibn al-Mudabirbir's dismissal and taken over the management of the fisc himself, and had managed to assemble an army of his own, thereby becoming ''de facto'' independent of Baghdad.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=92, 94}} As a sign of his power, he established a new palace city to the northeast of Fustat, called [[al-Qata'i]], in 870. The project was a conscious emulation of, and rival to, the Abbasid capital Samarra, with quarters assigned to the regiments of his army, a hippodrome, hospital, and palaces. The new city's centrepiece was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]].{{sfn|Brett|2010|pp=559\u2013560}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} Ibn Tulun continued to emulate the familiar Samarra model in the establishment of his administration as well, creating new departments and entrusting them to Samarra-trained officials.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}} His regime was in many ways typical of the \"''ghul\u0101m'' system\" that became one of the two main paradigms of Islamic polities in the 9th and 10th centuries, as the Abbasid Caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged. These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of slave soldiers or ''ghilm\u0101n'', but in turn, according to [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], \"the paying of the troops was the major preoccupation of government\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=560}} It is therefore in the context of the increased financial requirements that in 879, the supervision of the finances passed to [[Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i]], the founder of the [[al-Madhara'i]] bureaucratic dynasty that dominated the fiscal apparatus of Egypt for the next 70 years.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=97}}{{sfn|Brett|2010|p=560}} The peace and security provided by the Tulunid regime, the establishment of an efficient administration, and repairs and expansions to the irrigation system, coupled with a consistently high level of [[Nile floods]], resulted in a major increase in revenue. By the end of his reign, Ibn Tulun had accumulated a reserve of ten million dinars.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=98}}\n\nIbn Tulun's rise was facilitated by the feebleness of the Abbasid government, threatened by the rise of the [[Saffarids]] in the east and by the [[Zanj Rebellion]] in Iraq itself, and divided due to the rivalry between Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] (r. 870\u2013892) and his increasingly powerful brother and ''de facto'' regent, [[al-Muwaffaq]].{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=94\u201395}} Open conflict between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq broke out in 875/6. The latter tried to oust Ibn Tulun from Egypt, but the expedition sent against him barely reached Syria. In retaliation, with the support of the Caliph, in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the frontier districts of [[Cilicia]] (the ''[[Thughur|Thugh\u016br]]''). Ibn Tulun occupied Syria but failed to seize [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in Cilicia, and was forced to return to Egypt due to the abortive revolt of his eldest son, [[al-Abbas ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Abbas]]. Ibn Tulun has Abbas imprisoned, and named his second son, [[Khumarawayh]], as his heir.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=95\u201399}} In 882, Ibn Tulun came close to having Egypt become the new centre of the Caliphate, when al-Mu'tamid tried to flee to his domains. In the event, however, the Caliph was overtaken and brought him back to Samarra (February 883) and under his brother's control. This opened anew the rift between the two rulers: Ibn Tulun organized an assembly of religious jurists at Damascus which denounced al-Muwaffaq a usurper, condemned his maltreatment of the Caliph, declared his place in the succession as void, and called for a ''[[jihad|jih\u0101d]]'' against him. Al-Muwaffaq was duly denounced in [[khutbah|sermons]] in the mosques across the Tulunid domains, while the Abbasid regent responded in kind with a ritual denunciation of Ibn Tulun.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=100\u2013102}} Ibn Tulun then tried once more, again without success, to impose his rule over Tarsus. He fell ill on his return journey to Egypt, and died at Fustat on 10 May 884.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of the Tulunid domains towards the end of Khumarawayh's reign]]\nAt Ibn Tulun's death, Khumarawayh, with the backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded without opposition.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=104}} Ibn Tulun bequeathed his heir \"with a seasoned military, a stable economy, and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats\". Khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against the Abbasid attempt to overthrow him at the [[Battle of Tawahin]] and even made additional territorial gains, recognized in a treaty with al-Muwaffaq in 886 that gave the Tulunids the hereditary governorship over Egypt and Syria for 30 years.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=104\u2013105}} The accession of al-Muwaffaq's son [[al-Mu'tadid]] as Caliph in 892 marked a new rapprochement, culminating in the marriage of Khumarawayh's daughter to the new Caliph, but also the return of the provinces of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] and [[Diyar Mudar]] to caliphal control.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=105\u2013106}} Domestically, Khumarawayh's reign was one of \"luxury and decay\" ([[Hugh N. Kennedy]]), but also a time of relative tranquility in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period. Nevertheless, Khumarawayh's extravagant spending exhausted the fisc, and by the time of his assassination in 896, the Tulunid treasury was empty.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} Following Khumarawayh's death, internal strife sapped Tulunid power. Khumarawayh's son [[Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh]] was a drunkard who executed his uncle, Mudar ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun; he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]. Harun too was a weak ruler, and although a revolt by his uncle [[Rabi'ah ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Rabi'ah]] in Alexandria was suppressed, the Tulunids were unable to confront the attacks of the [[Qarmatians]] who began at the same time. In addition, many commanders defected to the Abbasids, whose power revived under the capable leadership of al-Muwaffaq's son, Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892\u2013902). Finally, in December 904, two other sons of Ibn Tulun, Ali and [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Shayban]], murdered their nephew and assumed control of the Tulunid state. Far from halting the decline, this event alienated key commanders in Syria and led to the rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of Syria and Egypt by the Abbasids under [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], who entered Fustat in January 905. With the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the victorious Abbasid troops pillaged al-Qata'i and razed it to the ground.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=106\u2013108}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=184\u2013185, 310}}\n\n===Second Abbasid period and Ikhshidid period===\nThe Abbasids were able to repulse [[Fatimid]] invasions of Egypt in [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (914\u2013915)|914\u2013915]] and [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|919\u2013921]]. \n\nIn 935, after repulsing another Fatimid attack, the Turkish commander [[Muhammad ibn Tughj]] became the ''de facto'' ruler of Egypt with the title of ''al-Ikhshid''.{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=112}} After his death in 946, the succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|invaded and conquered Egypt]], beginning a new era in the country's history.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=312\u2013313}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\n==Fatimid period==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\n{{main|Fatimid Caliphate}}\n[[Image:NE 1025ad.jpg|thumb|350px|The near East in 1025 AD, showing the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and neighbors.]]\n[[Jawhar as-Siqilli]] immediately began the building of a new city, [[Cairo]], to furnish quarters for the army which he had brought. A palace for the Caliph and a [[mosque]] for the army were immediately constructed, which for many centuries remained the centre of Muslim learning. However, the [[Carmathians]] of [[Damascus]] under [[Hasan al-Asam]] advanced through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Egypt, and in the autumn of 971 Jauhar found himself besieged in his new city. By a timely sortie, preceded by the administration of bribes to various officers in the Carmathian host, Jauhar succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat on the besiegers, who were compelled to evacuate Egypt and part of Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the caliph in 2 [[Ma'ad al-Muizz Li-Deenillah|al-Muizz]] had been summoned to enter the palace that had been prepared for him, and after leaving a viceroy to take charge of his western possessions he arrived in Alexandria on May 31 973, and proceeded to instruct his new subjects in the particular form of religion ([[Shiism]]) which his family represented. As this was in origin identical with that professed by the Carmathians, he hoped to gain the submission of their leader by argument; but this plan was unsuccessful, and there was a fresh invasion from that quarter in the year after his arrival, and the caliph found himself besieged in his capital.\n\nThe Carmathians were gradually forced to retreat from Egypt and then from Syria by some successful engagements, and by the judicious use of bribes, whereby dissension was sown among their leaders. Al-Muizz also found time to take some active measures against the Byzantines, with whom his generals fought in Syria with varying fortune. Before his death he was acknowledged as Caliph in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], as well as Syria, Egypt and [[North Africa]] as far as [[Tangier]].\n\nUnder the [[vizier]] [[Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah|al-Aziz]], there was a large amount of toleration conceded to the other sects of Islam, and to other communities, but the belief that the Christians of Egypt were in league with the [[Byzantine emperor]], and even burned a fleet which was being built for the Byzantine war, led to some persecution. Al-Aziz attempted without success to enter into friendly relations with the [[Buwayhid]] ruler of Baghdad, and tried to gain possession of [[Aleppo]], as the key to [[Iraq]], but this was prevented by the intervention of the Byzantines. His North African possessions were maintained and extended, but the recognition of the Fatimid caliph in this region was little more than nominal.\n\n[[File:Al-Azhar (inside) 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[Al-Azhar Mosque]], of medieval Fatimid [[Cairo]].]]\nHis successor [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] came to the throne at the age of eleven, being the son of Aziz by a Christian mother. His conduct of affairs was vigorous and successful, and he concluded a peace with the Byzantine emperor. He is perhaps best remembered by his destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] (1009), a measure which helped to provoke the [[Crusades]], but was only part of a general scheme for converting all Christians and [[Jew]]s in his dominions to his own opinions by force.\n\nA more reputable expedient with the same end in view was the construction of a great [[library]] in Cairo, with ample provision for students; this was modelled on a similar institution at Baghdad. His system of persecution was not abandoned till in the last year of his reign (1020) he thought fit to claim divinity,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} a doctrine which is perpetuated by the [[Druze]], called after one Darazi, who preached the divinity of al-Hakim at the time. For unknown reasons al-Hakim disappeared in 1021.\n\nIn 1049 the [[Zirid]] dynasty in the Maghrib returned to the [[Sunni]] faith and became subjects of the Caliphate in Baghdad, but at the same time [[Yemen]] recognized the Fatimid caliphate. Meanwhile, Baghdad was taken by the Turks, falling to the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Tughrul Beg]] in 1059. The Turks also plundered Cairo in 1068, but they were driven out by 1074. During this time, however, Syria was overrun by an invader in league with the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]], and Damascus was permanently lost to the Fatimids. This period is otherwise memorable for the rise of the [[Hashshashin]], or Assassins.\n\nDuring the [[Crusade]]s, al-Mustafa maintained himself in Alexandria, and helped the Crusaders by rescuing Jerusalem from the [[Ortokids]], thereby facilitating its conquest by the Crusaders in 1099. He endeavoured to retrieve his error by himself advancing into Palestine, but he was defeated at the [[battle of Ascalon]], and compelled to retire to Egypt. Many of the Palestinian possessions of the Fatimids then successively fell into the hands of the Crusaders.\n\nIn 1118 Egypt was invaded by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], who burned the gates and the mosques of Farama, and advanced to [[Tinnis]], when illness compelled him to retreat. In August 1121 [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] was assassinated in a street of Cairo, it is said, with the connivance of the Caliph, who immediately began the plunder of his house, where fabulous treasures were said to be amassed. The vizier's offices were given to al-Mamn. His external policy was not more fortunate than that of his predecessor, as he lost [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] to the Crusaders, and a fleet equipped by him was defeated by the [[Venice|Venetians]].\n\nIn 1153 [[Siege of Ascalon|Ascalon was lost]], the last place in Syria which the Fatimids held; its loss was attributed to dissensions between the parties of which the garrison consisted. In April 1154 the Caliph al-Zafir was murdered by his vizier Abbas, according to [[Usamah ibn Munqidh|Usamah]], because the Caliph had suggested to his favorite, the vizier's son, to murder his father; and this was followed by a massacre of the brothers of Zafir, followed by the raising of his infant son [[Al-Faiz|Abul-Qasim Isa]] to the throne.\n\nIn December 1162, the vizier [[Shawar]] took control of Cairo.  However, after only nine months he was compelled to flee to Damascus, where he was favorably received by the prince [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nureddin]], who sent with him to Cairo a force of [[Kurd]]s under Asad al-din [[Shirkuh]]. At the same time Egypt was [[Crusader invasion of Egypt|invaded by the Franks]], who raided and did much damage on the coast. Shawar recaptured Cairo but a dispute then arose with his Syrian allies for the possession of Egypt. Shawar, being unable to cope with the Syrians, demanded help of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]] [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]], who hastened to his aid with a large force, which united with Shawar's and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis for three months; at the end of this time, owing to the successes of Nureddin in Syria, the Franks granted Shirkuh a free passage with his troops back to Syria, on condition of Egypt being evacuated (October 1164).<ref>{{cite book|title=''The Crusades Through Arab Eyes''|author=Amin Maalouf|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crusadesthrougha00maal_0/page/159 159\u2013161]|year=1984|publisher=Al Saqi Books|isbn=0-8052-0898-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/crusadesthrougha00maal_0/page/159}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later [[Shirkuh]], a Kurdish general known as \"the Lion\", persuaded Nureddin to put him at the head of another expedition to Egypt, which left Syria in January 1167; a Frankish army hastened to Shawar's aid. At the battle of Babain (April 11, 1167) the allies were defeated by the forces commanded by Shirkuh and his nephew [[Saladin]], who was made prefect of Alexandria, which surrendered to Shirkuh without a struggle. In 1168 Amalric invaded again, but Shirkuh's return caused the Crusaders to withdraw.\n\nShirkuh was appointed vizier but died of indigestion (March 23, 1169), and the Caliph appointed Saladin as successor to Shirkuh; the new vizier professed to hold office as a deputy of Nureddin, whose name was mentioned in public worship after that of the Caliph. Nureddin loyally aided his deputy in dealing with Crusader invasions of Egypt, and he ordered Saladin to substitute the name of the Abbasid caliph for the Fatimid in public worship. The last Fatimid caliph died soon after in September, 1171.\n\n==Ayyubid period==<!-- This section is linked from [[Byzantine Empire]] -->\n{{main|Ayyubid dynasty}}\n[[Image:Ayyubid Dynasty 1171 - 1246(AD).PNG|thumb|350px|The [[Ayyubid Empire]] at its greatest extent]]\n\nSaladin, a general known as \"the Lion\", was confirmed as Nureddin's deputy in Egypt, and on the death of Nureddin on April 12, 1174 he took the title [[sultan]]. During his reign Damascus, rather than Cairo, was the major city of the empire. Nevertheless, he fortified Cairo, which became the political centre of Egypt. It was in 1183 that Saladin's rule over Egypt and North Syria was consolidated. Much of Saladin's time was spent in Syria, where he fought the [[Crusader States]], and Egypt was largely governed by his deputy [[Karaksh]].\n\nSaladin's son [[al-Aziz Uthman|Othman]] succeeded him in Egypt in 1193. He allied with his uncle (Saladin's brother) [[Al-Adil I]] against Saladin's other sons, and after the wars that followed, Al-Adil took power in 1200. He died in 1218 during the siege of [[Damietta]] in the [[Fifth Crusade]], and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]], who lost Damietta to the Crusaders in 1219. However, he defeated their advance to Cairo by flooding the Nile, and they were forced to evacuate Egypt in 1221. Al-Kamil was later forced to give up various cities in Palestina and Syria to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] during the [[Sixth Crusade]], in order to gain his help against Damascus.\n\n[[As-Salih Ayyub|Najm al-Din]] became sultan in 1240. His reign saw the recapture of Jerusalem in 1244, and the introduction of a larger force of [[Mameluks]] into the army. Much of his time was spent in campaigns in Syria, where he allied with the [[Khwarezmia]]ns against the Crusaders and Ayyubids. In 1249 he faced an invasion by [[Louis IX of France]] (the [[Seventh Crusade]]), and Damietta was lost again. Najm al-Din died soon after this, but his son [[Turanshah]] defeated Louis and expelled the Crusaders from Egypt. Turanshah was soon overthrown by the Mameluks, who had become the \"kingmakers\" since their arrival and now wanted full power for themselves.[[File:Exterior_of_Sultan_Ahmed_I_Mosque_in_Istanbul,_Turkey_002.jpg|thumb|'''Sultan Ahmed I Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey''']]\n\n==Mamluk Egypt==\n{{main|Mamluk Egypt}}\n\nThe Mamluk's violent approach to power brought them great political and economic prosperity and to becoming the rulers of Egypt.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Mamluks in Egyptian Politics and Society.|last=Hanna|first=Nelly|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr|others=Philipp, Thomas., Haarmann, Ulrich.|isbn=9780521033060|location=|pages=197|oclc=144525826}}</ref> The Mamluk Egypt period began with the Bahri Dynasty and be followed by the Burji Dynasty.

The first of these was [[Aybak]], who married [[Shajar al-Durr]] (the widow of [[al-Salih Ayyub]]) and quickly began a war with Syria. He was assassinated in 1257 and was succeeded by [[Qutuz]], who faced a growing danger from the [[Mongols]]\n\nQutuz defeated the army of [[Hulagu Khan]] at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260, allowing him to regain all of Syria except Crusader strongholds. On the way back to Egypt after the battle, Qutuz died and was succeeded by another commander, [[Baybars]], who assumed the Sultanate and ruled from 1260 to 1277. In 1291 [[al-Ashraf Khalil]] captured Acre, the last of the crusader cities.\n\nThe Bahris greatly enhanced the power and prestige of Egypt, building [[Cairo]] from a small town into one of the foremost cities in the world. Due to the sacking of [[Baghdad]] by the Mongols, Cairo became the central city of the [[Islamic world]]. The Mamluks built much of the earliest remaining architecture of Cairo, including many [[mosque]]s built out of stone using long, imposing lines.\n\nSince 1347 the [[Egyptians|Egyptian population]], economy, and political system experienced significant destruction as a result of the [[Black Death]]<nowiki/> pandemic whose waves continued to destroy Egypt up to the early 16th century.[[File:Mamluke.jpg|thumb]]In 1377 a revolt in Syria spread to Egypt, and the government was taken over by the [[Circassians]] Berekeh and [[Barkuk]].

Horkesley is a modern name for the original [[Old English language|Saxon]] name of \"Horkaslay\" which means \"farm land for herds\" (mainly sheep) though now it has many fields growing a variety of crops from [[Maize|corn]] to [[hemp]]. A few years ago an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] dig was made in woods on Coach Road, where a [[Bronze Age]] bronze smelting pit was found. Much Of Great Horkesley was a marsh, with very boggy ground, until it was drained by farmers. This is the reason why the main road is called \"The Causeway\" as it was a firm, and safe route of passage.\n\nDevelopment in the north of Colchester threatens to encroach on Great Horkesley. Housing targets set by the [[East of England Regional Assembly]] have led [[Colchester Borough Council]] to plan more than 2,200 new homes on the remaining green space between town and village along the A134 by 2021.\n\nThe Church of England has 2 churches in the parish.\n\nThere is a thriving Residents Association in the parish.\n\nGreat Horkesley Cricket Club was reformed in 1975 and played its home matches at The Chantry at the northern end of the village. Its origins can be traced back to at least 1861 when they were bowled out for 6 in the first innings against Layer Breton CC - home games then were played at Horkesley Park.

Horkesley is a modern name for the original [[Old English language|Saxon]] name of \"Horkaslay\" which means \"farm land for herds\" (mainly sheep) though now it has many fields growing a variety of crops from [[Maize|corn]] to [[hemp]]. A few years ago an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] dig was made in woods on Coach Road, where a [[Bronze Age]] bronze smelting pit was found. Much Of Great Horkesley was a marsh, with very boggy ground, until it was drained by farmers. This is the reason why the main road is called \"The Causeway\" as it was a firm, and safe route of passage.\n\nDevelopment in the north of Colchester threatens to encroach on Great Horkesley. Housing targets set by the [[East of England Regional Assembly]] have led [[Colchester Borough Council]] to plan more than 2,200 new homes on the remaining green space between town and village along the A134 by 2021.\n\nThe Church of England has 2 churches in the parish.\n\nThere is a thriving Residents Association in the parish.\n\nGreat Horkesley Cricket Club was reformed in 1975 and played its home matches at The Chantry at the northern end of the village. Its origins can be traced back to at least 1861 when they were bowled out for 6 in the first innings against Layer Breton CC - home games then were played at Horkesley Park. Due to uncertainty over development plans for the area, the club has temporarily moved its games to Mile End Playing Fields just a short distance from the village. In 2014, Great Horkesley Cricket Club and Lexden Cricket Club merged to form a new club called Great Horkesley & Lexden Cricket Club and will have two teams playing in Division Two and Five of the North Essex Cricket League. They will play first team games at Mile End, and second team games at Spring Lane, Lexden.\n\nThe village has good bus links into [[Colchester]], with services every 20 minutes.\n\n==Transport==\n{| class=\"wikitable vatop\"\n!
