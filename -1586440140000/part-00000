These 'battles' are performed using material items such as money, mobile phones, clothes, alcohol or foods. In most instances a battle is won by the intentional destruction or wastage of one's own expensive items to demonstrate the lack of concern for such material possessions due to the ability to afford more of the same. A competitor's chances of victory are improved by having items that are more expensive than those of their opponent it can be money or clothes. Some of the Izikhothanes are from [[Botswana]] (Super Mosha).\n\n== Origin ==\nThe word \"Izikhothane\" is a slang word that originates from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"Osikhotheni\". Osikhotheni means people who live in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word \"Isikhotha\" that means \"bush\". The singular form of this Zulu word is called \"usikhotheni\". This term is township slang for [[Con man|hustlers]] who live a lavish lifestyle (nice expensive clothes etc.) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish lifestyles.\n\nIzikhothane originated in the early 2000s in the South African townships of [[City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan]] previously known as the Eastrand, but mainly started in [[Katlehong]], one of the townships in Eastrand. The act remained largely unnoticed until it gained popularity in 2011 and 2012. A similar trend called uSwenka existed in South Africa in the 1950s where [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] and labourers dressed themselves in their finest suits and shoes to compete in contests.<ref name=mg1/> The winner of these contests would win money, household necessities or livestock, which they would send back home to their families.\n\n== Practices ==\nThe Izikhothane are usually from impoverished backgrounds and spend beyond their financial means to purchase high-end [[Designer clothing|designer apparel]], prestige branded alcohol, luxury food items, and expensive accessories including jewellery and mobile phones. These items are then destroyed or disposed of in an attempt to create a perception of opulence and thereby gain social status.\n\nIn [[Eastern Cape]] this culture is mostly joined at 11 to 18 years old. The purpose of the culture is to impress and making your [[clan]] famous. The members make battles of showing off tags and dancing with other groups to make themselves famous. In [[Port Elizabeth|P.E.]] the culture mostly includes music in it. The members end up dissing each others in terms of challenging. In Eastern Cape a Clan called Innocent Squad is the most famous and Skeem Seh Njabulo, in [[Jeffreys Bay]] is Smart Fellaz. Hankey got the elderly clan called Mpolo Trend. The members get money in different ways. Eastern cape got the mostly talented clans for example Innocent Squad (also known as Obhuti abamsulwa) is one of the clan with its own recording studio (Omthina fam). As the Producer and the member of the clan meets Young Talents Int, he said \"I am very glad to be in my clan. My wish is us to be the example of our fellow clans. Grow and glow.Be wise,stop wasting and save for the future\" said Blessing Brighter mostly known as Jostar. In other ways community don't support this culture but it never stopped. In Eastern Cape, Carvela is mostly worn in terms of showing you afford. They always show themselves in Public places for attention and makes Saturday a big day for them.\n\nThe ability to afford expensive clothing is fundamental to Izikhothane and one's reputation is determined by this expression. The Izikhothane sometimes demonstrate this by buying two pairs of the same high-end brand of shoe in different colours and then wearing one shoe of each colour to indicate that two pairs of the same expensive shoe can be afforded.<ref name=star1/> Another tactic in battle is to wear expensive clothing in layers and then destroy one layer at a time thereby destroying more clothes than the opponent. Price tags are sometimes retained on the clothing so that competitors can flaunt the cost of their items.\n\nSome of the greatest legends are Thapelo Sello (Sisto Di Boto), King Mosha, Cvk, Don Dada, Fearless Mosha,Mandana,Mavesta. etc.\n\n== Battles ==\nThe aim of the dance battle is to show more abundance than your opponents as this determines the winner of the battle. There is no tangible reward for winning an Izikhothane battle, just the recognition and affection from the audience that witnesses the battle.\n\nIzikhothane battles occur predominantly across South Africa's townships. The act or battle is performed in a public place such as a park or any open space so that large crowds may gather to witness the event.\n\nCompetitors are predominantly males aged between 12 and 25 years. The popularity of Izikhothane has also started to attract female youth (Material.Mix and Material.Prix). Izikhothane groups compete against each other in inter- or intra-township battles. A group's identity and reputation is upheld by its members' wasteful extravagance.\n\nTo perform in an Izikhothane battle, a contestant must purchase expensive items such as clothing, shoes, alcohol and exorbitant accessories. Loud, colourful, branded items are a necessity. The more a competitor's gear costs, the more dominant they are able to be in the battle. Once at the battle venue, the contestant calls out an opponent. Thereafter these two competitors dance around, showing off their expensive material items to each other and to the crowd. To win the battle, a contestant may be required to destroy their items such as tearing up cash notes, burning or tearing up their designer branded clothing, pouring out expensive alcohol onto the ground and Custured or submerging their mobile phones in water.<ref name=star1/> The champions are decided by the crowd whereby the crowd cheers for the Izikhothane that impressed them the most with their abundance of wealth as depicted by the destruction of their high-value items.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Competitive altruism]]\n* [[Koha (custom)|Koha]], a similar concept among the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]\n* [[Moka exchange]], a similar concept in [[Papua New Guinea]]\n* [[Potlatch]]\n* [[Potluck]]\n* [[Pow wow]], a gathering whose name is derived from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] word for \"spiritual leader\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=mg1>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/print/2011-10-28-burn-after-wearing-township-kids-hottest-fashion-statement/|title=Burn after wearing \u2013 township kids' hottest fashion statement|author=Nkosi, Sibongile|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=Mail & Guardian|publisher=M&G Online}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=star1>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-bling-1.1343682/|title=Burning Bling|author=Unknown|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-with-a-destructive-desire-1.1465938/|title=Burning with a destructive desire|author=Wende, Hamilton|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403/|title=Youths destroy pricey togs in show-off challenges|author=Ndabeni, Khanyi|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Herald|publisher=Times Media Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204021635/http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403|archive-date=4 December 2013|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|title=Brash bling and ghetto fabulous|author=Unknown|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024064533/http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|title='Izikhothane' tear up R100 notes \u2013 report|author=Unknown|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106081319/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|archive-date=6 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{facebook.com|izikhothane|Izikothane (official)}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEcV_Ecfl4 Izikothane on 3rd Degree \u2013 Part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsnhbRM7P4 Part 2], and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O97BOeLVI5o Part 3]\u2014YouTube videos of current affairs investigative journalism on eNCA news channel\n\n[[Category:South African culture]]\n[[Category:South African English]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|South African competition to determine which party is wealthier.}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Izikhothane''' (Ukukhothana) refers to [[South Africa]]n [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] or dance battles in which individuals or groups of individuals compete against each other in front of large crowds to determine which party is wealthier.

The Izikhothane sometimes demonstrate this by buying two pairs of the same high-end brand of shoe in different colours and then wearing one shoe of each colour to indicate that two pairs of the same expensive shoe can be afforded.<ref name=star1/> Another tactic in battle is to wear expensive clothing in layers and then destroy one layer at a time thereby destroying more clothes than the opponent. Price tags are sometimes retained on the clothing so that competitors can flaunt the cost of their items.\n\nSome of the greatest legends are Thapelo Sello (Sisto Di Boto), King Mosha, Cvk, Don Dada, Fearless Mosha,Mandana,Mavesta. etc.\n\n== Battles ==\nThe aim of the dance battle is to show more abundance than your opponents as this determines the winner of the battle. There is no tangible reward for winning an Izikhothane battle, just the recognition and affection from the audience that witnesses the battle.\n\nIzikhothane battles occur predominantly across South Africa's townships. The act or battle is performed in a public place such as a park or any open space so that large crowds may gather to witness the event.\n\nCompetitors are predominantly males aged between 12 and 25 years. The popularity of Izikhothane has also started to attract female youth {Material.Mix and Material.Prix). Izikhothane groups compete against each other in inter- or intra-township battles. A group's identity and reputation is upheld by its members' wasteful extravagance.\n\nTo perform in an Izikhothane battle, a contestant must purchase expensive items such as clothing, shoes, alcohol and exorbitant accessories. Loud, colourful, branded items are a necessity. The more a competitor's gear costs, the more dominant they are able to be in the battle. Once at the battle venue, the contestant calls out an opponent. Thereafter these two competitors dance around, showing off their expensive material items to each other and to the crowd. To win the battle, a contestant may be required to destroy their items such as tearing up cash notes, burning or tearing up their designer branded clothing, pouring out expensive alcohol onto the ground and Custured or submerging their mobile phones in water.<ref name=star1/> The champions are decided by the crowd whereby the crowd cheers for the Izikhothane that impressed them the most with their abundance of wealth as depicted by the destruction of their high-value items.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Competitive altruism]]\n* [[Koha (custom)|Koha]], a similar concept among the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]\n* [[Moka exchange]], a similar concept in [[Papua New Guinea]]\n* [[Potlatch]]\n* [[Potluck]]\n* [[Pow wow]], a gathering whose name is derived from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] word for \"spiritual leader\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=mg1>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/print/2011-10-28-burn-after-wearing-township-kids-hottest-fashion-statement/|title=Burn after wearing \u2013 township kids' hottest fashion statement|author=Nkosi, Sibongile|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=Mail & Guardian|publisher=M&G Online}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=star1>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-bling-1.1343682/|title=Burning Bling|author=Unknown|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-with-a-destructive-desire-1.1465938/|title=Burning with a destructive desire|author=Wende, Hamilton|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403/|title=Youths destroy pricey togs in show-off challenges|author=Ndabeni, Khanyi|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Herald|publisher=Times Media Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204021635/http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403|archive-date=4 December 2013|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|title=Brash bling and ghetto fabulous|author=Unknown|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024064533/http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|title='Izikhothane' tear up R100 notes \u2013 report|author=Unknown|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106081319/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|archive-date=6 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{facebook.com|izikhothane|Izikothane (official)}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEcV_Ecfl4 Izikothane on 3rd Degree \u2013 Part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsnhbRM7P4 Part 2], and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O97BOeLVI5o Part 3]\u2014YouTube videos of current affairs investigative journalism on eNCA news channel\n\n[[Category:South African culture]]\n[[Category:South African English]]\n", "name_user": "MichaelEspersen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBattles:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izikhothane"}

Punk was massive then and we felt that our time had come and gone.\"\n\nTo make matters worse for the band, manager [[Don Arden]] began spending more of his time focusing on another of his acts, [[Electric Light Orchestra]], whose 1975 album ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]'' was their first to make the US top ten. Iommi's determination to move Sabbath in a new direction was misguided according to some, with Mick Wall noting in the 2013 book ''Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe'' that while future [[soft rock]] million-sellers ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' and ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' were just around the corner, \"to try and force that sound on Black Sabbath was like trying to put lamb's wool on a suit of armour. It just didn't work, pleasing nobody.\"\n\nIn his autobiography ''I Am Ozzy'', vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]] admitted he had begun to consider leaving the band during this time: \"I'd even had a T-shirt made with 'Blizzard of Ozz' written on the front. Meanwhile, in the studio, Tony (Iommi) was always saying, 'We've gotta sound like [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]', or 'We've gotta sound like [[Queen (band)|Queen]].'

The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, and performed an early version of what would become \"Junior's Eyes\" on the [[BBC]] programme ''Look Hear'' with him.\n\nWhile the band were recording the album, [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]] were recording ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' in an adjacent studio at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami. \"Before we could start recording we had to scrape all the cocaine out of the mixing board,\" Geezer divulged to ''Uncut'' in 2014. \"I think they'd left about a pound of cocaine in the board.\" The Eagles were forced to stop recording on numerous occasions because Sabbath were too loud and the sound was coming through the wall.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\">{{cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |url=https://archive.org/details/ironmanmyjourney00iomm_0 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-30681-9551}}</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\nThe [[cover art]] was designed by [[Hipgnosis]].

From the title of the piece, ''Technical Ecstasy'', I thought of something ecstatic rather than something technical, and I immediately thought of ecstasy in sexual terms: some sort of mechanical copulation, which would be tricky to do. I then thought of ecstasy as falling in love, perhaps during a brief encounter on an escalator \u2013 and, since it was 'technical', I thought of two robots&nbsp;... It's really quite simple \u2013 he's just done curves for the female and hard, angular, macho lines for the male. It's really quite sexist, actually \u2013 stereotyped. Anyway, it's love at first sight, but I felt robots wouldn't do it like humans would do it, so instead they're squirting lubricating fluid at one another.\" The UK release had a two-sided insert of lyrics and credits.\n\n==Composition and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2004|label=\"Black Sabbath: ''Technical Ecstasy''\" |first=Greg |last=Prato |accessdate={{date|2011-09-13}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |title=Black Sabbath: Album Guide |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427215415/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |archive-date=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n''Technical Ecstasy'''s lyrics dealt with a variety of topics. Tony Iommi's autobiography ''Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath'' reveals that \"Dirty Women\" was about \"all these hookers\" Butler had seen around [[Florida]]. \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" is about \"a transvestite who becomes [[President of the United States]],\" Butler told biographer Mick Wall in 2013, \"because America was such a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] society at the time.\" The music itself was seldom dark, as the band continued experimenting with keyboards and synthesizers, especially on the orchestrated ballad \"She's Gone\".\n\nThe album received mixed reviews, with Phil Alexander writing in 1998, \"While today hardcore Sabs fans defend some of the bold steps taken on ''Technical Ecstasy'', it was a confused offering which still hit Number 13 in the UK but limped into the US charts at 52.\" In 2001, ''[[Guitar World]]'' was less kind, calling it perhaps the \"least-loved effort of the original lineup\" with the band \"trying to stretch its sound in several different directions, none of them exceptionally successful.\" It deemed \"Rock 'N' Roll Doctor\" \"a bad [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] imitation\" while eschewing \"It's Alright\" as \"a sub-par [[Paul McCartney]]-style pop ballad.\" In 2013 ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine opined, \"''Technical Ecstasy'' is the sound of Sabbath trying to make a grown-up, radio-friendly rock record and, in some parts, it works&nbsp;... Mostly, however, it doesn't with tracks like 'Back Street Kids', 'Rock 'N' Roll Doctor' and 'Dirty Women' resorting to clich\u00e9d and ill-fitting rock moves.\" Greg Prato of ''[[AllMusic]]'' agrees \"it was not on par with Sabbath's exceptional first five releases,\" but praises \"Dirty Women\", the \"funky\" \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" and the \"raging opener\" \"Back Street Kids\".\n\nThe ballad \"It's Alright\" was written and sung by drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]]. Initially reluctant to sing the song for fear of offending Osbourne, he was encouraged by the band to do it.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> In his autobiography, Osbourne praises the performance, enthusing, \"He's got a great voice, Bill, and I was more than happy for him to do the honours.\" It was released as a single because, said Iommi, \"We want to break out as far as we can\u2026 so we've decided to hit the singles market.\"<ref name=\"Barackman\"/> It has since been covered live by [[Guns N' Roses]], and was included on their ''[[Live Era '87\u2013'93]]'' album. It was also featured in the 2010 film ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story (film)|It's Kind of a Funny Story]]''.\n\nIn 1992, Iommi admitted to ''Guitar World'': \"Black Sabbath fans generally don't like much of ''Technical Ecstasy''. It was really a no-win situation for us. If we had stayed the same, people would have said we were still doing the same old stuff. So we tried to get a little more technical, and it just didn\u2019t work out very well.\"\n\nDuring the subsequent 1977 European tour in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'', the band was supported by [[AC/DC]].<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> The relationship between bassist [[Geezer Butler]] and [[AC/DC]] guitarist [[Malcolm Young]] was quite tense.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] recalls the atmosphere between the two being \"heavy\" and that the pair did not get along at all.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Ward's drum tech Graham Wright and Osbourne's personal assistant David Tangye stated in their 2004 book ''How Black Was Our Sabbath'' that the problems between the two originated after a show the two bands performed earlier in [[Switzerland]].<ref name=\"howblack\">{{cite book |last1=Tangye |first1=Dave |last2=Wright |first2=Graham |title=How Black Was Our Sabbath |year=2004 |publisher=PAN Macmillan Adult |isbn=978-0-33041-1943 |page=193}}</ref> An altercation occurred in an hotel bar in which Butler removed a switch-blade comb from his pocket and opened it. Young thought it was a [[Switchblade|switchblade knife]] and believed Butler was pointing it at him.<ref name=\"howblack\" /> In the [[Bon Scott]] biography ''Highway To Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott'', Clinton Walker writes of the tour: \"Sabbath, by 1976, were well past their prime, and AC/DC were all but blowing them right off the stage. Substance abuse in the band was rampant.\" Graham and Tangye also disclose that during the tour drummer Ward had begun driving from gig to gig in a rented [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] due to a fear of flying.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side one\n| all_writing = Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne, except \"It's Alright\", written by Bill Ward\n| title1  = Back Street Kids\n| length1 = 3:47\n| title2  = You Won't Change Me\n| length2 = 6:42\n| title3  = It's Alright\n| length3 = 4:04\n| title4  = Gypsy\n| length4 = 5:14\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title5  = All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\n| length5 = 5:07\n| title6  = Rock 'n' Roll Doctor\n| length6 = 3:30\n| title7  = She's Gone\n| length7 = 4:58\n| title8  = Dirty Women\n| length8 = 7:13\n}}\n\n* The cassette version reverses the two sides.\n* Tracks 3 and 4 were swapped on some copies.\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Black Sabbath'''\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] \u2013 lead vocals\n* [[Tony Iommi]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Geezer Butler]] \u2013 bass guitar\n* [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] \u2013 drums, lead vocals on \"It's Alright\"\n'''Additional'''\n* [[Gerald Woodroffe|Gerald \"Jezz\" Woodroffe]] \u2013 keyboards (credited as \"Gerald Woodruffe\")\n\n==Release history==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, and performed an early version of what would become \"Junior's Eyes\" on the [[BBC]] programme ''Look Hear'' with him.\n\nWhile the band were recording the album, [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]] were recording ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' in an adjacent studio at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami. \"Before we could start recording we had to scrape all the cocaine out of the mixing board,\" Geezer divulged to ''Uncut'' in 2014. \"I think they'd left about a pound of cocaine in the board.\" The Eagles were forced to stop recording on numerous occasions because Sabbath were too loud and the sound was coming through the wall.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\">{{cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |url=https://archive.org/details/ironmanmyjourney00iomm_0 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-30681-9551}}</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\nThe [[cover art]] was designed by [[Hipgnosis]].

From the title of the piece, ''Technical Ecstasy'', I thought of something ecstatic rather than something technical, and I immediately thought of ecstasy in sexual terms: some sort of mechanical copulation, which would be tricky to do.

It's really quite simple \u2013 he's just done curves for the female and hard, angular, macho lines for the male. It's really quite sexist, actually \u2013 stereotyped. Anyway, it's love at first sight, but I felt robots wouldn't do it like humans would do it, so instead they're squirting lubricating fluid at one another.\" The UK release had a two-sided insert of lyrics and credits.\n\n==Composition and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2004|label=\"Black Sabbath: ''Technical Ecstasy''\" |first=Greg |last=Prato |accessdate={{date|2011-09-13}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |title=Black Sabbath: Album Guide |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427215415/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/black-sabbath/albumguide |archive-date=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n''Technical Ecstasy'''s lyrics dealt with a variety of topics. Tony Iommi's autobiography ''Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath'' reveals that \"Dirty Women\" was about \"all these hookers\" Butler had seen around [[Florida]]. \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" is about \"a transvestite who becomes [[President of the United States]],\" Butler told biographer Mick Wall in 2013, \"because America was such a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] society at the time.\" The music itself was seldom dark, as the band continued experimenting with keyboards and synthesizers, especially on the orchestrated ballad \"She's Gone\".\n\nThe album received mixed reviews, with Phil Alexander writing in 1998, \"While today hardcore Sabs fans defend some of the bold steps taken on ''Technical Ecstasy'', it was a confused offering which still hit Number 13 in the UK but limped into the US charts at 52.\" In 2001, ''[[Guitar World]]'' was less kind, calling it perhaps the \"least-loved effort of the original lineup\" with the band \"trying to stretch its sound in several different directions, none of them exceptionally successful.\" It deemed \"Rock 'N' Roll Doctor\" \"a bad [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] imitation\" while eschewing \"It's Alright\" as \"a sub-par [[Paul McCartney]]-style pop ballad.\" In 2013 ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine opined, \"''Technical Ecstasy'' is the sound of Sabbath trying to make a grown-up, radio-friendly rock record and, in some parts, it works&nbsp;... Mostly, however, it doesn't with tracks like 'Back Street Kids', 'Rock 'N' Roll Doctor' and 'Dirty Women' resorting to clich\u00e9d and ill-fitting rock moves.\" Greg Prato of ''[[AllMusic]]'' agrees \"it was not on par with Sabbath's exceptional first five releases,\" but praises \"Dirty Women\", the \"funky\" \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" and the \"raging opener\" \"Back Street Kids\".\n\nThe ballad \"It's Alright\" was written and sung by drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]]. Initially reluctant to sing the song for fear of offending Osbourne, he was encouraged by the band to do it.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> In his autobiography, Osbourne praises the performance, enthusing, \"He's got a great voice, Bill, and I was more than happy for him to do the honours.\" It was released as a single because, said Iommi, \"We want to break out as far as we can\u2026 so we've decided to hit the singles market.\"<ref name=\"Barackman\"/> It has since been covered live by [[Guns N' Roses]], and was included on their ''[[Live Era '87\u2013'93]]'' album. It was also featured in the 2010 film ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story (film)|It's Kind of a Funny Story]]''.\n\nIn 1992, Iommi admitted to ''Guitar World'': \"Black Sabbath fans generally don't like much of ''Technical Ecstasy''. It was really a no-win situation for us. If we had stayed the same, people would have said we were still doing the same old stuff. So we tried to get a little more technical, and it just didn\u2019t work out very well.\"\n\nDuring the subsequent 1977 European tour in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'', the band was supported by [[AC/DC]].<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> The relationship between bassist [[Geezer Butler]] and [[AC/DC]] guitarist [[Malcolm Young]] was quite tense.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] recalls the atmosphere between the two being \"heavy\" and that the pair did not get along at all.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Ward's drum tech Graham Wright and Osbourne's personal assistant David Tangye stated in their 2004 book ''How Black Was Our Sabbath'' that the problems between the two originated after a show the two bands performed earlier in [[Switzerland]].<ref name=\"howblack\">{{cite book |last1=Tangye |first1=Dave |last2=Wright |first2=Graham |title=How Black Was Our Sabbath |year=2004 |publisher=PAN Macmillan Adult |isbn=978-0-33041-1943 |page=193}}</ref> An altercation occurred in an hotel bar in which Butler removed a switch-blade comb from his pocket and opened it. Young thought it was a [[Switchblade|switchblade knife]] and believed Butler was pointing it at him.<ref name=\"howblack\" /> In the [[Bon Scott]] biography ''Highway To Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott'', Clinton Walker writes of the tour: \"Sabbath, by 1976, were well past their prime, and AC/DC were all but blowing them right off the stage. Substance abuse in the band was rampant.\" Graham and Tangye also disclose that during the tour drummer Ward had begun driving from gig to gig in a rented [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] due to a fear of flying.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side one\n| all_writing = Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne, except \"It's Alright\", written by Bill Ward\n| title1  = Back Street Kids\n| length1 = 3:47\n| title2  = You Won't Change Me\n| length2 = 6:42\n| title3  = It's Alright\n| length3 = 4:04\n| title4  = Gypsy\n| length4 = 5:14\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title5  = All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\n| length5 = 5:07\n| title6  = Rock 'n' Roll Doctor\n| length6 = 3:30\n| title7  = She's Gone\n| length7 = 4:58\n| title8  = Dirty Women\n| length8 = 7:13\n}}\n\n* The cassette version reverses the two sides.\n* Tracks 3 and 4 were swapped on some copies.\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Black Sabbath'''\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] \u2013 lead vocals\n* [[Tony Iommi]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Geezer Butler]] \u2013 bass guitar\n* [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] \u2013 drums, lead vocals on \"It's Alright\"\n'''Additional'''\n* [[Gerald Woodroffe|Gerald \"Jezz\" Woodroffe]] \u2013 keyboards (credited as \"Gerald Woodruffe\")\n\n==Release history==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
