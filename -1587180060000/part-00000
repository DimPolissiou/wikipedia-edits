FCD 1 also serves as guidance to state, local, and tribal governments.\n\nThe Federal Continuity Directive 2 (FCD 2) of June 2017 is a directive to assist federal Executive Branch organizations in identifying their Mission Essential Functions (MEFs) and candidate Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).<ref>Federal Continuity Directives and Continuity of Operations documents collection https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/86284.</ref>\n\nThe DHS together with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), and in coordination with other non-federal partners in July 2013, developed the Continuity Guidance Circular 1 (CGC 1) and CGC 2.\n\nThe preamble of the CGC 1 states that its function is to provide \"direction to the non-Federal Governments (NFGs) for developing continuity plans and programs. Continuity planning facilitates the performance of essential functions during all-hazards emergencies or other situations that may disrupt normal operations. By continuing the performance of essential functions through a catastrophic emergency, the State, territorial, tribal, and local governments, and the private sector support the ability of the Federal Government to perform National Essential Functions (NEFs).\"\n\nCGC 1 parallels the information in FCD 1 closely, but is geared to states, territories, tribal and local governments, and private-sector organizations.\n\nThe purpose of Continuity Guidance Circular 2 (CGC 2) is to provide \"non-Federal Governments (NFGs) with guidance on how to implement CGC 1, Annex D: ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. It provides them with guidance, a methodology, and checklists to identify, assess, and validate their essential functions.

It is also possible that the president would authorize the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or others to use it, depending on the circumstances.\n*[[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] is [[United States Strategic Command]]'s Airborne Command Post, designed to take over in case [[NORAD|North American Aerospace Defense Command]]'s Cheyenne Mountain Directorate is destroyed or incapable of communicating with strategic forces.  Beginning February 3, 1961, an Air Force Looking Glass aircraft was in the air at all times 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  On July 24, 1990, Looking Glass ceased continuous airborne alert but remained on ground or airborne alert 24 hours a day.  On October 1, 1998, the U.S. Navy replaced the U.S. Air Force.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}  In addition, a battle staff now flies with the [[TACAMO]] crew.<ref>[http://www.tacamo.navy.mil/wing/index.asp TACAMO - Take Charge And Move Out]</ref>\n\n===Ships===\n[[File:USS Wright (CC-2) underway at sea on 25 September 1963 (KN-5885).jpg|thumb|The USS Wright (CC-2)]]\n\nTwo [[National Emergency Command Post Afloat|National Emergency Command Posts Afloat]] were:\n*{{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|6}} was converted into Command Ship CC-1 about 1962.\n*{{USS|Wright|CVL-49|6}} was converted into Command Ship CC-2 between 1962 and 1963 and included the National Military Command System.\n\nThese vessels were decommissioned in 1970.\n\n===Communication===\nThe Defense Communication Agency was tasked in 1963 with maintaining an active backup of all communications for any event that could disrupt communications and the management of command and control communications systems as the National Communications System. This mission was partially transferred to [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] in charge of supporting command, control, communications, and information systems for the military in the 1990s and would support the [[National Command Authority]]. These functions were later transferred to Joint Forces Command and STRATCOM but the backup contingency systems continue to operate. It is assumed that the various bunkers and airplanes have been equipped with special communication equipment to survive a catastrophe.\n{{See also|National Program Office}}\n\n*[[Internet]] - The Internet began as the [[ARPANET]], a program funded by the U.S. military.  The Internet is designed with the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks, but was never designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Due to the huge numbers of people using it, it would likely be jammed and unable to handle communication if it suffered a large amount of damage.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  During a localized emergency, it is highly useful. However, the loss of electrical power to an area can make accessing the Internet difficult or impossible.\n*[[Communications satellite]]s - Basically immune to any ground catastrophe, it is expected that military communication satellites would provide the government with the ability to communicate in any situation other than one that includes a direct attack upon the satellites.\n*{{ref|https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070509-12.html Homeland security takes over communications May 9, 2007}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Business continuity]]\n*[[Critical infrastructure protection]]\n*[[Designated survivor]]\n*[[Disaster recovery]]\n*[[Main Core]]\n*[[National Response Framework]]\n*[[National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive]]\n*[[Presidential directive]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[https://drii.org/ \"Disaster Recovery Institute International\"]\n*[https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/86284 \"Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD 1) 2012\"] - Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD 1) 2012, a PDF download of the Directive.\n*[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd/pdd-67.htm \"Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations\"] - Description of the secret Presidential Decision Directive 67, October 21, 1998\n*[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd/fpc-65.htm \"Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations (COOP)\"] - Federal Preparedness Circular 65, July 26, 1999\n*[[s:Transwiki:Federal Preparedness Circular 65|FEDERAL PREPAREDNESS CIRCULAR 65, June 15, 2004]] (from  [http://www.fema.gov/txt/government/coop/fpc65_0604.txt FEMA site])\n*[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070509-12.html National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive] Subject: National Continuity Policy May 9, 2007 - Revocation.

Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign each for members [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]], [[Kofi Kingston]], and [[Xavier Woods]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy.

[[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

[[world tag team championship]] contested in [[WWE]] on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign each for members [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]], [[Kofi Kingston]], and [[Xavier Woods]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].
