The Addams Family originally included [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Morticia Addams]], their children [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]], close family members [[Uncle Fester]]{{efn|name=Character1}} and [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]],{{efn|name=Character2|Just like Fester, there are canonical differences between the various incarnations of Grandmamma Addams. In the two live-action feature films, both animated series, and the 1998 television film, she is portrayed Morticia's mother. In his notes for the original cartoons, Charles Addams even refers to her as Grandma Frump, rendering her Wednesday's and Pugsley's maternal grandmother.\n<ref name=evilution/>{{rp|2}} In the 1964 television series and the 2019 animated film, however, she is portrayed as Gomez's mother.}} their butler [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], and Pugsley's pet octopus Aristotle. The dimly seen [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]] (later a disembodied hand) was introduced in 1954, and Gomez's [[Cousin Itt]] and Morticia's pet lion, Kitty Kat in 1964.{{efn|name=Character3}}\n\nThe Addamses are a [[satire|satirical]] inversion of the ideal [[History of the United States (1918\u201345)|20th-century American]] family: an odd wealthy [[American gentry|aristocratic]] clan who delight in the [[macabre]] and are seemingly unaware or unconcerned that other people find them bizarre or frightening. They originally appeared as an unrelated group of 150 single-panel cartoons, about half of which were originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' between their debut in 1938 and Charles Addams' death in 1988. They have since been adapted to other media. In 1964, a [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|live-action television series]], starring [[John Astin]] and [[Carolyn Jones]], premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and subsequently inspired a [[Halloween with the New Addams Family|1977 television film]] and cameos from the cast [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies|in other shows]]. An unrelated [[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|animated series]] aired in 1973. The franchise was revived in the 1990s with a feature film series consisting of ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (1991) and ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (1993). Both received nominations for [[Academy Award]]s, [[BAFTA Award]]s, and [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Awards]]. For her role as Morticia, [[Anjelica Huston]] was twice nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]], and [[Raul Julia]] (as Gomez), [[Christina Ricci]] (as Wednesday), [[Christopher Lloyd]] (as Fester), and [[Joan Cusack]] (as Fester's wife, Debbie Jellinsky, in the sequel) received multiple [[Saturn Award]] and [[American Comedy Award]] nominations for their portrayals.  The films inspired a [[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|second animated series]] (1992\u20131993) which is set in the same fictional universe but with Astin reprising his role as the voice of Gomez. It was nominated for four [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], including one for Astin. Following Julia's death, the series was rebooted with a [[Addams Family Reunion|1998 direct-to-video film]] starring [[Tim Curry]] and [[Daryl Hannah]], and a [[The New Addams Family|spin-off live-action television series]] (1998\u20131999). A decade later, a [[The Addams Family (musical)|live musical adaptation]] featuring [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]] opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was nominated for two [[Tony Award]]s and eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s. The franchise has become a staple of [[The Addams Family#Homages and adaptations|popular culture]] and it has also spawned [[The Addams Family (video game series)|a video game series]], [[The Addams Family: An Evilution|academic books]], and soundtracks which are based around its [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording \u2013 Special or Novel Effects|Grammy]]-nominated [[The Addams Family Theme|theme song]].\n\nThe family has had a profound influence on [[American comic book|American comics]], [[Cinema of the United States|cinema]] and [[Television in the United States|television]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Stephen|title=The Addams Family: Volume One|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-addams-family-volume-one/|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=[[Pop Matters]]|date=December 3, 2016|quote=''The Addams Family'' [...] left an indelible mark on pop culture [...] was an obvious influence on future pop culture icons [...] gained a loyal cult following, and [...] influenced the work of future ghoulmeisters like [[Tim Burton]].}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Mankoff, Bob|title=Charles Addams|url=http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/charles-addams|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=March 11, 2010|quote=I think [Charles Addams'] influence is, like the man, largish.

They are a close-knit [[extended family]]. Morticia is an exemplary mother, and she and Gomez remain passionate towards each other; as established in the television series, she calls him [[Yiddish words used in English#B|\"bubbeleh\"]],<ref>[[Austro-Bavarian]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: Lit. \"little boy\"</ref> to which he responds by kissing her arms, behavior which Morticia can also provoke by speaking a few words in [[French language|French]] (their meanings are not important; any words in French will do). The parents are supportive of their children. The family is friendly and hospitable to visitors, in some cases it is willing to donate large sums of money to causes (television series and films), despite the visitors' horror at the Addamses' peculiar lifestyle.\n\nCharles Addams began as a cartoonist in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932.<ref name=maslin/> His cartoons ran regularly in the magazine from 1938, when he drew the first instance of what came to be called The Addams Family, until his death in 1988.<ref name=maslin>{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/books/26masl.html |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=In Search of the Dark Muse of a Master of the Macabre |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=October 26, 2006 |page=E9 |accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Addams met [[science fiction]] writer [[Ray Bradbury]] after drawing an illustration for Bradbury's short story \"Homecoming\" in ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine, the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois monsters, the Elliotts. Bradbury and Addams became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history, with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations; but it never materialized. Bradbury's Elliott Family stories were anthologized in ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'' (2001), with a connecting narrative, an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams's 1946 ''Mademoiselle'' illustration used for the book's cover jacket. Although Addams's own characters were well established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury states that Addams \"went his way and created the Addams Family and I went my own way and created my family in this book.\"<ref>{{cite web | first=Gavin J. | last=Grant | url=http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray | title=Ray Bradbury Interview Part 1 | publisher=[[IndieBound#IndieBound.org|IndieBound]] | year=2000 | accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Television===\n{{Series overview\n|auxA1=[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1964)]]\n|auxA3=[[The Addams Family (1973 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1973)]]\n|auxA4=[[The Addams Family (1992 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1992)]]\n|auxA6=''[[The New Addams Family]]''\n|auxA=Series\n|caption=Overview for ''The Addams Family'' TV series and specials\n|color1=000000\n|color2=4a4a4a\n|color2S=000070\n|color3=345F5F\n|color3S=00f\n|color4=000\n|color5=84ab14\n|color6=000\n|end1={{End date|1965|5|21}}\n|end2={{End date|1966|4|8}}\n|end3={{End date|1973|12|22}}\n|end4={{End date|1992|12|5}}\n|end5={{End date|1993|11|6}}\n|end6={{End date|1999|8|28}}\n|episodes1=34\n|episodes2=30\n|episodes3=16\n|episodes4=13\n|episodes5=8\n|episodes6=65\n|link1=List of The Addams Family episodes#Season 1 (1964\u201365)\n|link2=List of The Addams Family episodes#Season 2 (1965\u201366)\n|link2S=List of The New Scooby-Doo Movies episodes#ep3\n|link3=The Addams Family (1973 TV series)#Episodes\n|link3S=Halloween with the New Addams Family\n|link4=The Addams Family (1992 TV series)#Season 1 (1992)\n|link5=The Addams Family (1992 TV series)#Season 2 (1993)\n|link6=The New Addams Family#Episodes\n|linkT2S=''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' crossover\n|linkT3S=Halloween special\n|network1=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|network2S=[[CBS]]\n|network3=[[NBC]]\n|network4=ABC\n|network6=[[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] <small>(Canada)</small><br>[[History of Freeform (TV channel)#Fox Family|Fox Family Channel]] <small>(United States)</small>\n|start1={{Start date|1964|9|18}}\n|start2={{Start date|1965|9|17}}\n|start2S={{Start date|1972|9|23}}\n|start3={{Start date|1973|9|8}}\n|start3S={{Start date|1977|10|30}}\n|start4={{Start date|1992|9|12}}\n|start5={{Start date|1993|9|18}}\n|start6={{Start date|1998|10|19}}\n}}\n====''The Addams Family'' (1964\u20131966)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1964 TV series)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nIn 1964, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC TV]] network created [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' television series]] based on Addams's cartoon characters. The series was shot in [[black-and-white]] and aired for two seasons in 64 half-hour episodes (September 18, 1964 \u2013 September 2, 1966). During the original television run of ''The Addams Family'' television series, ''The New Yorker'' editor [[William Shawn]] refused to publish any ''Addams Family'' cartoons, though he continued to publish other Charles Addams cartoons. Shawn regarded his magazine as targeting a more refined readership and he did not want it to be associated with characters who could be seen on television by just anybody. After Shawn's 1987 retirement, the characters were welcomed back to ''The New Yorker''.\n\n====''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' (1972)====\nThe Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\" (a.k.a. \"Wednesday is Missing\"), which first aired on [[CBS]] [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning]], on September 23, 1972. Four members of the original cast ([[John Astin]], [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Jackie Coogan]], and [[Ted Cassidy]]) returned for the special, which involved the Addamses in a mystery with the [[Scooby-Doo]] gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. After the episode aired, fans wanted more animated adventures featuring the Addamses, and Hanna-Barbera obliged.\n\n====''The Addams Family Fun-House'' (1973)====\nIn late 1972, [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] produced a pilot for a live-action musical variety show which was titled ''The Addams Family Fun-House''. The cast included [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] and [[Liz Torres]] as Gomez and Morticia (the pair also co-wrote the special), [[Stubby Kaye]] as Uncle Fester, [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]] as Lurch and [[Butch Patrick]] (who had played [[Eddie Munster]] on ''[[The Munsters]]'') as Pugsley. [[Felix Silla]] reprised his role as Cousin Itt, connecting it to the original TV series. The pilot aired in 1973, but it was not picked up for a series.<ref>{{cite web | author=MemorableTV.com | url=http://www.memorabletv.com/a/the-addams-family-funhouse.html | title=The Addams Family Fun-House | publisher=MemorableTV.com | accessdate=2010-12-04 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305114814/http://www.memorabletv.com/a/the-addams-family-funhouse.html | archivedate=March 5, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====''The Addams Family'' (1973)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1973 animated series)}}\nThe first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1975 on [[NBC]]. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] [[mobile home|RV]]. This series also marked the point where the relationships between the characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez's brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia's mother (though the old relationships between the characters would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, in order to retain its continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not, their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents [[Lennie Weinrib]] as Gomez and [[Janet Waldo]] as Morticia, while a ten-year-old [[Jodie Foster]] provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. A complementary comic book series was produced in connection with the show, but it only lasted three issues. The show's theme music was completely different and it had no lyrics and no finger snaps, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.\n\n====''Halloween with the New Addams Family'' (1977)====\n{{Main|Halloween with the New Addams Family}}\nA television reunion movie, ''[[Halloween with the New Addams Family]]'', aired on [[NBC]] on Sunday, October 30, 1977. It features most of the original cast, except [[Blossom Rock]], who had played Grandmama.  She was still alive but was very ill at the time; she was replaced by Jane Rose. Veteran character actors [[Parley Baer]] and [[Vito Scotti]], who both had recurring roles on the original series, also appeared in the movie. The movie has a slightly different version of the theme song; the finger snaps are used but not the lyrics.\n\nGomez and Morticia have had two more children, Wednesday, Jr. and Pugsley, Jr., who strongly resemble their older siblings. Gomez's brother, Pancho, is staying with the family while Gomez attends a lodge meeting in [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. Gomez is jealous of his brother, who once courted Morticia. [[Halloween]] is nigh, and Pancho tells the children the legend of the [[Great Pumpkin]]-like character of Cousin Shy, who distributes gifts and carves pumpkins for good children on Halloween night. Wednesday (now called \"Wednesday, Sr.\") is home from music academy, where she is studying the [[piccolo]] (breaking glass with it). Pugsley (now \"Pugsley, Sr.\") is home from [[Nairobi]] medical school, where he is training to be a [[witch doctor]]. The family's home has been bugged by a gang of crooks which intends to steal the family's fortune. Lafferty, the boss, sends a gang member named Mikey into the house to investigate. Mikey panics and flees after treading on the tail of Kitty Kat the lion. The crooks employ a fake Gomez and Morticia to help them carry out their plans, along with two strong-arm goons, Hercules and Atlas. Gomez returns home to celebrate the Halloween party and trim the [[scarecrow]]. Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to gain entrance to the house during the party. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia, and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who is still in love with Morticia, and Ophelia, who is still in love with Gomez. Gomez and Morticia escape (thanks to the \"Old Piccolo Game\"), and rejoin the party, only to have Lafferty use various methods to try to get rid of them. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies Lafferty's other assistant. Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat's tail. When the police arrive, the crooks gladly surrender. The Addamses are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.\n\n====''The Addams Family: The Animated Series'' (1992\u20131993)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1992 animated series)}}\nThe [[remake]] series ran on Saturday mornings from 1992 to 1993 on ABC after producers realized the success of the [[The Addams Family (1991 film)|1991 ''Addams Family'' movie]]. This series returned to the familiar format of the [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|original series]], with the Addams Family facing their sitcom situations at home. John Astin returned to the role of Gomez, and celebrities [[Rip Taylor]] and [[Carol Channing]] took over the roles of Fester and Grandmama, respectively. Veteran voice actors [[Jim Cummings]], [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Jeannie Elias]] and [[Pat Fraley]] did the voices of Lurch, Wednesday, Pugsley and Cousin Itt, respectively. New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original cartoons. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Addams Family movies, but her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show. The original [[Vic Mizzy]] [[theme song]], although slightly different, was used for the opening.\n\n====''The New Addams Family'' (1998\u20131999)====\n{{Main|The New Addams Family}}\n''[[The New Addams Family]]'' was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, and ran for 65 episodes (one more than the original TV series) during the 1998\u20131999 season on the then-newly launched [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]]. Many storylines from the original series were reworked for this new series, incorporating more modern elements and jokes. John Astin returned to the franchise in some episodes of this series, albeit as \"Grandpapa\" Addams (Gomez's grandfather, a character introduced in ''Addams Family Reunion''). The cast included Glenn Taranto as Gomez Addams, Ellie Harvie as Morticia, Michael Roberds as Fester, Brody Smith as Pugsley, Nicole Fugere (the only cast member from ''Addams Family Reunion'' to return) as Wednesday, [[John DeSantis]] as Lurch, Betty Phillips as Grandmama and Steven Fox as Thing.\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width:100%;\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Crew/Detail\n! colspan=\"3\"| Films\n!

Due to the studio's financial troubles at the time, Orion sold the US rights to the film to [[Paramount Pictures]]. On October 1, 2019, [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Addams Family & Addams Family Values Double Feature |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25382 |website=Blu-ray.com}}</ref> released double feature of ''Addams Family'' and ''Addams Family Values'' on Blu-ray in the United States.\n\n====''Addams Family Values'' (1993)====\n{{Main|Addams Family Values}}\nUpon the last film's success, a sequel followed: ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (released on November 19, 1993, with worldwide distribution by Paramount). Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the original spirit of the Addams cartoons (in fact, several gags were lifted straight from the single-panel cartoons). The two films used the same cast, except for Grandmama, played by Judith Malina and Carol Kane in the first and second films, respectively. A script for a third film was prepared in 1994, but was abandoned after the sudden death of actor [[Raul Julia]] that year.\n\n====''Addams Family Reunion'' (1998)====\n{{Main|Addams Family Reunion}}\nAnother film, ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] on September 22, 1998, this time by [[Warner Bros.]] through its video division. It has no relation to the Paramount movies, being in fact a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, ''The New Addams Family'', produced and shot in Canada. The third movie's Gomez, played by [[Tim Curry]], follows the style of Raul Julia, while the new sitcom's Gomez, played by [[Glenn Taranto]], is played in the style of John Astin, who had played the character in the 1960s. The only actors in this Warner Bros./[[Saban Entertainment]] production to have played in the previous Paramount films were Carel Struycken as Lurch and Christopher Hart as Thing.\n\n====Canceled film====\nIn 2010, it was announced that [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]], in partnership with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mike Fleming |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family/ |title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?

[[ICOM Simulations]] published ''[[The Addams Family (video game)#ICOM Simulations|The Addams Family]]'' video game for the [[TurboGrafx CD|TurboGrafx-CD]] in 1991.\n* The games' sequel, ''[[The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt]]'' (1993), also by [[Ocean Software]], was based on the ABC animated series and was released for NES, SNES, and Game Boy (although the latter two were just 8-bit remakes of the first SNES game, swapping Pugsley's and Gomez's roles).\n* ''[[Addams Family Values (video game)|Addams Family Values]]'' (1994) by Ocean was based on the movie's sequel and returned to the style of gameplay seen in ''Fester's Quest''.\n* A [[Game Boy Color]] game was released in the 1990s for promotion of ''The New Addams Family''. The game was titled ''[[The New Addams Family Series]]''. In this game, the Addams mansion had been bought by a fictional company called \"Funnyday\" that wanted to tear down the house and surrounding grounds to make room for an amusement park.\n* An arcade shocker, ''The New Addams Family Electric Shock Machine'' (also known as ''Electrifying'') was released by Eurocom and Nova Productions in 1999.\n*There is also one 2019-mobile game for android and IOS: ''The Addams Family Mystery Mansion'' released by [[Animoca]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.addamsfamily.game |title = Addams Family Mystery Mansion Mobile Game for iOS & Android}}</ref>\n\n===Pinball===\n{{See|The Addams Family (pinball)}}\nA [[pinball]] game by [[Midway Games|Midway]] (under the [[Bally Technologies|Bally]] label) was released in 1992 shortly after the movie.

The book details the family's arrival in their new home and explains how it got its bizarre d\u00e9cor. The arrival and origins of Thing are explained. Each chapter reads as a self-contained story, like episodes of the television show. The novel concludes with the Addams family discovering that their lives will be the basis for a new television series. It was published in paperback by [[Pyramid Books]] in 1965.<ref name=\"Publication: The Addams Family\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?287600|title=Publication: The Addams Family|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n\n====''The Addams Family Strikes Back''====\n''The Addams Family Strikes Back'' by W.F. Miksch tells how Gomez plans to rehabilitate the image of [[Benedict Arnold]] by running for the local school board. The tone and characterizations in this book resemble the TV characters much more closely than in the first novel. Cousin Itt appears as a minor character in this story, but as a tiny, three-legged creature rather than the hairy, derby-hatted character seen on television and in the movies.

The Addams Family originally included [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Morticia Addams]], their children [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]], close family members [[Uncle Fester]]{{efn|name=Character1}} and [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]],{{efn|name=Character2|Just like Fester, there are canonical differences between the various incarnations of Grandmamma Addams. In the two live-action feature films, both animated series, and the 1998 television film, she is portrayed Morticia's mother. In his notes for the original cartoons, Charles Addams even refers to her as Grandma Frump, rendering her Wednesday's and Pugsley's maternal grandmother.\n<ref name=evilution/>{{rp|2}} In the 1964 television series and the 2019 animated film, however, she is portrayed as Gomez's mother.}} their butler [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], and Pugsley's pet octopus Aristotle. The dimly seen [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]] (later a disembodied hand) was introduced in 1954, and Gomez's [[Cousin Itt]] and Mortica's pet lion, Kitty Kat in 1964.{{efn|name=Character3}}\n\nThe Addamses are a [[satire|satirical]] inversion of the ideal [[History of the United States (1918\u201345)|20th-century American]] family: an odd wealthy [[American gentry|aristocratic]] clan who delight in the [[macabre]] and are seemingly unaware or unconcerned that other people find them bizarre or frightening. They originally appeared as an unrelated group of 150 single-panel cartoons, about half of which were originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' between their debut in 1938 and Charles Addams' death in 1988. They have since been adapted to other media. In 1964, a [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|live-action television series]], starring [[John Astin]] and [[Carolyn Jones]], premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and subsequently inspired a [[Halloween with the New Addams Family|1977 television film]] and cameos from the cast [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies|in other shows]]. An unrelated [[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|animated series]] aired in 1973. The franchise was revived in the 1990s with a feature film series consisting of ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (1991) and ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (1993). Both received nominations for [[Academy Award]]s, [[BAFTA Award]]s, and [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Awards]]. For her role as Morticia, [[Anjelica Huston]] was twice nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]], and [[Raul Julia]] (as Gomez), [[Christina Ricci]] (as Wednesday), [[Christopher Lloyd]] (as Fester), and [[Joan Cusack]] (as Fester's wife, Debbie Jellinsky, in the sequel) received multiple [[Saturn Award]] and [[American Comedy Award]] nominations for their portrayals.  The films inspired a [[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|second animated series]] (1992\u20131993) which is set in the same fictional universe but with Astin reprising his role as the voice of Gomez. It was nominated for four [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], including one for Astin. Following Julia's death, the series was rebooted with a [[Addams Family Reunion|1998 direct-to-video film]] starring [[Tim Curry]] and [[Daryl Hannah]], and a [[The New Addams Family|spin-off live-action television series]] (1998\u20131999). A decade later, a [[The Addams Family (musical)|live musical adaptation]] featuring [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]] opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was nominated for two [[Tony Award]]s and eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s. The franchise has become a staple of [[The Addams Family#Homages and adaptations|popular culture]] and it has also spawned [[The Addams Family (video game series)|a video game series]], [[The Addams Family: An Evilution|academic books]], and soundtracks which are based around its [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording \u2013 Special or Novel Effects|Grammy]]-nominated [[The Addams Family Theme|theme song]].\n\nThe family has had a profound influence on [[American comic book|American comics]], [[Cinema of the United States|cinema]] and [[Television in the United States|television]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Stephen|title=The Addams Family: Volume One|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-addams-family-volume-one/|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=[[Pop Matters]]|date=December 3, 2016|quote=''The Addams Family'' [...] left an indelible mark on pop culture [...] was an obvious influence on future pop culture icons [...] gained a loyal cult following, and [...] influenced the work of future ghoulmeisters like [[Tim Burton]].}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Mankoff, Bob|title=Charles Addams|url=http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/charles-addams|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=March 11, 2010|quote=I think [Charles Addams'] influence is, like the man, largish.

They are a close-knit [[extended family]]. Morticia is an exemplary mother, and she and Gomez remain passionate towards each other; as established in the television series, she calls him [[Yiddish words used in English#B|\"bubbeleh\"]],<ref>[[Austro-Bavarian]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: Lit. \"little boy\"</ref> to which he responds by kissing her arms, behavior which Morticia can also provoke by speaking a few words in [[French language|French]] (their meanings are not important; any words in French will do). The parents are supportive of their children. The family is friendly and hospitable to visitors, in some cases it is willing to donate large sums of money to causes (television series and films), despite the visitors' horror at the Addamses' peculiar lifestyle.\n\nCharles Addams began as a cartoonist in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932.<ref name=maslin/> His cartoons ran regularly in the magazine from 1938, when he drew the first instance of what came to be called The Addams Family, until his death in 1988.<ref name=maslin>{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/books/26masl.html |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=In Search of the Dark Muse of a Master of the Macabre |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=October 26, 2006 |page=E9 |accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Addams met [[science fiction]] writer [[Ray Bradbury]] after drawing an illustration for Bradbury's short story \"Homecoming\" in ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine, the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois monsters, the Elliotts. Bradbury and Addams became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history, with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations; but it never materialized. Bradbury's Elliott Family stories were anthologized in ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'' (2001), with a connecting narrative, an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams's 1946 ''Mademoiselle'' illustration used for the book's cover jacket. Although Addams's own characters were well established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury states that Addams \"went his way and created the Addams Family and I went my own way and created my family in this book.\"<ref>{{cite web | first=Gavin J. | last=Grant | url=http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray | title=Ray Bradbury Interview Part 1 | publisher=[[IndieBound#IndieBound.org|IndieBound]] | year=2000 | accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Television===\n{{Series overview\n|auxA1=[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1964)]]\n|auxA3=[[The Addams Family (1973 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1973)]]\n|auxA4=[[The Addams Family (1992 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' (1992)]]\n|auxA6=''[[The New Addams Family]]''\n|auxA=Series\n|caption=Overview for ''The Addams Family'' TV series and specials\n|color1=000000\n|color2=4a4a4a\n|color2S=000070\n|color3=345F5F\n|color3S=00f\n|color4=000\n|color5=84ab14\n|color6=000\n|end1={{End date|1965|5|21}}\n|end2={{End date|1966|4|8}}\n|end3={{End date|1973|12|22}}\n|end4={{End date|1992|12|5}}\n|end5={{End date|1993|11|6}}\n|end6={{End date|1999|8|28}}\n|episodes1=34\n|episodes2=30\n|episodes3=16\n|episodes4=13\n|episodes5=8\n|episodes6=65\n|link1=List of The Addams Family episodes#Season 1 (1964\u201365)\n|link2=List of The Addams Family episodes#Season 2 (1965\u201366)\n|link2S=List of The New Scooby-Doo Movies episodes#ep3\n|link3=The Addams Family (1973 TV series)#Episodes\n|link3S=Halloween with the New Addams Family\n|link4=The Addams Family (1992 TV series)#Season 1 (1992)\n|link5=The Addams Family (1992 TV series)#Season 2 (1993)\n|link6=The New Addams Family#Episodes\n|linkT2S=''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' crossover\n|linkT3S=Halloween special\n|network1=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|network2S=[[CBS]]\n|network3=[[NBC]]\n|network4=ABC\n|network6=[[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] <small>(Canada)</small><br>[[History of Freeform (TV channel)#Fox Family|Fox Family Channel]] <small>(United States)</small>\n|start1={{Start date|1964|9|18}}\n|start2={{Start date|1965|9|17}}\n|start2S={{Start date|1972|9|23}}\n|start3={{Start date|1973|9|8}}\n|start3S={{Start date|1977|10|30}}\n|start4={{Start date|1992|9|12}}\n|start5={{Start date|1993|9|18}}\n|start6={{Start date|1998|10|19}}\n}}\n====''The Addams Family'' (1964\u20131966)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1964 TV series)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nIn 1964, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC TV]] network created [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' television series]] based on Addams's cartoon characters. The series was shot in [[black-and-white]] and aired for two seasons in 64 half-hour episodes (September 18, 1964 \u2013 September 2, 1966). During the original television run of ''The Addams Family'' television series, ''The New Yorker'' editor [[William Shawn]] refused to publish any ''Addams Family'' cartoons, though he continued to publish other Charles Addams cartoons. Shawn regarded his magazine as targeting a more refined readership and he did not want it to be associated with characters who could be seen on television by just anybody. After Shawn's 1987 retirement, the characters were welcomed back to ''The New Yorker''.\n\n====''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' (1972)====\nThe Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\" (a.k.a. \"Wednesday is Missing\"), which first aired on [[CBS]] [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning]], on September 23, 1972. Four members of the original cast ([[John Astin]], [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Jackie Coogan]], and [[Ted Cassidy]]) returned for the special, which involved the Addamses in a mystery with the [[Scooby-Doo]] gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. After the episode aired, fans wanted more animated adventures featuring the Addamses, and Hanna-Barbera obliged.\n\n====''The Addams Family Fun-House'' (1973)====\nIn late 1972, [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] produced a pilot for a live-action musical variety show which was titled ''The Addams Family Fun-House''. The cast included [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] and [[Liz Torres]] as Gomez and Morticia (the pair also co-wrote the special), [[Stubby Kaye]] as Uncle Fester, [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]] as Lurch and [[Butch Patrick]] (who had played [[Eddie Munster]] on ''[[The Munsters]]'') as Pugsley. [[Felix Silla]] reprised his role as Cousin Itt, connecting it to the original TV series. The pilot aired in 1973, but it was not picked up for a series.<ref>{{cite web | author=MemorableTV.com | url=http://www.memorabletv.com/a/the-addams-family-funhouse.html | title=The Addams Family Fun-House | publisher=MemorableTV.com | accessdate=2010-12-04 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305114814/http://www.memorabletv.com/a/the-addams-family-funhouse.html | archivedate=March 5, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====''The Addams Family'' (1973)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1973 animated series)}}\nThe first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1975 on [[NBC]]. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] [[mobile home|RV]]. This series also marked the point where the relationships between the characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez's brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia's mother (though the old relationships between the characters would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, in order to retain its continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not, their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents [[Lennie Weinrib]] as Gomez and [[Janet Waldo]] as Morticia, while a ten-year-old [[Jodie Foster]] provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. A complementary comic book series was produced in connection with the show, but it only lasted three issues. The show's theme music was completely different and it had no lyrics and no finger snaps, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.\n\n====''Halloween with the New Addams Family'' (1977)====\n{{Main|Halloween with the New Addams Family}}\nA television reunion movie, ''[[Halloween with the New Addams Family]]'', aired on [[NBC]] on Sunday, October 30, 1977. It features most of the original cast, except [[Blossom Rock]], who had played Grandmama.  She was still alive but was very ill at the time; she was replaced by Jane Rose. Veteran character actors [[Parley Baer]] and [[Vito Scotti]], who both had recurring roles on the original series, also appeared in the movie. The movie has a slightly different version of the theme song; the finger snaps are used but not the lyrics.\n\nGomez and Morticia have had two more children, Wednesday, Jr. and Pugsley, Jr., who strongly resemble their older siblings. Gomez's brother, Pancho, is staying with the family while Gomez attends a lodge meeting in [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. Gomez is jealous of his brother, who once courted Morticia. [[Halloween]] is nigh, and Pancho tells the children the legend of the [[Great Pumpkin]]-like character of Cousin Shy, who distributes gifts and carves pumpkins for good children on Halloween night. Wednesday (now called \"Wednesday, Sr.\") is home from music academy, where she is studying the [[piccolo]] (breaking glass with it). Pugsley (now \"Pugsley, Sr.\") is home from [[Nairobi]] medical school, where he is training to be a [[witch doctor]]. The family's home has been bugged by a gang of crooks which intends to steal the family's fortune. Lafferty, the boss, sends a gang member named Mikey into the house to investigate. Mikey panics and flees after treading on the tail of Kitty Kat the lion. The crooks employ a fake Gomez and Morticia to help them carry out their plans, along with two strong-arm goons, Hercules and Atlas. Gomez returns home to celebrate the Halloween party and trim the [[scarecrow]]. Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to gain entrance to the house during the party. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia, and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who is still in love with Morticia, and Ophelia, who is still in love with Gomez. Gomez and Morticia escape (thanks to the \"Old Piccolo Game\"), and rejoin the party, only to have Lafferty use various methods to try to get rid of them. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies Lafferty's other assistant. Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat's tail. When the police arrive, the crooks gladly surrender. The Addamses are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.\n\n====''The Addams Family: The Animated Series'' (1992\u20131993)====\n{{Main|The Addams Family (1992 animated series)}}\nThe [[remake]] series ran on Saturday mornings from 1992 to 1993 on ABC after producers realized the success of the [[The Addams Family (1991 film)|1991 ''Addams Family'' movie]]. This series returned to the familiar format of the [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|original series]], with the Addams Family facing their sitcom situations at home. John Astin returned to the role of Gomez, and celebrities [[Rip Taylor]] and [[Carol Channing]] took over the roles of Fester and Grandmama, respectively. Veteran voice actors [[Jim Cummings]], [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Jeannie Elias]] and [[Pat Fraley]] did the voices of Lurch, Wednesday, Pugsley and Cousin Itt, respectively. New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original cartoons. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Addams Family movies, but her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show. The original [[Vic Mizzy]] [[theme song]], although slightly different, was used for the opening.\n\n====''The New Addams Family'' (1998\u20131999)====\n{{Main|The New Addams Family}}\n''[[The New Addams Family]]'' was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, and ran for 65 episodes (one more than the original TV series) during the 1998\u20131999 season on the then-newly launched [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]]. Many storylines from the original series were reworked for this new series, incorporating more modern elements and jokes. John Astin returned to the franchise in some episodes of this series, albeit as \"Grandpapa\" Addams (Gomez's grandfather, a character introduced in ''Addams Family Reunion''). The cast included Glenn Taranto as Gomez Addams, Ellie Harvie as Morticia, Michael Roberds as Fester, Brody Smith as Pugsley, Nicole Fugere (the only cast member from ''Addams Family Reunion'' to return) as Wednesday, [[John DeSantis]] as Lurch, Betty Phillips as Grandmama and Steven Fox as Thing.\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width:100%;\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Crew/Detail\n! colspan=\"3\"| Films\n!

Due to the studio's financial troubles at the time, Orion sold the US rights to the film to [[Paramount Pictures]]. On October 1, 2019, [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Addams Family & Addams Family Values Double Feature |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25382 |website=Blu-ray.com}}</ref> released double feature of ''Addams Family'' and ''Addams Family Values'' on Blu-ray in the United States.\n\n====''Addams Family Values'' (1993)====\n{{Main|Addams Family Values}}\nUpon the last film's success, a sequel followed: ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (released on November 19, 1993, with worldwide distribution by Paramount). Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the original spirit of the Addams cartoons (in fact, several gags were lifted straight from the single-panel cartoons). The two films used the same cast, except for Grandmama, played by Judith Malina and Carol Kane in the first and second films, respectively. A script for a third film was prepared in 1994, but was abandoned after the sudden death of actor [[Raul Julia]] that year.\n\n====''Addams Family Reunion'' (1998)====\n{{Main|Addams Family Reunion}}\nAnother film, ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] on September 22, 1998, this time by [[Warner Bros.]] through its video division. It has no relation to the Paramount movies, being in fact a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, ''The New Addams Family'', produced and shot in Canada. The third movie's Gomez, played by [[Tim Curry]], follows the style of Raul Julia, while the new sitcom's Gomez, played by [[Glenn Taranto]], is played in the style of John Astin, who had played the character in the 1960s. The only actors in this Warner Bros./[[Saban Entertainment]] production to have played in the previous Paramount films were Carel Struycken as Lurch and Christopher Hart as Thing.\n\n====Canceled film====\nIn 2010, it was announced that [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]], in partnership with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mike Fleming |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family/ |title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?

As the health of Raeburn broke down, Mallory assumed responsibility for most of the exploration to the north and east of the mountain. He wrote to his wife: \"We are about to walk off the map...\" After five months of arduous climbing around the base of the mountain, Wheeler explored the hidden East Rongbuk Glacier and its route to the base of the North Col. On September 23, Mallory became the first person to set foot on the mountain and he, Bullock, and Wheeler reached the [[North Col]] at {{convert|7020|m|ft|-1}} before being forced back by strong winds.{{sfn|Gillman|1993|pp=24\u201325}} To Mallory's experienced eye, the route up the North ridge intersecting the NE Ridge and from there to the summit looked long, but feasible for a fresher party.<ref name=davis />\n\n=== 1922: First attempt ===\n{{Main|1922 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nThe second British expedition, under General [[Charles Granville Bruce]] and climbing leader [[Edward Lisle Strutt|Lt-Col. Edward Lisle Strutt]], and containing Mallory, returned for a full-scale attempt on the mountain. On May 22, they climbed to 8,170&nbsp;m (26,800&nbsp;ft) on the North Ridge before retreating. They were the first humans to climb above {{convert|8000|m|ft}} on a mountain.  The scope of this accomplishment is reflected by the fact that there are only 14 mountains on earth\u2014the [[eight-thousanders]]\u2014that reach and exceed 8,000 metres. At that moment, Mallory and Strutt had exceeded the summit of all but five other mountains on the planet.\n\nA day later, [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] climbed up the North Ridge and Face to 8,320&nbsp;m (27,300&nbsp;ft) using oxygen for the first time. They climbed from the North Col to their highest camp at a phenomenal rate of 900 vert-ft/hr., and were the first climbers to sleep using oxygen.\n\n===1924: Mallory and Irvine===\n{{Main|1924 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nThe third British expedition was led by [[Charles Granville Bruce|Brigadier-General Charles Bruce]], although becoming indisposed as a result of a flare-up of malaria, he relinquished leadership of the expedition to [[Edward Felix Norton|Lt-Col. Edward Norton]], with Mallory promoted to climbing leader. Geoffrey Bruce, [[Howard Somervell]], and John Noel returned from the previous year, along with newcomers [[Noel Odell]] and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]].\n\nOn June 2, Mallory and Bruce set off from the North Col (C-4) to make the first summit attempt. But extreme wind and cold, exhaustion, and the refusal of the porters to carry farther led Mallory to abandon the attempt and the next day the party returned to the North Col camp.\nOn June 4, Norton and Somervell attempted an oxygenless summit in perfect weather; throat trouble forced Somervell to abandon the climb at about 28,000 feet (8534&nbsp;m) while Norton continued on alone, reaching a height of 8,573&nbsp;m (28,126&nbsp;ft), just 275&nbsp;m (900&nbsp;ft) short of the summit. Exhausted, he turned back and rejoined Somervell for the descent.\n\nOn June 8, Mallory and Irvine left their high camp (C-6 at 26,900-ft) to attempt the summit, using Irvine's modified oxygen apparatus. Odell, climbing in support below, wrote in his diary that at 26,000-ft he \"saw Mallory & Irvine on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramid\" climbing what he thought at the time was the very difficult Second Step at 12:50&nbsp;p.m. It was the last time the two were seen; whether either of them reached the summit remains a question that has reverberated through the decades.\n\nBack in England, the climbing establishment pressured Odell to change his view. After about six months he began to equivocate on which Step it was he saw them\u2014from the Second to possibly the First. If the First, they had no chance of having reached the top; if the Second, they would have had about three hours of oxygen each and the summit was at least three hours away. It is conceivable (though unlikely) that Mallory might have taken Irvine's remaining oxygen and attempted to reach the summit.\n\nA much-more-probable scenario is that the two reached First Step at about 10:30 am. Mallory, seeing the treacherous nature of the traverse to the Second Step, went it alone. He reconnoitered the base of the climbing crux and decided it was not for him that day. He returned, picked up Irvine and the two decided to climb the First Step for a look around and to photograph the complex approach to the Second Step. It was when climbing this small promontory that they were spotted from below by Odell, who assumed that, since they were ascending, they must therefore have been on the Second Step, although it is now difficult to believe that the two would still be climbing from so low down at a time\u2014five hours late\u2014that was considered to be the turn-around hour.\nDescending from the First Step, the two continued down when, at 2 pm, they were hit by a severe snow squall. Roping up, Mallory, leading, may have slipped pulling himself and Irvine down. The rope must have caught to inflict severe rope-jerk injury around Mallory's (and presumably, Irvine's) waist. Some researchers believe Irvine was able to stay high and struggle along the crest of the NE Ridge another 100 yards, only to succumb to cold and possible injuries of the fall. Others believe that the two became separated after the fall by the near white-out conditions of the squall. Based on his final location, it would seem that Mallory had continued straight down in search of his partner, while Irvine, also injured, might have continued diagonally down through the [[Yellow Band]].\n\nIn 1979, climber Wang Hongbao of China revealed to the climbing leader of a Japanese expedition that in 1975, while taking a stroll from his bivouac he had discovered \"an English dead\" at 8100&nbsp;m, roughly below the site of Irvine's ice axe discovered in 1933 near the NE Ridge. Wang was killed in an avalanche the next day before he could provide additional details.\n\nIn 1999, however, [[Conrad Anker]] of the [[Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition]] found Mallory's body in the predicted search area near the old Chinese bivouac. There are opposing views within the [[mountaineering]] community as to whether the duo may have reached the summit 29 years before the first successful ascent by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953. Despite the existence of many theories, the success of Mallory and Irvine's summit assault must be viewed as remote at best.\n\nThe leading theory amongst those supporting the summit push has Mallory overcoming the difficulty of the sheer face of the Second Step by standing on Irvine's shoulders. Armed with Irvine's remaining 3/4-full oxygen tank he could conceivably have reached the summit late in the day, but this would have meant that Irvine would have had to descend by himself. However, rope-jerk injuries around Mallory's waist must mean the two were roped when they fell from below the First Step. 1960s Chinese Everest climber [[Xu Jing (mountaineer)|Xu Jing]] told Eric Simonson and Jochen Hemmleb in 2001 that he recalled spotting a corpse somewhere in the Yellow Band. Despite numerous searches of the north face, no sign of Irvine has turned up so far. One researcher claims to have finally spotted Irvine's body using microscopic examination of aerial photographs. This possible discovery set off a new round of search expeditions in 2010 and 2011.\n\n===1933: Ruttledge and Houston===\n{{Main|1933 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nA major expedition, under the leadership of [[Hugh Ruttledge]], set out to climb with the great expectations that this time they would succeed. Oxygen was taken but not used because of the incorrect but lingering belief that it was of little benefit to a properly acclimated climber. After delays caused by poor weather and illness of team members, a much higher assault camp was placed than in 1924. On the first summit attempt, [[Lawrence Wager]] and [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] intended to follow the Northeastern ridge, but were unable to regain it, having bypassed (rather than climb over) the First Step, which they reached at 7:00 am. The direct access to the Second Step from the First involves a treacherous traverse. Instead of taking it, they dropped down to follow the lower, easier traverse pioneered by Norton in 1924. Observing the Second Step from {{convert|30.5|m|ft}} below it, Wyn-Harris declared it \"unclimbable.\" Shortly after crossing the Great Couloir, they turned back for poor snow conditions and the lateness of the hour. A subsequent attempt by [[Eric Shipton]] and [[Frank Smythe]] followed the same route but Smythe, who pressed on alone when Shipton turned back because of illness, got no higher.<ref>Unsworth, Walt pp. 158\u2013184</ref>\n\n{{Main|Houston-Mount Everest flight expedition}}\n[[Lucy, Lady Houston]], a British [[millionaire]] former [[showgirl]], funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of [[airplane]]s led by the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Marquess of Clydesdale]] fly over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adventuress: The Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=189ff}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flymicro.com/everest/index.cfm?page=docs%2FHistory%2FAeroplanes.htm |title=Aeroplane expeditions to Everest |publisher=FlyMicro.com |accessdate=2010-02-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1934 ===\n* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Maurice Wilson]], a British [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], stated his intention to summit Everest by himself. After only a few flying lessons, Wilson flew illegally from Britain to [[India]], hiking through [[Darjeeling]] and into [[Tibet]] and with the help of Sherpa guides began his attempt. Wilson was not a climber and had no climbing equipment. He expected to transport himself to the summit with spiritual help and signal the monks at the Rongbuk monastery of his success with a shaving mirror. It is not believed he attained the North Col (7000&nbsp;m). Maurice Wilson's body and his diary were found wrapped in a tent in 1935 by another British expedition. Although dumped into a crevasse below the North Col, his body has been rediscovered a number of times, including in 1960 by the Chinese expedition. Unlike Mallory's body, Wilson's has decayed because the temperature at the head of the East Rongbuk Glacier does rise above freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/WhoclimbedEverestfirstJun262003.shtml |title=Who climbed Everest first? |accessdate=2010-02-13 |last=Noy |first=Thomas |date=26 June 2003 |publisher=Explorers Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/WhoclimbedEverestfirstPartIIofIIIJun272003.shtml |title=Who climbed Everest first?

Both were dismissed as impractical, though Shipton did decide that an ascent from the Western Cwm would be possible if entry from the [[Nepal]]ese side could be made. This would be the route by which the mountain would eventually be climbed in 1953.

They were the first people to stand in the Western Cwm. On May 27, four climbers ([[Raymond Lambert]], [[Tenzing Norgay]], [[Rene Aubert]], and [[Leon Flory]]) started from their tents on the South Col, two teams of Lambert/Tenzing and Aubert/Flory.

Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the [[University of Toronto]], told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on that day suggested that freak weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14%.<ref name=\"NewScientist\">{{cite journal\n | title = The day the sky fell on Everest\n | journal = New Scientist\n | volume =\n | issue = 2449\n | page = 15\n | publisher =\n | date = 29 May 2004\n | url = http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703183045/http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html\n | archivedate = 2007-07-03\n | accessdate = 2006-12-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"BioEd Online\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=986\n | title=High winds suck oxygen from Everest Predicting pressure lows could protect climbers.\n | accessdate=2006-12-11\n | last=Peplow\n | first=Mark\n | date=May 25, 2004\n | publisher=BioEd Online\n | quote=Moore explains that these jet streaks can drag a huge draught of air up the side of the mountain, lowering the air pressure.

Air at that altitude already contains only one third as much oxygen as sea-level air. }}</ref>\n\nDuring the same season, climber and filmmaker [[David Breashears]] and his team filmed the [[IMAX]] feature ''[[Everest (1998 film)|Everest]]'' on the mountain (some climbing scenes were later recreated for the film in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]). The 70&nbsp;mm IMAX camera was specially modified to be lightweight enough to carry up the mountain, and to function in the extreme cold with the use of particular greases on the mechanical parts, plastic bearings and special batteries. Production was halted as Breashears and his team assisted the survivors of the May 10 disaster, but the team eventually reached the top on May 23 and filmed the first large format footage of the summit. On Breashears' team was [[Jamling Tenzing Norgay]], the son of Norgay, following in his father's footsteps for the first time. Also on his team was [[Ed Viesturs]] of Seattle, WA, who summited without the use of supplemental oxygen, and [[Araceli Segarra]], who became the first woman from Spain to summit Everest.\n\nThe storm's impact on climbers on the mountain's other side, the North Ridge, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first hand account by British filmmaker and writer [[Matt Dickinson]] in his book ''The Other Side of Everest''.\n* {{flagicon|Nepal}}  Sherpa [[Ang Rita]] was the first person to summit ten times, between 7 May 1983 through 23 May 1996.\n* {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Hans Kammerlander]] climbed the mountain from the north side in the record ascent time of 17 hours from base camp to the summit.

As the health of Raeburn broke down, Mallory assumed responsibility for most of the exploration to the north and east of the mountain. He wrote to his wife: \"We are about to walk off the map...\" After five months of arduous climbing around the base of the mountain, Wheeler explored the hidden East Rongbuk Glacier and its route to the base of the North Col. On September 23, Mallory became the first person to set foot on the mountain and he, Bullock, and Wheeler reached the [[North Col]] at {{convert|7020|m|ft|-1}} before being forced back by strong winds.{{sfn|Gillman|1993|pp=24\u201325}} To Mallory's experienced eye, the route up the North ridge intersecting the NE Ridge and from there to the summit looked long, but feasible for a fresher party.<ref name=davis />\n\n=== 1922: First attempt ===\n{{Main|1922 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nThe second British expedition, under General [[Charles Granville Bruce]] and climbing leader [[Edward Lisle Strutt|Lt-Col. Edward Lisle Strutt]], and containing Mallory, returned for a full-scale attempt on the mountain. On May 22, they climbed to 8,170&nbsp;m (26,800&nbsp;ft) on the North Ridge before retreating. They were the first humans to climb above {{convert|8000|m|ft}} on a mountain.  The scope of this accomplishment is reflected by the fact that there are only 14 mountains on earth\u2014the [[eight-thousanders]]\u2014that reach and exceed 8,000 metres. At that moment, Mallory and Strutt had exceeded the summit of all but five other mountains on the planet.\n\nA day later, [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] climbed up the North Ridge and Face to 8,320&nbsp;m (27,300&nbsp;ft) using oxygen for the first time. They climbed from the North Col to their highest camp at a phenomenal rate of 900 vert-ft/hr., and were the first climbers to sleep using oxygen.\n\n===1924: Mallory and Irvine===\n{{Main|1924 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nThe third British expedition was led by [[Charles Granville Bruce|Brigadier-General Charles Bruce]], although becoming indisposed as a result of a flare-up of malaria, he relinquished leadership of the expedition to [[Edward Felix Norton|Lt-Col. Edward Norton]], with Mallory promoted to climbing leader. Geoffrey Bruce, [[Howard Somervell]], and John Noel returned from the previous year, along with newcomers [[Noel Odell]] and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]].\n\nOn June 2, Mallory and Bruce set off from the North Col (C-4) to make the first summit attempt. But extreme wind and cold, exhaustion, and the refusal of the porters to carry farther led Mallory to abandon the attempt and the next day the party returned to the North Col camp.\nOn June 4, Norton and Somervell attempted an oxygenless summit in perfect weather; throat trouble forced Somervell to abandon the climb at about 28,000 feet (8534&nbsp;m) while Norton continued on alone, reaching a height of 8,573&nbsp;m (28,126&nbsp;ft), just 275&nbsp;m (900&nbsp;ft) short of the summit. Exhausted, he turned back and rejoined Somervell for the descent.\n\nOn June 8, Mallory and Irvine left their high camp (C-6 at 26,900-ft) to attempt the summit, using Irvine's modified oxygen apparatus. Odell, climbing in support below, wrote in his diary that at 26,000-ft he \"saw Mallory & Irvine on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramid\" climbing what he thought at the time was the very difficult Second Step at 12:50&nbsp;p.m. It was the last time the two were seen; whether either of them reached the summit remains a question that has reverberated through the decades.\n\nBack in England, the climbing establishment pressured Odell to change his view. After about six months he began to equivocate on which Step it was he saw them\u2014from the Second to possibly the First. If the First, they had no chance of having reached the top; if the Second, they would have had about three hours of oxygen each and the summit was at least three hours away. It is conceivable (though unlikely) that Mallory might have taken Irvine's remaining oxygen and attempted to reach the summit.\n\nA much-more-probable scenario is that the two reached First Step at about 10:30 am. Mallory, seeing the treacherous nature of the traverse to the Second Step, went it alone. He reconnoitered the base of the climbing crux and decided it was not for him that day. He returned, picked up Irvine and the two decided to climb the First Step for a look around and to photograph the complex approach to the Second Step. It was when climbing this small promontory that they were spotted from below by Odell, who assumed that, since they were ascending, they must therefore have been on the Second Step, although it is now difficult to believe that the two would still be climbing from so low down at a time\u2014five hours late\u2014that was considered to be the turn-around hour.\nDescending from the First Step, the two continued down when, at 2 pm, they were hit by a severe snow squall. Roping up, Mallory, leading, may have slipped pulling himself and Irvine down. The rope must have caught to inflict severe rope-jerk injury around Mallory's (and presumably, Irvine's) waist. Some researchers believe Irvine was able to stay high and struggle along the crest of the NE Ridge another 100 yards, only to succumb to cold and possible injuries of the fall. Others believe that the two became separated after the fall by the near white-out conditions of the squall. Based on his final location, it would seem that Mallory had continued straight down in search of his partner, while Irvine, also injured, might have continued diagonally down through the [[Yellow Band]].\n\nIn 1979, climber Wang Hongbao of China revealed to the climbing leader of a Japanese expedition that in 1975, while taking a stroll from his bivouac he had discovered \"an English dead\" at 8100&nbsp;m, roughly below the site of Irvine's ice axe discovered in 1933 near the NE Ridge. Wang was killed in an avalanche the next day before he could provide additional details.\n\nIn 1999, however, [[Conrad Anker]] of the [[Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition]] found Mallory's body in the predicted search area near the old Chinese bivouac. There are opposing views within the [[mountaineering]] community as to whether the duo may have reached the summit 29 years before the first successful ascent by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953. Despite the existence of many theories, the success of Mallory and Irvine's summit assault must be viewed as remote at best.\n\nThe leading theory amongst those supporting the summit push has Mallory overcoming the difficulty of the sheer face of the Second Step by standing on Irvine's shoulders. Armed with Irvine's remaining 3/4-full oxygen tank he could conceivably have reached the summit late in the day, but this would have meant that Irvine would have had to descend by himself. However, rope-jerk injuries around Mallory's waist must mean the two were roped when they fell from below the First Step. 1960s Chinese Everest climber [[Xu Jing (mountaineer)|Xu Jing]] told Eric Simonson and Jochen Hemmleb in 2001 that he recalled spotting a corpse somewhere in the Yellow Band. Despite numerous searches of the north face, no sign of Irvine has turned up so far. One researcher claims to have finally spotted Irvine's body using microscopic examination of aerial photographs. This possible discovery set off a new round of search expeditions in 2010 and 2011.\n\n===1933: Ruttledge and Houston===\n{{Main|1933 British Mount Everest expedition}}\nA major expedition, under the leadership of [[Hugh Ruttledge]], set out to climb with the great expectations that this time they would succeed. Oxygen was taken but not used because of the incorrect but lingering belief that it was of little benefit to a properly acclimated climber. After delays caused by poor weather and illness of team members, a much higher assault camp was placed than in 1924. On the first summit attempt, [[Lawrence Wager]] and [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] intended to follow the Northeastern ridge, but were unable to regain it, having bypassed (rather than climb over) the First Step, which they reached at 7:00 am. The direct access to the Second Step from the First involves a treacherous traverse. Instead of taking it, they dropped down to follow the lower, easier traverse pioneered by Norton in 1924. Observing the Second Step from {{convert|30.5|m|ft}} below it, Wyn-Harris declared it \"unclimbable.\" Shortly after crossing the Great Couloir, they turned back for poor snow conditions and the lateness of the hour. A subsequent attempt by [[Eric Shipton]] and [[Frank Smythe]] followed the same route but Smythe, who pressed on alone when Shipton turned back because of illness, got no higher.<ref>Unsworth, Walt pp. 158\u2013184</ref>\n\n{{Main|Houston-Mount Everest flight expedition}}\n[[Lucy, Lady Houston]], a British [[millionaire]] former [[showgirl]], funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of [[airplane]]s led by the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Marquess of Clydesdale]] fly over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adventuress: The Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=189ff}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flymicro.com/everest/index.cfm?page=docs%2FHistory%2FAeroplanes.htm |title=Aeroplane expeditions to Everest |publisher=FlyMicro.com |accessdate=2010-02-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1934 ===\n* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Maurice Wilson]], a British [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], stated his intention to summit Everest by himself. After only a few flying lessons, Wilson flew illegally from Britain to [[India]], hiking through [[Darjeeling]] and into [[Tibet]] and with the help of Sherpa guides began his attempt. Wilson was not a climber and had no climbing equipment. He expected to transport himself to the summit with spiritual help and signal the monks at the Rongbuk monastery of his success with a shaving mirror. It is not believed he attained the North Col (7000&nbsp;m). Maurice Wilson's body and his diary were found wrapped in a tent in 1935 by another British expedition. Although dumped into a crevasse below the North Col, his body has been rediscovered a number of times, including in 1960 by the Chinese expedition. Unlike Mallory's body, Wilson's has decayed because the temperature at the head of the East Rongbuk Glacier does rise above freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/WhoclimbedEverestfirstJun262003.shtml |title=Who climbed Everest first? |accessdate=2010-02-13 |last=Noy |first=Thomas |date=26 June 2003 |publisher=Explorers Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/stories/WhoclimbedEverestfirstPartIIofIIIJun272003.shtml |title=Who climbed Everest first?

The first pair, [[Charles Evans (mountaineer)|Charles Evans]] and [[Tom Bourdillon]], using [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|closed-circuit oxygen sets]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.velocitypress.com/closed-circuit-alpine-oxygen-systems.html |title=Closed circuit oxygen system, high altitude oxygen |publisher=Velocity Press |year=2006 |accessdate=2016-04-13}}</ref>  achieved the first ascent of the {{convert|8750|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} South Summit, within as little as {{convert|100|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} of the final summit, but could go no further because of oxygen equipment problems and lack of time.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ascent of Everest|url=https://archive.org/details/ascentofeverest0000hunt|url-access=registration|first=John|last=Hunt|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=1953}}</ref> Two days later, the second assault was made with the fittest and most determined climbing pair. Using conventional [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|open-circuit oxygen sets]], the summit was eventually reached at 11:30&nbsp;a.m. local time on May 29, 1953 by the [[New Zealand]]er [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]], a [[Nepal]]i, climbing the South Col route. They paused at the summit to take photographs, Hillary saying after ten minutes taking photographs on the summit without his oxygen set on that he \"was becoming rather clumsy-fingered and slow-moving\".{{sfn|Hunt|1953|p=206}} They buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending. Although they characterized it as the culmination of a team effort by the whole expedition, there was intense public speculation as to which of the pair had set foot on the summit first. 1n 1955 Tenzing disclosed in his autobiography that it was Hillary. News of the expedition's success reached [[London]] on the morning of [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's coronation]]. ''Times'' reporter [[Jan Morris|James Morris]] sent a coded message by runner to [[Namche Bazaar]], where a wireless transmitter was used to relay the message to London. The conquest of Everest was probably the last major news item to be delivered to the world by runner.

Hall and Fischer were both highly experienced climbers who were leading paid expeditions to the summit.\n\nJournalist [[Jon Krakauer]], on assignment from ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, was in Hall's party. He published the bestseller ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' about the experience. [[Anatoli Boukreev]], a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer's book, co-authored a rebuttal book called ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]''. The dispute sparked a large debate within the climbing community. <!-- sentence regarding Krakauer as a personna non grata removed until someone cites a source --> In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L.

The 70&nbsp;mm IMAX camera was specially modified to be lightweight enough to carry up the mountain, and to function in the extreme cold with the use of particular greases on the mechanical parts, plastic bearings and special batteries. Production was halted as Breashears and his team assisted the survivors of the May 10 disaster, but the team eventually reached the top on May 23 and filmed the first large format footage of the summit. On Breashears' team was [[Jamling Tenzing Norgay]], the son of Norgay, following in his father's footsteps for the first time.

''Berberosaurus'' is distinguished from other theropods by anatomical details found in its [[vertebra]]e, [[metacarpus|metacarpals]], and hindlimb bones.

''Berberosaurus'' is distinguished from other theropods by anatomical details found in its [[vertebra]]e, [[metacarpus|metacarpals]], and hindlimb bones.

On 27 May 1971 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peaks]] climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before. The face itself was almost twice as high as the {{convert|6000|ft}} [[Eigerwand]] and even above the rock band there was another {{convert|3000|ft}} to the summit.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971b|p=18\u201333}}{{sfnp|Bonington|2017|p=155}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}  The topography near the summit could be assessed from photographs Bonington had taken on the Annapurna II expedition of ten years earlier.{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=411}}\n\n==Expedition planning and departure==\n{{external media|topic=Clip from TV programme|Annapurna|title=Annapurna South Face|headerimage=|caption=\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQE_65nk_p4 Annapurna: The Hardest Way Up]{{sfnp|Edwards|1971}}}}\nWith financial support for the expedition from the [[Mount Everest Foundation]], Bonington assembled a team from amongst his friends: [[Nick Estcourt]], [[Martin Boysen]], [[Ian Clough]], Mike Thompson, Burke and Haston. Advised to include an American to boost sales of the book he was planning, Bonington appointed [[Tom Frost]] who had considerable [[big wall]] experience in [[Yosemite]] as well as \u2013 secretly at the time \u2013 [[Nanda Devi]] on a [[Nanda Devi#CIA mission|CIA mission]] to install a nuclear-powered listening device for monitoring [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese missiles]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}} Frost was known to and respected by Haston and [[Don Whillans]]. Whillans was to be deputy leader for, although by then he was an overweight heavy drinker and smoker who disliked Bonington, he had more Himalayan experience than any other British mountaineer still active.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=389\u2013390}} Indeed, only he, Bonington and Clough had been to Himalaya at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1986|p=16}} Also included as climbers were [[Kelvin Kent (mountaineer)|Kelvin Kent]], base camp manager, and David Lambert, the doctor. A four-man television team from [[ITN]] and [[Thames Television]] was to be accompanying them.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=414}}\n\nThey took {{convert|18000|ft}} of rope for fixing (they did not use their climbing rope), 40 cylinders of Oxygen and six breathing sets.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=246,257}} The baggage was sent from London by sea with Whillans and Lambert flying to [[Bombay]]{{refn|group=note|[[Mumbai]] is the present name.}} to see to its unloading and transport to [[Pokhara]] by lorry. However, the ship was then delayed by about three weeks so Bonington arranged for Whillans and Lambert to travel to [[Kathmandu]] to reconnoitre the approach route instead of waiting at Bombay, and Clough would go to Bombay to deal with the baggage.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29\u201331,39}} They took oxygen cylinders intending to use supplementary oxygen above about {{convert|22500|ft}} but it was very little used for climbing and not at all above Camp VI. It was used, however, for people who had become ill.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=257\u2013259}}\n\n== March-in and Base Camp ==\n[[File:1970 Annapurna south face expedition approach route.svg|thumb|Approach route from [[Pokhara]] to Annapurna Base Camp]]\nIn March 1970 the expedition flew to Kathmandu and then on to [[Pokhara]] from where the trek to the southern vicinity of Annapurna was along an easy route. Unlike twenty years earlier when [[Maurice Herzog|Herzog]] had no satisfactory map and had to pioneer a route, by 1970 the track was well known even to [[hippie]] wanderers.{{refn|group=note|The eight-day trek route from Pokhara went up beside the [[Seti Gandaki River|Seti Khola]] river and then the Modi Khola (a tributary of the [[Gandaki river]]). Bonington notes passing through [[Naudanda]], [[Lumle]], Chondracot (now Chandrakot), Ghandrung (now [[Ghandruk]]), Chomro (now Chhomrong), Thomo and Hinko Cave.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=47\u201350,54,79}}}} Another change was that the Sherpas were no longer unsophisticated peasants \u2013 they were smart in appearance, spoke good English and had a Western attitude. [[Pasang Kami]], the sirdar, treated the sahibs as equals and this was reciprocated. The other Sherpas were Pemba Tharkay, Ang Pema, Mingma Tsering, Nima Tsering and Kancha. As it turned out, a group from the British Army Mountaineering Association, led by [[Henry Day (colonel)|Henry Day]], was setting off at the same time for an ascent on Herzog's north face route and they had greatly helped Bonington by flying out {{convert|1500|lb}} of baggage to supply him until his main baggage arrived.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=390\u2013391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29,39,43,238}}{{sfnp|Day|1971|p=89}}\n\nOn 16 March Whillans, Thompson and two Sherpas went ahead of the main parties to reconnoitre the route and to find a suitable place for the base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=38\u201339}} A temporary location was found to be at the entrance to the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] at the location of a previous base camp: that of the 1957 expedition to [[Machapuchare]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,51}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=416}}\nThe slower-moving baggage train of 140 porters set off from Pokhara on 22 March and Clough with his 240 porters was able to leave Bombay with the delayed baggage on 24 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=42,53,81}}\n\nBonington and Whillans met up on 27 March and Whillans said he thought he and his Sherpas had seen a [[yeti]] and had photographed the footprints.

Bonington and Burke relocated the lower part of the route hoping to make it suitable for porters.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe ridge they were to use at the start of the climb was straightforwardly approached across the glacier but steep cliff barred the way onto the ridge itself so they skirted these on the right to reach a site for Camp II, lower than hoped for but with nowhere suitable immediately higher. For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}}\n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n==Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band==\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n==Above Camp V==\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}}\n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n==Summit==\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n==Leaving the mountain==\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair.

On 27 May 1971 [[Don Whillans]] and [[Dougal Haston]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna I]] which at {{convert|26545|ft}} is the highest peak in the [[Annapurna Massif]] in [[Nepal]]. [[Chris Bonington]] led the expedition which approached up a glacier from the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] and then used rock climbing techniques to put [[fixed rope]]s up the steep South Face. Although the plan had been to use supplementary oxygen, in the event it was not possible to carry any cylinders high enough for the lead climbers to use on their summit bid.\n\nLow down on the mountain, on 30 May as the expedition was about to leave, [[Ian Clough]] was killed by a falling [[serac]]. Several members of the expedition rose to fame in Britain, and as a whole the expedition received international recognition in mountaineering circles on account of its innovative and extremely difficult nature.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Annapurna ===\n{{see also|Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal}}\nThe [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna massif]] is in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]a region of Nepal where for over one hundred years the ruling [[Rana dynasty]]  had not allowed explorers or mountaineers to enter the country.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=238\u2013241}}{{sfnp|Ward|Clark|1992}} In 1950 Nepal at last gave permission for the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]], to attempt [[Dhaulagiri]] or [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna I]], the two highest peaks in the Annapurna region. The expedition, led by [[Maurice Herzog]], mounted a successful summit attempt via the North Face. For most Himalayan mountains the easiest route to the summit is along a ridge route but for Annapurna the North Face is not too steep (though it is very exposed to avalanches) and the route subsequently turned out to be the easiest.{{sfnp|Herzog|1954|pp=48,54,57,102\u2013103}}{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=242\u2013253,387}} Although it was the first climbed of the eight-thousanders, Annapurna is not often climbed and there is a high death rate among those attempting it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Voiland |title=The Eight-Thousanders |url=https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/8000MeterPeaks |website=www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2013 |access-date=18 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503184334/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/8000MeterPeaks/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Start of rock climbing in Himalaya ===\nAfter years of stagnation between the wars, British rock climbing underwent a renaissance, particularly with working-class climbing clubs starting up in the north of England and Scotland. The [[Rock and Ice Club]] in [[Manchester]], the Creagh Dhu Mountaineering Club in [[Glasgow]] and several university climbing clubs were amongst those that engendered a highly competitive climbing environment. At [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] in Wales numerous routes of a very high standard were achieved using strictly [[free climbing]] techniques. [[Hamish MacInnes]] and [[Dougal Haston]], although not members, climbed with Creagh Dhu and MacInnes had mentored [[Chris Bonington]]'s youthful climbing as early as 1953.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nIn 1960, Bonington, as a member of a joint British\u2013Indian\u2013Nepalese army team led by [[J. O. M. Roberts|Jimmy Roberts]], reached the summit of the {{convert|26039|ft|adj=on}} [[Annapurna II]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of the range's main summit, Annapurna I. The route did not involve rock climbing.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=347,387}}\n\n[[Mount Everest]] was ascended in 1963 by an American team along [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions#1963|a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=387}}  Two years later, when planning with the American [[John Harlin]] for Harlin's ''direttissima'' attempt on the [[Eigerwand|North Face of the Eiger]], Harlin introduced Bonington to the American [[Big wall climbing|big wall]] technique of directly ascending a [[fixed rope]] using [[Jumar]]s.{{sfnp|Harlin|2008|pp=109\u2013111}} Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and [[Mick Burke (mountaineer)|Mick Burke]] who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=246}} The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the [[Old Man of Hoy]] in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|p=231}} From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen [[Eight-thousander|8000-metre peak]]s climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize.{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}\n\nEncouraged by Roberts, Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing [[Annapurna]] by its South Face which he realised was going to require not just rock climbing but also [[Expedition style|siege climbing tactics]] because the ascent would take many weeks. No one had tried rock climbing at high altitude before. The face itself was almost twice as high as the {{convert|6000|ft}} [[Eigerwand]] and even above the rock band there was another {{convert|3000|ft}} to the summit.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971b|p=18\u201333}}{{sfnp|Bonington|2017|p=155}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2010|pp=189\u2013260}}  The topography near the summit could be assessed from photographs Bonington had taken on the Annapurna II expedition of ten years earlier.{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=411}}\n\n==Expedition planning and departure==\n{{external media|topic=Clip from TV programme|Annapurna|title=Annapurna South Face|headerimage=|caption=\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQE_65nk_p4 Annapurna: The Hardest Way Up]{{sfnp|Edwards|1971}}}}\nWith financial support for the expedition from the [[Mount Everest Foundation]], Bonington assembled a team from amongst his friends: [[Nick Estcourt]], [[Martin Boysen]], [[Ian Clough]], Mike Thompson, Burke and Haston. Advised to include an American to boost sales of the book he was planning, Bonington appointed [[Tom Frost]] who had considerable [[big wall]] experience in [[Yosemite]] as well as \u2013 secretly at the time \u2013 [[Nanda Devi]] on a [[Nanda Devi#CIA mission|CIA mission]] to install a nuclear-powered listening device for monitoring [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese missiles]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}} Frost was known to and respected by Haston and [[Don Whillans]].

A four-man television team from [[ITN]] and [[Thames Television]] was to be accompanying them.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=2\u201313,238\u2013239}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=414}}\n\nThey took {{convert|18000|ft}} of rope for fixing (they did not use their climbing rope), 40 cylinders of Oxygen and six breathing sets.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=246,257}} The baggage was sent from London by sea with Whillans and Lambert flying to [[Bombay]]{{refn|group=note|[[Mumbai]] is the present name.}} to see to its unloading and transport to [[Pokhara]] by lorry. However, the ship was then delayed by about three weeks so Bonington arranged for Whillans and Lambert to travel to [[Kathmandu]] to reconnoitre the approach route instead of waiting at Bombay, and Clough would go to Bombay to deal with the baggage.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29\u201331,39}} They took oxygen cylinders intending to use supplementary oxygen above about {{convert|22500|ft}} but it was very little used for climbing and not at all above Camp VI.

[[Pasang Kami]], the sirdar, treated the sahibs as equals and this was reciprocated. The other Sherpas were Pemba Tharkay, Ang Pema, Mingma Tsering, Nima Tsering and Kancha. As it turned out, a group from the British Army Mountaineering Association, led by [[Henry Day (colonel)|Henry Day]], was setting off at the same time for an ascent on Herzog's north face route and they had greatly helped Bonington by flying out {{convert|1500|lb}} of baggage to supply him until his main baggage arrived.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=390\u2013391}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=29,39,43,238}}{{sfnp|Day|1971|p=89}}\n\nOn 16 March Whillans, Thompson and two Sherpas went ahead of the main parties to reconnoitre the route and to find a suitable place for the base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=38\u201339}} A temporary location was found to be at the entrance to the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]] at the location of a previous base camp: that of the 1957 expedition to [[Machapuchare]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=18,51}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=416}}\nThe slower-moving baggage train of 140 porters set off from Pokhara on 22 March and Clough with his 240 porters was able to leave Bombay with the delayed baggage on 24 March.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=42,53,81}}\n\nBonington and Whillans met up on 27 March and Whillans said he thought he and his Sherpas had seen a [[yeti]] and had photographed the footprints.

Bonington and Burke relocated the lower part of the route hoping to make it suitable for porters.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe ridge they were to use at the start of the climb was straightforwardly approached across the glacier but steep cliff barred the way onto the ridge itself so they skirted these on the right to reach a site for Camp II, lower than hoped for but with nowhere suitable immediately higher. For a short distance the route was seriously threatened by an ice overhang which they called the \"Sword of Damocles\" but they decided to reduce the risk by moving under it as quickly as possible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=73\u201377}}\n\nWhen he arrived with the main baggage Clough was supposed to stop at Hinko Cave overnight on 7 April but, due to confusing instructions, with his entourage of 240 porters he continued on in a snowstorm to temporary base camp some miles further on. Some porters had refused to go beyond Hinko Cave and the rest, overloaded and without adequate clothes and shoes in the bad weather, variously got into states of anger and collapse. However, now the main gear had arrived, it was possible to sort out shelter under cover for the night and provide medical help when necessary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=79\u201381}} On this same day Whillans and Haston had reached the Ice Ridge at a col where Camp III was to be established. They had to climb through deep snow in bad weather. In ten days the expedition had got from the Sanctuary to half height on the face, although with the difficult climbing all to be done further ahead. They [[abseil]]ed down to Camp II from where, next day, they started placing fixed ropes towards the col.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nOn 11 March Boysen and Estcourt established Camp III on the col, where there were to be two Whillans Box tents at a spacious location, free from risk of avalanches or falling rocks.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=85,98}} The version used on Annapurna, designed by Whillans, was [[cuboid]] in shape, {{convert|6.5|x|4.0|x|4|ft}}, made of socketed aluminium tubes covered in nylon top and bottom and cotton-[[terylene]] at the sides. It was strengthened with nylon webbing straps and at one end was a nylon-zipped entrance. An inner nylon tent was available but not always used. It weighed {{convert|30|lb}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison the nylon tents of a hooped design, Bonington calls them RAFMA tents, weighed only {{convert|10|lb}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=251}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=66\u201367,249\u2013250}}\n\nOn 12 April, after Bonington had organised the logistics of getting Base Camp fully set up and equipped, he and Frost set from there so that on 14 April they could start to prospect a route up the Ice Ridge above Camp III. After investigating a snow shelf leading to a gully on the west of the ridge, Bonington decided avalanches posed too great a threat so he joined Frost who was ascending along the actual crest of the ridge. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than they had expected with snow too soft and loose for firm [[piton]] placements and there would be a need to set [[fixed rope]]s all the way up the ridge. Also, they had not formed a plan for placing fixed ropes \u2013 should the lead climber fix his rope or should he climb normally leaving the second climber to pay out a rope from his rucksack, fixing it as he climbed? To begin with the latter method seemed more successful but progress was dreadfully slow with Bonington never having previously encountered such appalling snow.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=86\u201391}} Later in the expedition the technique changed and they climbed using their {{convert|9|mm|adj=on}} fixed rope which they then secured with pitons and [[karabiner]]s, not using their {{convert|11|mm|adj=on}} climbing rope at all.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=247}}\n\nThat night at Camp III they discussed their religious beliefs \u2013 Bonington was a sceptic and Frost a [[Morman]]. Bonington wrote to his wife \"He is a convinced and fervent Mormon, never rams it down your throat, yet his faith has given him a code of conduct that puts him way out in front of most of us\". Next day it was straightforward to re-climb their fixed rope but again onward climbing was extremely difficult. On the previous day and this one Whillans and Haston had been ferrying supplies from Camp II up to Camp III and following their second climb they starting exploring the shelf which Bonington had investigated previously beside the ridge. Here they made such good progress that the pair on the ridge needed little persuasion to abandon  entirely their efforts on the lowest part of the ridge.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=91\u201395}}\n\nNext day all four climbers set off along the shelf with Haston breaking trail and never surrendering the lead. The avalanche risk was considerable even though they kept their distance from the ridge and matters got worse as they reached the gully threatened by avalanches from ice cliffs thousands of feet above and by [[Snow cornice|cornices]] on the ridge itself. They decided to avoid the gully by climbing a minor [[ar\u00eate]] which led from the foot of the gully up to a high point on the main ridge but they had to leave a [[deadman anchor]] when deteriorating weather forced them to retreat to camp. Next day Bonington and Frost got within {{convert|50|ft}} of the crest of the Ice Ridge but again bad weather forced a retreat.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=95\u201399}}\n\nBy 18 April only {{convert|1000|ft}} had been gained since the Col had been reached eleven days earlier and from Base Camp and on 19 April Haston again ascended the minor ar\u00eate where the way to the main ridge was blocked by huge cornices but he found he could slip through gaps in the rotten snow between the wall of the ridge and one of the cornices. However, after reaching the crest of main ridge and fixing a rope he was forced back by the weather. At last, two days later, he was able to reach the Ice Ridge and find an ideal place for Camp IV.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=102\u2013109}} \n\nThe expedition was unexpectedly enhanced when four trekkers \u2013 the Sherpas called them the \"London Sherpas\" \u2013 turned up at Base Camp completely unexpectedly.{{refn|group=note|The trekkers had left [[Essex]] in England in 1969 in a [[Land Rover]], planning to climb in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Delayed in Austria they had spent the winter in Afghanistan and then had driven to Kathmandu, flown to Pokhara, trekked over to the foothills of [[Dhaulagiri]] and crossed to Chomro via the Deroli Pass intending to reach the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=109}} The Deroli Pass, now more usually referred to as the [[Deurali Pass]], is on the [[Annapurna Circuit]] trail, near [[Ghorepani]] and [[Poon Hill]].}} In return for \"board and lodging\" the two men helped carry loads even as high as Camp IV and the women helped at Base Camp where Bonington thought their presence engendered a more a civilised and relaxed air. Other trekkers also turned up to get a grandstand view of the climb and to help carrying loads.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n==Camp IV to Camp V on the Rock Band==\nBoysen, Estcourt, Haston and Whillans worked together establishing Camp IV but the situation at Camp III became critical after several attempts to supply it from Camp II had failed because of deep snow and avalanches. Eventually an overnight carry was successful and in general it seemed the snow conditions improved the higher one got up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=110\u2013114}}\n\nBoysen and Estcourt tackled the upper part of the Ice Ridge above Camp IV which was very narrow with cornices to the left but solid rock on the right. At one point Boysen's progress was blocked except for a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} tunnel which he could clamber through, without his rucksack, as if potholing. The tunnel led not further up the ridge but out onto an ice cliff with a {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} drop to the glacier. However, he managed to climb onto and up the cliff despite the drag of his climbing rope passing along a highly contorted route behind him. When he reached safety he had let out {{convert|150|ft}} of rope in ascending only {{convert|50|ft}}. It was the most difficult ice climb Boysen had ever done. There was no direct way for Estcourt to ascend to Boysen's stance so he had to repeat the circuitous climb. Boysen's next lead again went on to a traverse, which was later called the \"Terrible Traverse\", which he was not able to complete before descending to Camp IV for the night. They had spent all day climbing {{convert|300|ft}}.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=115\u2013119,125}} Next day it again proved impossible to keep to the crest of the ridge but a descent on the right to solid rock gave access to an ice-covered rock wall leading upwards. This climb had to be without the rope being secured with pitons because the rope would have jammed along its contorted route. They regained the ridge again only some {{convert|50|ft}} higher than they had reached the previous day. The following day they extended their route slightly further. After that they had to go down to recover from exhaustion but the fixed ropes they had left allowed everyone following to take a direct line though one that was neither safe nor easy.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=119\u2013121,125}}\n\nBonington and Clough took over the work of extending the route, reaching Camp IV on 27 April. Sometimes they advanced only {{convert|10|ft}} in an hour.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=123\u2013128}} At Whillans' suggestion, they arranged for Sherpas to carry all the climbers'supplies up to Camp III so that when climbers went down to rest they only needed to go to Camp III rather than Base Camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=128}} After a few very difficult days, and without being able to regain the crest of the Ice Ridge at a higher point, Clough went down to be replaced by Haston. On 3 May Whillans, Frost and Burke carried a box tent up to Camp IV while Bonington and Haston with very difficult ice climbing reached a col at {{convert|21650|ft}} where the Ice Ridge terminates to be replaced by a snow slope leading up to the Ice Wall.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=124\u2013141}} Next day they carried a load of ropes to the col and Haston ran out {{convert|500|ft}} of rope towards the Ice Wall. At {{convert|22350|ft}} the slope suddenly changes from 45\u00b0 to vertical and this point was planned to become Camp V{{refn|group=note|The site turned out to be very poor so the camp here was only temporary.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=149}}}} where a {{convert|18|lb|adj=on}} hooped tent was set up, capable of sleeping three. Supplying as high as here was a logistical problem because it took at least five days for anything to arrive from base camp.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141,251}}\n\nSupported by Frost and Burke, Whillans and Haston established Camp V but that night spindrift  inundated the site and the tent so they decided to find a better camp location. Next day they explored the Ice Wall finding a \"gangway\" leading to the top of the Ice Wall and the foot of the Rock Band. At this point the overhang of the [[bergschrund]], although threatening, provided excellent shelter so they proposed moving Camp V to this point. On 9 May Frost and Burke established the camp at the new, higher location.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=141\u2013153}} The climb from Camp IV to V was very long and difficult so two intermediate dumps{{refn|group=note|The lower of the dumps was at the top of the Ice Ridge and the other was at the original site for Camp V at the bottom of the Ice Wall.}} for supplies were used with carrying being done in shorter sections from above and below.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=149\u2013150,154,178}}\n\n==Above Camp V==\n[[File:Tom Frost - South Face of Annapurna - 1970.jpg|thumb|Photograph by Frost: Boysen descending to Camp IV after carrying supplies up to Camp V.]]\nFrost and Burke started on the Rock Band which sloped at about 50\u00b0{{refn|group=note|Bonington likens this to the Second Ice Field on the [[Nordwand|North face of the Eiger]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=160}}}} Instead of taking the most direct line up a groove leading straight upwards, they cut over to the left aiming for the \"Flat Iron\", named after the similar-looking feature on the Eiger, with Burke doing the lead climbing. The good weather helped with the climbing but because of the thaw they were bombarded  from above by falling rocks. The climbers Further down the mountain were having to rest through illness or exhaustion so shortages of rope, oxygen, tents, food and fuel built up towards Camp V. On 12 May Burke and Frost made more progress but only through taking serious risks with inadequate piton placements but when they turned back for the day a storm hit them and their tent was almost buried. Fortunately by that time fresh supplies had arrived from lower camps.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154\u2013172}}\n\nBonington's general plan had been to pair off the leading climbers and to share the work of the pairs equitably by having periods of rest, carrying supplies to higher camps and extending the route. The Sherpas were carrying higher up the mountain than expected and other trekkers with climbing experience had turned up by chance and helped out. However at the higher camps things were not going so well and so on 13 May Bonington decided that when Frost and Burke came down to be rested they would be replaced by Whillans and Haston. In fact it was the turn of Estcourt and Boysen to force the route upwards but they had been working hard doing carrying while Whillans and Haston were rested. Over the radio between various camps some of the adversely affected climbers complained but were accepting it after Bonington agreed for Whillans and Haston to do a single carry before rotating into the lead. Whillans then started criticising Burke and Frost for making very slow progress on the Rock Band and so, to curtail the increasing bitterness, the radio call was ended leaving each pair to plan the detail of their newly assigned roles.{{refn|group=note|Bonington did not think Whillans' criticisms were at all fair. Indeed Burke and Frost has worked hard and made good progress.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=182}}}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=173\u2013180}}\n\nOn their last day in the lead Burke and Frost, possibly goaded by the criticism, managed to fix ropes up all the way to the Flat Iron. Burke had been on the face for 28 days, and Frost only slightly less \u2013 Bonington thought Burke's climb had been on the most exacting rock of the entire expedition. When Frost met Bonington down at Camp II he firmly told him he thought the stab in the back of Estcourt and Boysen had wrecked the morale of the expedition \u2013 all the same he maintained his close relationship with Bonington.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=180\u2013184}}\n\nOn 17 May Boysen, Whillans and Haston carried equipment to the top of the Flat Iron to a suitable site for Camp VI but on the way Boysen had to return to camp to recover. Whillans and Haston found a site for Camp VI but that night at Camp V the ridge tent was crushed with an avalanche of snow so Estcourt and Haston went down to the upper dump to collect the one intended for Camp VII and to get more food. Climbing back to Camp VI on 19 May, Haston's rucksack, containing his personal gear and food for Camp VI, fell down the mountain. So, that night, Whillans was alone at Camp VII with no food after the others had descended. Estcourt was alone at Camp V and so Bonington went up there to help him support the lead team. The climb from there to Camp VI was even more tiring and Bonington scarcely managed the {convert|200|ft|adj=on}} [[jumar]] climb near the top. However, he managed and even took the time on his way down to relocate the dangling rope and place further [[piton]]s on this [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] of the climb. As for oxygen, there were only three bottles at Camp V and another three at the upper dump. There was hardly any food or rope at Camp VI.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=154,185\u2013195}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=205\u2013209}} \n\nOn 20 May Haston returned to Camp VI where Whillans had been without food for over twenty-four hours. Bonington carried up there more food and a radio but had to dump the rope slightly below the camp. Camp VI was a terrible place \u2013 the tent was too large to fit on the ledge so Whillans and Haston had to sleep lying across the width of the tent. Also, the wind was severe and it was only held by two tent pegs, a rope over the top, and the weight of the climbers.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=209\u2013209}} The same day Estcourt carried the oxygen bottles up to Camp V from the upper dump and the lead climbers climbed {{convert|400|ft}} up from Camp VI but they were then out of food and rope and had no tent to pitch for Camp VII which they intended to place at the top of the Rock Band. They heard news that the army team on the other side of the mountain had reached the summit using a similar route to that of the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|French expedition in 1950]].{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\nOn 22 May Bonington and Estcourt headed up with supplies and oxygen cylinders towards Camp VI but Estcourt had to retreat back and Bonington, who was using supplementary oxygen, had to abandon the tent and oxygen ''en route''. Haston and Whillans had reached the top of the \"mini rock band\" at the top of the Rock Band but, with no rope left, they had needed to climb without protection, leaving only about {{convert|1500|ft}} to the summit, they estimated.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=200\u2013202}} They had reached the {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} snowfield above the Rock Band but without a tent or food. Next day Bonington carried tent, cin\u00e9 camera and food up from V to VI but he had needed to abandon his personal gear so he had to turn down an offer to join then on a summit attempt, Bonington and so had to go down again but the tent could be carried up next day to be left on the snow field above Camp VI. On 23 May with insufficient rope and no tent for Camp VII, the lead climbers took a rest day.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=212\u2013216,224}}\n\nIn terrible conditions on 24 May Bonington and Clough managed a carry to Camp VI but found Haston and Whillans had been forced back there so all four climbers had to spend the night together in the two-man tent. Bonington and Clough got back to Camp IV but once there the weather became impossible.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\n==Summit==\nFor the next two days the entire mountain was snowbound and it seemed the monsoon had arrived but on 27 May 1970 at Camp VI there was an improvement in the weather. Leaving Camp VI about 07:00, without supplementary oxygen because they had none, Whillans and Haston reached the snow field at 11:00 from where they could see the summit through breaks in the cloud. They agreed to move the tent up to establish a camp at a higher location but they really had a more ambitious goal for the day. Indeed, any camp would be entirely lacking food or sleeping bags. They were faced with an ice plateau leading to a snow ridge and then an {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} cliff of mixed ice and rock rising up to the top of the mountain. They abandoned the tent at the foot of the ridge and climbed on without [[belay]]s. Neither climber had any difficulty with breathing.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=202\u2013204}}\n\nThe last fifty feet of the ice cliff was vertical though there were good holds and as they reached the northern side of the mountain the wind dropped. They could see traces of army boot footprints but the flag that had been left a week earlier by the army expedition had blown away. Haston took a cin\u00e9 film of Whillans reaching the summit and then they swapped places. From the top, which they reached at 14:30 and stayed for about 10 minutes, they could see the other two Annapurna summits but nothing more. With no feeling of exhilaration, which they knew would come later. They had {{convert|150|ft}} of rope which, after they had abseiled down, was all there was left on the summit. By 17:00 they had managed the difficult descent to Camp VI.{{sfnp|Haston|1971|pp=216\u2013219}}{{sfnp|Day|2010|p=188}}{{sfnp|Frost|1971|p=232}}{{sfnp|Bonington|1999|p=427}}\n\nLower down the mountain everyone had been completely stormbound but Bonington, having been confined to Camp IV, put in his routine 17:00 radio call asking Haston if they had been able to get out of their camp. Due to static on the radio he did not hear the reply \"Aye, we've just climbed Annapurna\" but this was heard load and clear at Base Camp and the news spread rapidly up the mountain.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|p=204}}{{sfnp|Haston|1971|p=219}}\n\n==Leaving the mountain==\nBurke and Frost wanted to make their own attempt on the summit and, contrary to his better judgement, Bonington agreed subject to the clearing of the camps proceeding at the same time. So on 28 May, Burke and Frost while Whillans and Haston descended, reaching Camp III at midday. Everyone was very excited but were held back by their British formality. Only by evening did Frost and Burke reach Camp VI. On 29 May they made their attempt but Burke had to turn back and Frost, having reached the snowfield, stayed there almost three hours but then, because it was the Lord's will, turned back in ferocious wind.{{sfnp|Bonington|1971a|pp=220\u2013224}}\n\nOn 30 May the mountain was being cleared apace with most of the party reaching Base Camp when Thompson rushed down, calling out in despair.

It aired from September 22, 1987 to May 23, 1995, broadcasting eight seasons and 192 episodes.\n\nWhile never a critical favorite, the series was consistently in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Top 30]] (from 1988 onward) but continues to gain even more popularity in [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated reruns]] and is also aired internationally.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Buddy |title=Everywhere You Look: The Unofficial Guide to Full House|publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=9781329209657|url=https://www.amazon.com/Everywhere-You-Look-Unofficial-Guide/dp/1329209656/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484616755&sr=1-1&keywords=9781329209657|language=English}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Its producer [[Dennis Rinsler|Rinsler]] called the show \"''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' of the 1990s\".<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-23-ca-4995-story.html|title=\u2018Full House\u2019 Not Enough for ABC Pot : Television: The long-running, Top 25 show has fallen out of step, giving way to programmers and advertisers pushing for hip, young viewers.|website=Latimes.com|date=May 23, 1995|author=Daniel Howard Cerone|access-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209201910/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-23-ca-4995-story.html|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> For actor Dave Coulier, the show represented a \"G-rated dysfunctional family\".<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/full-house-1987-1995-vol-53-no-25/|title=Full House: 1987-1995|website=People.com|date=June 26, 2000|access-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209202013/https://people.com/archive/full-house-1987-1995-vol-53-no-25/|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It has also had tie-in merchandise marketed, such as a series of paperback books.\n\nA sequel series, ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'', premiered on [[Netflix]] on February 26, 2016.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAfter the death of his wife Pam, sports anchor Danny Tanner recruits his brother-in-law Jesse, a rock musician; and his best friend since childhood, Joey, who works as a stand-up comedian, to help raise his three young daughters. Over time, the three men, as well as the children, bond and become closer to one another.\n\nIn season two, Danny is reassigned from his duties as sports anchor by his television station to become co-host of a new local breakfast TV show, ''Wake Up, San Francisco'', and is teamed up with [[Nebraska]] native [[List of Full House characters#Rebecca Donaldson Katsopolis|Rebecca Donaldson]]. Jesse and Rebecca (\"Becky\") eventually fall in love and get married in season four.

Saget was not available to appear in the [[television pilot|pilot]] due to his commitment as an on-air contributor to [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Morning Program]]''. The producers instead cast actor [[John Posey (actor)|John Posey]] to play Danny. Posey only appeared in the unaired pilot (which is included on the DVD release of Season 1).\n\nJohn Stamos's character was originally named Jesse Cochran; Stamos reportedly wanted his character to better reflect his Greek heritage, so producers decided to change the character's surname to Katsopolis (beginning with season two).\n\nTo comply with [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]], twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle during tapings. The girls were jointly credited as \"Mary Kate Ashley Olsen\" in seasons two through seven because the producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. The sisters occasionally appeared together in [[dream sequence|fantasy sequences]]. That made ''Full house'' one of the only shows on TV where a baby grew up in front of the cameras, with viewers witnessing all the development stages of the twin actresses.<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/> Bob Saget recalled he would often get complaints from the child actors' moms because he wouldn't watch his language while on stage.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/> Jodie Sweetin was spotted in a guest spot on the show ''[[Valerie (TV series)|Valerie]]''.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/> [[Lori Loughlin]] was hired in 1988 for a six-episode romance plot with \"Uncle Jesse\" but ended up staying until the end of the show.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/>\n\nAll seven of the original cast members remained with the show through its entire eight-year run, with five characters added to the main cast along the way. D.J.'s best friend Kimmy was a recurring character in seasons one through four, who was upgraded to a regular in season five. Rebecca originally appeared for six episodes in season two; producers decided to expand her role and made her a regular the following season. After marrying Jesse, they have twins Nicky and Alex, who make their debut in season five. As babies, the children were played by Daniel and Kevin Renteria, and in season six, the roles of the twins were succeeded by Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit. The last main character added was Steve Hale, who was D.J.'s boyfriend in seasons six and seven. He was played by Scott Weinger.\n\n===Taping===\nThe series was created by [[Jeff Franklin]] and executive produced by Franklin, along with Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. The series was produced by Jeff Franklin Productions and [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], in association with [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] (1987\u20131988), [[Lorimar Television]] (1988\u20131993), and then by [[Warner Bros. Television]] (1993\u20131995) after Lorimar was folded into Warner Bros.'s existing television production division.\n\nAlthough the series was set in [[San Francisco]], the sitcom itself was taped at the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Studios]] in Los Angeles. Outside of certain excerpts in the opening title sequences, including [[Alamo Square Park]]'s [[Painted Ladies]], the only episode to have actually been taped in San Francisco was the first episode of season eight, \"[[Comet's Excellent Adventure]]\". There were also a few episodes which were filmed on-location elsewhere, most notably Hawaii in the season three premiere \"Tanner's Island\", and at [[Walt Disney World resorts|Walt Disney World]] for the two-part sixth-season finale \"The House Meets the Mouse\".\n\nThe series experienced heavy turnover with its writing staff throughout its run. The first season in particular had at least three writing staff changes, with Lenny Ripps (who remained with the show until the early part of the fourth season, by then serving as a creative consultant) and Russell Marcus being the only writers surviving the changes through the entire season. Show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin was the only writer to remain with the series throughout its entire eight-season run (Franklin also wrote and directed several episodes during the first five seasons). [[Marc Warren (TV producer)|Marc Warren]] and [[Dennis Rinsler]] joined the series' writing staff in the second season as producers and remained with the show until its 1995 cancellation; Warren and Rinsler took over as head writers by season five and assumed [[showrunner|showrunning]] duties as executive producers for the sixth season to allow Franklin to focus on ''[[Hangin' With Mr. Cooper]]'' (''Full House'' served as ''Cooper''{{'}}s lead-in when the former aired on Tuesday nights during the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]).\n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's [[Theme music|theme song]], \"Everywhere You Look\", was performed by [[Jesse Frederick]], who co-wrote the song with writing partner Bennett Salvay and series creator Jeff Franklin. Various instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits; the version used during seasons three through eight was also used in the opening credits in some early syndication runs, although the song was almost always truncated to the chorus for broadcast. Seasons one through five used a longer version of the theme song. In [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] airings, the line \"you miss your old familiar friends, but waiting just around the bend\" replaced the lines starting with \"how did I get delivered here, somebody tell me please...\" (after [[ABC Family]] acquired the series in 2003, it became the first television outlet to air the long versions of the theme since the series' ABC run, which were included only in select episodes from the first five seasons, whereas the full version was used in most episodes during those seasons). [[Hallmark Channel]] reruns have used four different cuts of the theme song, including the full version.\n\n===Cross-marketing===\nABC used the show to launch other sitcom hits such as ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Family Matters]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''.<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/>\n\nThe actor [[Dave Coulier]] sold the Mr. Woodchuck puppet he made on the show to the toy store [[Toys \"R\" Us]].<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Full House episodes}}\n''Full House'' originally aired on Fridays from September 1987 to August 1991, which spanned the show's first four seasons, and later became the flagship program of ABC's newly launched [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] block in September 1989. The show was briefly moved to Tuesdays during the 1987\u201388 season and then aired twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays for a few months in order to help the series build an audience. It remained on Fridays permanently for the next three seasons, as the show's ratings increased. ''Full House'' was moved to Tuesdays full-time for season five and remained there until the series ended in 1995. While the show's first season was not very successful, finishing 71st that year, mostly because it was a new series placed in an 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] timeslot (most freshman series start out in protected time slots preceded by successful lead-ins), the show quickly became popular during its second season as it was placed immediately following the established hit show ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'' (which was also produced by Tom Miller and Bob Boyett). From season three onwards, it was ranked among [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]'s Top 30 shows (a ratings increase which allowed the series to move back to Fridays at 8 p.m.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chez.com/fbibler/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1985-1990.html|title=Top Rated Programs \u2013 1985\u20131990|work=chez.com|access-date=November 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204174037/http://www.chez.com/fbibler/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1985-1990.html|archive-date=February 4, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> By the fourth season, the series jumped to the Top 20 and remained there until the seventh season (the series peaked at the top ten during seasons five and six).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1990-1995.html|title=Top Rated Programs \u2013 1990\u20131995|work=chez.com|access-date=January 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125050556/http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1990-1995.html|archive-date=January 25, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, despite the fact the show was still rated in the top 25, ABC announced that it was canceling the show after eight seasons due to the increasing costs of producing the series.

Warner Bros., which holds the rights to ''Full House'' and its associated characters, would not permit others to use their characters and selected who could write books based on the television series. The books are based on the ''Silhouette'' romance novels by [[Mills & Boon]]. ''Full House Michelle #7: Summer Rhapsody'' is a Silhouette Special Edition #75 by [[Nancy John]] and [[Laura O'Neil]] in February 1983.\n\nThe series includes the following:\n*''Full House Stephanie'': These 33 books were written from the [[Narrative mode|point of view]] of the Tanners' middle daughter, Stephanie Tanner. They take place with Stephanie in a different middle school, likely because of a slightly different [[redistricting]] plan compared to the one mentioned in season seven's \"Fast Friends\". She has different best friends as well, Allie Taylor and Darcy Powell. Though these are book creations, she has known Allie since [[kindergarten]], and there are several places in the first five seasons of ''Full House'' where fans think an unnamed [[Extra (actor)|extra]] could be Allie. This series begins with Stephanie being pressured to join a clique called the Flamingos, by completing a series of dares. She almost does the last one, though she is not sure if she wants to before D.J. catches her trying to steal Danny's phone card. Stephanie explains tearfully what was happening, and D.J. helps her to understand what the Flamingos were really up to: they wanted to use the phone card to call their boyfriends. Stephanie and the Flamingos become fierce rivals. ''Hip Hop Til You Drop'', ''Two for One Christmas Fun'', and ''Ten Ways to Wreck a Date'' are the most popular.\n*''Full House Michelle'': These 40 stories are told from Michelle's point of view. The first 27 feature more of her, and the other Tanners', home life than others, though some focus on events at school, whereas the last 14, the \"Michelle and Friends\" series, focuses mostly on Michelle and her classmates. Unlike Stephanie, Michelle goes to the same elementary school but is in a different class. Two stories were translated and published in Japan in February 2007. Super special ''My Best Friend is a Movie Star'' came out in September 1996, and along with  ''The Substitute Teacher'' and ''How to be Cool'' are the most popular.\n*''Full House Sisters'': These 14 books focus on Michelle and Stephanie's friendship and comical situations that occur between them. The sisters often alternate points of view in the story.\n*''Full House: Dear Michelle'': These four books were published several years after the others stopped being produced. They take place with Michelle in the third grade, where she writes an [[advice column]] for her class paper.\n*''Club Stephanie'': 1997\u20132001 revival series with the Sisters series. Sweetin is younger than Nickelodeon's [[Larisa Oleynik]] in ''[[Alex, You're Glowing]]'' and [[Irene Ng]] in ''Hot Rock''.\n\n===Russian adaptation===\nIn 2006, ''Full House'' was one of a group of Warner Brothers properties licensed to Moscow-based network [[STS (TV channel)|STS]] for adaptation to Russian. The show, ''{{interlanguage link|Topsy-Turvy House|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0443\u0432\u044b\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043c|vertical-align=sup}}'' followed the plots of the American version with changes to accommodate cultural differences.

Over time, the three men, as well as the children, bond and become closer to one another.\n\nIn season two, Danny is reassigned from his duties as sports anchor by his television station to become co-host of a new local breakfast TV show, ''Wake Up, San Francisco'', and is teamed up with [[Nebraska]] native [[List of Full House characters#Rebecca Donaldson Katsopolis|Rebecca Donaldson]]. Jesse and Rebecca (\"Becky\") eventually fall in love and get married in season four. In season five, Becky gives birth to twin sons,  Nicholas (\"Nicky\") and Alexander (\"Alex\").\n\n==Main cast==\n{{main|List of Full House and Fuller House characters}}\n* [[John Stamos]] as [[Jesse Katsopolis]]{{refn|The character's surname was changed from \"Cochran\" to \"Katsopolis\" after the first season ended.|group=note}}\n* [[Bob Saget]]  as [[Danny Tanner]]\n*  [[Dave Coulier]]  as [[Joey Gladstone]]\n*  [[Candace Cameron Bure|Candace Cameron]]  as [[List of Full House and Fuller House characters#D.J.

Saget was not available to appear in the [[television pilot|pilot]] due to his commitment as an on-air contributor to [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Morning Program]]''. The producers instead cast actor [[John Posey (actor)|John Posey]] to play Danny. Posey only appeared in the unaired pilot (which is included on the DVD release of Season 1).\n\nJohn Stamos's character was originally named Jesse Cochran; Stamos reportedly wanted his character to better reflect his Greek heritage, so producers decided to change the character's surname to Katsopolis (beginning with season two).\n\nTo comply with [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]], twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle during tapings. The girls were jointly credited as \"Mary Kate Ashley Olsen\" in seasons two through seven because the producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. The sisters occasionally appeared together in [[dream sequence|fantasy sequences]]. That made ''Full house'' one of the only shows on TV where a baby grew up in front of the cameras, with viewers witnessing all the development stages of the twin actresses.<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/> Bob Saget recalled he would often get complaints from the child actors' moms because he wouldn't watch his language while on stage.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/> Jodie Sweetin was spotted in a guest spot on the show ''[[Valerie (TV series)|Valerie]]''.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/> [[Lori Loughlin]] was hired in 1988 for a six-episode romance plot with \"Uncle Jesse\" but ended up staying until the end of the show.<ref name=\"people vol-53-no-25\"/>\n\nAll seven of the original cast members remained with the show through its entire eight-year run, with five characters added to the main cast along the way. D.J.'s best friend Kimmy was a recurring character in seasons one through four, who was upgraded to a regular in season five. Rebecca originally appeared for six episodes in season two; producers decided to expand her role and made her a regular the following season. After marrying Jesse, they have twins Nicky and Alex, who make their debut in season five. As babies, the children were played by Daniel and Kevin Renteria, and in season six, the roles of the twins were succeeded by Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit. The last main character added was Steve Hale, who was D.J.'s boyfriend in seasons six and seven. He was played by Scott Weinger.\n\n===Taping===\nThe series was created by [[Jeff Franklin]] and executive produced by Franklin, along with Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. The series was produced by Jeff Franklin Productions and [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], in association with [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] (1987\u20131988), [[Lorimar Television]] (1988\u20131993), and then by [[Warner Bros. Television]] (1993\u20131995) after Lorimar was folded into Warner Bros.'s existing television production division.\n\nAlthough the series was set in [[San Francisco]], the sitcom itself was taped at the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Studios]] in Los Angeles. Outside of certain excerpts in the opening title sequences, including [[Alamo Square Park]]'s [[Painted Ladies]], the only episode to have actually been taped in San Francisco was the first episode of season eight, \"[[Comet's Excellent Adventure]]\". There were also a few episodes which were filmed on-location elsewhere, most notably Hawaii in the season three premiere \"Tanner's Island\", and at [[Walt Disney World resorts|Walt Disney World]] for the two-part sixth-season finale \"The House Meets the Mouse\".\n\nThe series experienced heavy turnover with its writing staff throughout its run. The first season in particular had at least three writing staff changes, with Lenny Ripps (who remained with the show until the early part of the fourth season, by then serving as a creative consultant) and Russell Marcus being the only writers surviving the changes through the entire season. Show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin was the only writer to remain with the series throughout its entire eight-season run (Franklin also wrote and directed several episodes during the first five seasons). [[Marc Warren (TV producer)|Marc Warren]] and [[Dennis Rinsler]] joined the series' writing staff in the second season as producers and remained with the show until its 1995 cancellation; Warren and Rinsler took over as head writers by season five and assumed [[showrunner|showrunning]] duties as executive producers for the sixth season to allow Franklin to focus on ''[[Hangin' With Mr. Cooper]]'' (''Full House'' served as ''Cooper''{{'}}s lead-in when the former aired on Tuesday nights during the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]).\n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's [[Theme music|theme song]], \"Everywhere You Look\", was performed by [[Jesse Frederick]], who co-wrote the song with writing partner Bennett Salvay and series creator Jeff Franklin. Various instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits; the version used during seasons three through eight was also used in the opening credits in some early syndication runs, although the song was almost always truncated to the chorus for broadcast. Seasons one through five used a longer version of the theme song. In [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] airings, the line \"you miss your old familiar friends, but waiting just around the bend\" replaced the lines starting with \"how did I get delivered here, somebody tell me please...\" (after [[ABC Family]] acquired the series in 2003, it became the first television outlet to air the long versions of the theme since the series' ABC run, which were included only in select episodes from the first five seasons, whereas the full version was used in most episodes during those seasons). [[Hallmark Channel]] reruns have used four different cuts of the theme song, including the full version.\n\n===Cross-marketing===\nABC used the show to launch other sitcom hits such as ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Family Matters]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''.<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/>\n\nThe actor [[Dave Coulier]] sold the Mr. Woodchuck puppet he made on the show to the toy store [[Toys \"R\" Us]].<ref name=\"latimes ca-4995\"/>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Full House episodes}}\n''Full House'' originally aired on Fridays from September 1987 to August 1991, which spanned the show's first four seasons, and later became the flagship program of ABC's newly launched [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] block in September 1989. The show was briefly moved to Tuesdays during the 1987\u201388 season and then aired twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays for a few months in order to help the series build an audience. It remained on Fridays permanently for the next three seasons, as the show's ratings increased. ''Full House'' was moved to Tuesdays full-time for season five and remained there until the series ended in 1995. While the show's first season was not very successful, finishing 71st that year, mostly because it was a new series placed in an 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] timeslot (most freshman series start out in protected time slots preceded by successful lead-ins), the show quickly became popular during its second season as it was placed immediately following the established hit show ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'' (which was also produced by Tom Miller and Bob Boyett). From season three onwards, it was ranked among [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]'s Top 30 shows (a ratings increase which allowed the series to move back to Fridays at 8 p.m.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chez.com/fbibler/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1985-1990.html|title=Top Rated Programs \u2013 1985\u20131990|work=chez.com|access-date=November 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204174037/http://www.chez.com/fbibler/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1985-1990.html|archive-date=February 4, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> By the fourth season, the series jumped to the Top 20 and remained there until the seventh season (the series peaked at the top ten during seasons five and six).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1990-1995.html|title=Top Rated Programs \u2013 1990\u20131995|work=chez.com|access-date=January 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125050556/http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/by_5_yr_period/top_programs_1990-1995.html|archive-date=January 25, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, despite the fact the show was still rated in the top 25, ABC announced that it was canceling the show after eight seasons due to the increasing costs of producing the series.

Warner Bros., which holds the rights to ''Full House'' and its associated characters, would not permit others to use their characters and selected who could write books based on the television series. The books are based on the ''Silhouette'' romance novels by [[Mills & Boon]]. ''Full House Michelle #7: Summer Rhapsody'' is a Silhouette Special Edition #75 by [[Nancy John]] and [[Laura O'Neil]] in February 1983.\n\nThe series includes the following:\n*''Full House Stephanie'': These 33 books were written from the [[Narrative mode|point of view]] of the Tanners' middle daughter, Stephanie Tanner. They take place with Stephanie in a different middle school, likely because of a slightly different [[redistricting]] plan compared to the one mentioned in season seven's \"Fast Friends\". She has different best friends as well, Allie Taylor and Darcy Powell. Though these are book creations, she has known Allie since [[kindergarten]], and there are several places in the first five seasons of ''Full House'' where fans think an unnamed [[Extra (actor)|extra]] could be Allie. This series begins with Stephanie being pressured to join a clique called the Flamingos, by completing a series of dares. She almost does the last one, though she is not sure if she wants to before D.J. catches her trying to steal Danny's phone card. Stephanie explains tearfully what was happening, and D.J. helps her to understand what the Flamingos were really up to: they wanted to use the phone card to call their boyfriends. Stephanie and the Flamingos become fierce rivals. ''Hip Hop Til You Drop'', ''Two for One Christmas Fun'', and ''Ten Ways to Wreck a Date'' are the most popular.\n*''Full House Michelle'': These 40 stories are told from Michelle's point of view. The first 27 feature more of her, and the other Tanners', home life than others, though some focus on events at school, whereas the last 14, the \"Michelle and Friends\" series, focuses mostly on Michelle and her classmates. Unlike Stephanie, Michelle goes to the same elementary school but is in a different class. Two stories were translated and published in Japan in February 2007. Super special ''My Best Friend is a Movie Star'' came out in September 1996, and along with  ''The Substitute Teacher'' and ''How to be Cool'' are the most popular.\n*''Full House Sisters'': These 14 books focus on Michelle and Stephanie's friendship and comical situations that occur between them. The sisters often alternate points of view in the story.\n*''Full House: Dear Michelle'': These four books were published several years after the others stopped being produced. They take place with Michelle in the third grade, where she writes an [[advice column]] for her class paper.\n*''Club Stephanie'': 1997\u20132001 revival series with the Sisters series. Sweetin is younger than Nickelodeon's [[Larisa Oleynik]] in ''[[Alex, You're Glowing]]'' and [[Irene Ng]] in ''Hot Rock''.\n\n===Russian adaptation===\nIn 2006, ''Full House'' was one of a group of Warner Brothers properties licensed to Moscow-based network [[STS (TV channel)|STS]] for adaptation to Russian. The show, ''{{interlanguage link|Topsy-Turvy House|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0443\u0432\u044b\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043c|vertical-align=sup}}'' followed the plots of the American version with changes to accommodate cultural differences.
