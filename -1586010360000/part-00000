There are a number of different combinations of enolizable and nonenolizable carbonyl compounds that form a few different [[Claisen condensation#Types|types]] of Claisen.\n\nThe base used must not interfere with the reaction by undergoing [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] [[nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] or [[nucleophilic addition|addition]] with a carbonyl carbon. For this reason, the conjugate sodium [[alkoxide]] base of the alcohol formed (e.g. [[sodium ethoxide]] if [[ethanol]] is formed) is often used, since the alkoxide is regenerated. In mixed Claisen condensations, a [[non-nucleophilic base]] such as [[lithium diisopropylamide]], or LDA, may be used, since only one compound is enolizable. LDA is not commonly used in the classic Claisen or [[Dieckmann condensation]]s due to enolization of the [[electrophilic]] ester.\n\nThe alkoxy portion of the ester must be a relatively good [[leaving group]]. [[methyl group|Methyl]] and [[ethyl group|ethyl]] esters, which yields [[methoxide]] and ethoxide, respectively, are commonly used.\n\n==Types==\n* The classic Claisen condensation,  a self-condensation between two molecules of a compound containing an enolizable ester.\n:[[Image:claisen ethyl acetate.png|350px]]\n\n* The mixed (or \"crossed\") Claisen condensation, where one enolizable ester or ketone and one nonenolizable ester are used. \n:[[Image:mixed claisen example.png|500px]]\n\n* The [[Dieckmann condensation]], where a molecule with two ester groups reacts [[Intramolecular reaction|intramolecular]]ly, forming a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] \u03b2-keto ester. In this case, the ring formed must not be [[ring strain|strained]], usually a 5- or 6-membered chain or ring.\n:[[Image:dieckmann example.png|500px]]\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Claisen condensation mech.png|850px|center]]\n\nIn the first step of the mechanism, an \u03b1-proton is removed by a strong base, resulting in the formation of an enolate anion, which is made relatively stable by the [[delocalized electron|delocalization]] of electrons. Next, the carbonyl carbon of the (other) ester is nucleophilically attacked by the enolate anion. The alkoxy group is then eliminated (resulting in (re)generation of the alkoxide), and the alkoxide removes the newly formed doubly \u03b1-proton to form a new, highly resonance-stabilized enolate anion. [[Aqueous]] [[acid]] (e.g. [[sulfuric acid]] or [[phosphoric acid]]) is added in the final step to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the enolate and any base still present. The newly formed \u03b2-keto ester or \u03b2-diketone is then isolated. Note that the reaction requires a [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] amount of base as the removal of the doubly \u03b1-proton thermodynamically drives the otherwise [[endergonic]] reaction.

{"title_page": "BBC Radio & Music Production Bristol", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit|for=grammar, tone|date=February 2020}}\n{{Third-party|date=February 2020}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=February 2020}}\n}}\n== BBC Bristol Radio Network Production ==\n\nSince 1934, [[Bristol]] has been the home of radio programs transmitted throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the world via [[BBC World Service]]. '''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSOUL MUSIC has no presenter focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme also won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 which was chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.

The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019 the presenter, and poet, Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech Radio 4 radio festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSOUL MUSIC has no presenter focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme also won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 which was chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.
