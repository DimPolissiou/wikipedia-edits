This hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis: both subsistence strategies could have been in use sequentially, alternating or even simultaneously.\n\nHunting and gathering was presumably the [[subsistence]] strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1.8 million years ago, by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', and from its appearance some 0.2 million years ago by ''[[Archaic humans|Homo sapiens]]''.

This specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools such as fishing nets, hooks, and bone harpoons.<ref>Fagan, B. (1989). ''People of the Earth'', pp. 169\u2013181. Scott, Foresman.</ref> The transition into the subsequent [[Neolithic]] period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices.

Many of them reside in the developing world, either in arid regions or tropical forests. Areas that were formerly available to hunter-gatherers were\u2014and continue to be\u2014encroached upon by the settlements of agriculturalists. In the resulting competition for land use, hunter-gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas. In addition, [[Jared Diamond]] has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods, particularly animal resources.

The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that \"wealthy\" hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.<ref>Smith, Eric Alden, Kim Hill, Frank W.

Therefore, no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member. Other characteristics Lee and DeVore proposed were [[flux]] in territorial boundaries as well as in [[demography|demographic]] composition.\n\nAt the same conference, [[Marshall Sahlins]] presented a paper entitled, \"[[Original affluent society|Notes on the Original Affluent Society]]\", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\", as [[Thomas Hobbes]] had put it in 1651.\nAccording to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more [[leisure]] than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well.

The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that \"wealthy\" hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.<ref>Smith, Eric Alden, Kim Hill, Frank W.
