The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n|align=left\n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n|align=left\n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

Consequently, Sorbonne University won an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of 900 Mio euros with no limit of time. This is the first higher education institution in Paris region to win such an [[Financial endowment|endowment]].

[[History]], [[Geography]], [[Languages]], [[Musicology]], [[Philosophy]] are part of this faculty.\n\n=== Science ===\nThe Faculty of Science of Sorbonne University is a major research institution in France.  It can be considered the successor in direct line to the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris.\n\nIt has more than 125 laboratories, most of them in association with the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS). Some of its most notable institutes and laboratories include the [[Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (Mathematics), [[Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]] (Astrophysics), [[Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6|LIP6]] (Informatics / Computer Science), [http://www.isir.upmc.fr/index.php Institut des syst\u00e8mes intelligents et de robotique] (Robotics), Institut de math\u00e9matiques de Jussieu (foundations of Mathematics, shared with [[Paris Diderot University|University Paris-Diderot]]) and the [[Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel]] (Quantum Physics, shared with [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]).\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe faculty of Medicine is located in two [[teaching hospital]]s, [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital]] and '''H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine''' (the latter itself being the successor to [[Saint-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey]]).\n\n== Law (external teachings) ==\nThere is no Law school as such in Sorbonne University. In 1971, most of the law professors from the [[Paris Law Faculty|Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris]] decided to restructure it as a university, called [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]] (after the two main campuses of the Paris Law Faculty: ''place du Panth\u00e9on'' and ''rue d\u2019Assas'' campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cne-evaluation.fr/WCNE_pdf/Paris2.pdf|title=French National Agency of Evaluation of Higher education institutions, p.65}}</ref>Panth\u00e9on-Assas now provides Law teachings for Sorbonne University as an independent university.\n\n== Campuses ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Paris-Sorbonne.jpg|The Sorbonne\nFile:Paris 75005 Grande Galerie de l'Evolution 20070804.jpg|Perspective view from the [[Jardin des Plantes]]\n\nImage:Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre_Sorbone.JPG|The \"Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre Richelieu\", a [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]'s lecture hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sorbonne ===\n{{See|Sorbonne}}\n'''Sorbonne University''''s historical campus is in the historic central '''Sorbonne''' building, located at 47 rue des \u00c9coles, in the Latin Quarter.

The chapel was built in 1622 by the then-Provisor of the University of Paris, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], during the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. In 1881, politician [[Jules Ferry]] decided to convert the Sorbonne into one single building. Under the supervision of Pierre Greard, Chief Officer of the Education Authority of Paris, Henri-Paul N\u00e9not constructed the current building from 1883 to 1901 that reflects a basic architectural uniformity. The integration of the chapel into the whole was also N\u00e9not's work with the construction of a [[cour d'honneur]]. The Sorbonne building is generally reserved for undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students in certain academic disciplines. Only students in Semitic studies, regardless of level, take all their classes at the Sorbonne campus.\n\nThe Library of the Sorbonne is an inter-university library of the Universities Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne (Paris 1), New Sorbonne (Paris 3), Sorbonne University, Paris Descartes (Paris 5), and Paris Diderot (Paris 7), under the administration of Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr/ biu/spip.php?rubrique294 |title=Convention de la BIS |website=bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr |language=fr}}</ref> It is open exclusively to undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students.

It houses the Faculty of Science. The first buildings are from 1957. The main part of the campus, the \"Gril d'Albert,\" was built in 1964, and was completely refurbished from 1996 to 2016.<ref>[http://focuscampus.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/09/29/le-campus-renove-de-lupmc-ou-lautre-visage-de-luniversite/]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Maison de la Recherche ===\n[[Image:Salle Saint-Jacques (Biblioth\u00e8que de la Sorbonne).jpg|thumb|right|250|Inter-university Library of La Sorbonne]]\nThe Maison de la Recherche campus is the central building for doctoral studies that hosts the history and geography departments. It houses the Serpente Library that has 55,000 works and 292 past and current French and international periodicals. All doctoral dissertations since 1 January 1986 have been stored at the Serpente Library.\n\n=== Clignancourt and Malesherbes ===\nTwo other campuses are the Clignancourt and Malesherbes centers. Undergraduate students in their first and second years of study in Philosophy, History, [[Geography]], English and Spanish take their classes at the Clignancourt center. The Clignancourt Library contains 78,000 works, 210 French and international periodicals and 800 educational DVDs.\n\nUndergraduate students in their first and second years of study in [[French literature]], French language, [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Musicology]] take their classes at the Malesherbes center. All undergraduate students in these academic disciplines study in the central Sorbonne building in their third year. Undergraduate and graduate students in [[German studies]], [[Slavic studies]], [[Italian language|Italic studies]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian studies]], regardless of level, take all of their classes at the Malesherbes center. The Malesherbes center also hosts three research centers in [[Italian culture]], the cultures and literature of central Europe and the Balkans and the Germanic, Nordic and Dutch centers. The Malesherbes Library contains 200,000 works specializing in the study of foreign languages and cultures and 1,200 past and current French and international periodicals. More than 50,000 doctoral dissertations are available for public viewing.\n\n=== Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie ===\nUndergraduate [[Art History]] and [[Archeology]] students take their classes at the Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, located at the main entrance of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. Constructed by architect Paul Bigot between 1925 and 1930, the Mesopotamian-style building was classified as a national historical building in 1996. It hosts the Michelet Library that contains 100,000 volumes of work on art history and archeology with 100 French and international periodicals. Only 10,000 of the art history and archeology works are open to students, the others requiring special authorization of usage. Graduate Art History and Archeology students take their courses at the Institut National de l'Histoire de l'Art in the Galerie Colbert, a partnered national institution of the University.\n\n=== Other campuses in Paris ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}\nBoth the Institut d'Urbanisme et d'Am\u00e9nagement and the Institut d'Etudes hispanique in the Latin Quarter host third year and graduate students of [[Geography]] and Iberian and Latin American studies. The Marcel Bataillon Library houses the Institut d'Etudes hispaniques' collection of 25,000 works on Iberian and Latin-American culture. Catalan studies take place at the Centre d'Etudes catalanes in the Marais.\n\nThere are also Campus Piti\u00e9 and Campus Saint-Antoine for medicine ; Campus Les Cordeliers, Campus Curie and Campus Raspail for sciences.\n\n=== Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi ===\n{{main|Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi}}\nAn exclusive international agreement between Paris-Sorbonne and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] was signed on 19 February 2006, starting plans to bring Paris-Sorbonne University to Abu Dhabi. The Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (PSUAD) was established on 30 May 2008 on Reem Island by a decree of the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. All programs are taught in the French language except for the Bachelor of Physics which is taught in English and the Masters programs. An intensive French language programme is offered for one or two year(s) to students who do not meet the French language requirement for registration. The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education, having also signed a contract with the [[Louvre]] in 2007 to create the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], and with [[New York University]] in 2007 to create [[New York University Abu Dhabi]]. PSUAD is jointly governed by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and by PSUAD's board of six members, three of whom are appointed by the home Paris-Sorbonne University, the other three appointed by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. The President of PSUAD and Chairman of the Board is the President of the home Paris-Sorbonne University, currently Georges Molini\u00e9. Academic programs are offered at the undergraduate level only in the social sciences, humanities and fine arts.\n\n==Academic==\nMembers have worked on several projects in order to strengthen the relations between them and potentially create a new international institution. The most famous projects are the \"Sorbonne College\" (Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne) for bachelor's degree teaching and the \"Sorbonne Doctoral College\" (Coll\u00e8ge doctoral de la Sorbonne) for PhD candidates.\n\n===The Sorbonne College===\nSince 2014, the Sorbonne College for bachelor's degree (\u00ab Coll\u00e8ge des Licences de la Sorbonne \u00bb) has been coordinating the academic projects inside Sorbonne University and with Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, the law school of the Sorbonne University Group which has not merged into the Sorbonne University and remained independent. It also offers cross-institutional academic courses in many fields, allowing students to graduate from both institutions.

The chapel was built in 1622 by the then-Provisor of the University of Paris, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], during the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. In 1881, politician [[Jules Ferry]] decided to convert the Sorbonne into one single building. Under the supervision of Pierre Greard, Chief Officer of the Education Authority of Paris, Henri-Paul N\u00e9not constructed the current building from 1883 to 1901 that reflects a basic architectural uniformity. The integration of the chapel into the whole was also N\u00e9not's work with the construction of a [[cour d'honneur]]. The Sorbonne building is generally reserved for undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students in certain academic disciplines. Only students in Semitic studies, regardless of level, take all their classes at the Sorbonne campus.\n\nThe Library of the Sorbonne is an inter-university library of the Universities Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne (Paris 1), New Sorbonne (Paris 3), Sorbonne University, Paris Descartes (Paris 5), and Paris Diderot (Paris 7), under the administration of Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr/ biu/spip.php?rubrique294 |title=Convention de la BIS |website=bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr |language=fr}}</ref> It is open exclusively to undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students.

It houses the Faculty of Science. The first buildings are from 1957. The main part of the campus, the \u201cGril d'Albert,\u201d was built in 1964, and was completely refurbished from 1996 to 2016.<ref>[http://focuscampus.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/09/29/le-campus-renove-de-lupmc-ou-lautre-visage-de-luniversite/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Maison de la Recherche ===\n[[Image:Salle Saint-Jacques (Biblioth\u00e8que de la Sorbonne).jpg|thumb|right|250|Inter-university Library of La Sorbonne]]\nThe Maison de la Recherche campus is the central building for doctoral studies that hosts the history and geography departments. It houses the Serpente Library that has 55,000 works and 292 past and current French and international periodicals. All doctoral dissertations since 1 January 1986 have been stored at the Serpente Library.\n\n=== Clignancourt and Malesherbes ===\nTwo other campuses are the Clignancourt and Malesherbes centers. Undergraduate students in their first and second years of study in Philosophy, History, [[Geography]], English and Spanish take their classes at the Clignancourt center. The Clignancourt Library contains 78,000 works, 210 French and international periodicals and 800 educational DVDs.\n\nUndergraduate students in their first and second years of study in [[French literature]], French language, [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Musicology]] take their classes at the Malesherbes center. All undergraduate students in these academic disciplines study in the central Sorbonne building in their third year. Undergraduate and graduate students in [[German studies]], [[Slavic studies]], [[Italian language|Italic studies]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian studies]], regardless of level, take all of their classes at the Malesherbes center. The Malesherbes center also hosts three research centers in [[Italian culture]], the cultures and literature of central Europe and the Balkans and the Germanic, Nordic and Dutch centers. The Malesherbes Library contains 200,000 works specializing in the study of foreign languages and cultures and 1,200 past and current French and international periodicals. More than 50,000 doctoral dissertations are available for public viewing.\n\n=== Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie ===\nUndergraduate [[Art History]] and [[Archeology]] students take their classes at the Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, located at the main entrance of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. Constructed by architect Paul Bigot between 1925 and 1930, the Mesopotamian-style building was classified as a national historical building in 1996. It hosts the Michelet Library that contains 100,000 volumes of work on art history and archeology with 100 French and international periodicals. Only 10,000 of the art history and archeology works are open to students, the others requiring special authorization of usage. Graduate Art History and Archeology students take their courses at the Institut National de l'Histoire de l'Art in the Galerie Colbert, a partnered national institution of the University.\n\n=== Other campuses in Paris ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}\nBoth the Institut d'Urbanisme et d'Am\u00e9nagement and the Institut d'Etudes hispanique in the Latin Quarter host third year and graduate students of [[Geography]] and Iberian and Latin American studies. The Marcel Bataillon Library houses the Institut d'Etudes hispaniques' collection of 25,000 works on Iberian and Latin-American culture. Catalan studies take place at the Centre d'Etudes catalanes in the Marais.\n\nThere are also Campus Piti\u00e9 and Campus Saint-Antoine for medicine ; Campus Les Cordeliers, Campus Curie and Campus Raspail for sciences.\n\n=== Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi ===\n{{main|Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi}}\nAn exclusive international agreement between Paris-Sorbonne and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] was signed on 19 February 2006, starting plans to bring Paris-Sorbonne University to Abu Dhabi. The Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (PSUAD) was established on 30 May 2008 on Reem Island by a decree of the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. All programs are taught in the French language except for the Bachelor of Physics which is taught in English and the Masters programs. An intensive French language programme is offered for one or two year(s) to students who do not meet the French language requirement for registration. The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education, having also signed a contract with the [[Louvre]] in 2007 to create the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], and with [[New York University]] in 2007 to create [[New York University Abu Dhabi]]. PSUAD is jointly governed by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and by PSUAD's board of six members, three of whom are appointed by the home Paris-Sorbonne University, the other three appointed by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. The President of PSUAD and Chairman of the Board is the President of the home Paris-Sorbonne University, currently Georges Molini\u00e9. Academic programs are offered at the undergraduate level only in the social sciences, humanities and fine arts.\n\n==Academic==\nMembers have worked on several projects in order to strengthen the relations between them and potentially create a new international institution. The most famous projects are the \"Sorbonne College\" (Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne) for bachelor's degree teaching and the \"Sorbonne Doctoral College\" (Coll\u00e8ge doctoral de la Sorbonne) for PhD candidates.\n\n===The Sorbonne College===\nSince 2014, the Sorbonne College for bachelor's degree (\u00ab Coll\u00e8ge des Licences de la Sorbonne \u00bb) has been coordinating the academic projects inside Sorbonne University and with Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, the law school of the Sorbonne University Group which has not merged into the Sorbonne University and remained independent. It also offers cross-institutional academic courses in many fields, allowing students to graduate from both institutions. For example, some cross-institutional bachelor's degrees (\u00ab double licences \u00bb) are proposed to students in :\n*Science and History (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Musicology (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Philosophy (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Chinese (Sorbonne)\n*Science and German (Sorbonne)\n*Law and History (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*Law and Art History (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*Law and Science (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*History and Media (Sorbonne / Panth\u00e9on-Assas)<ref>{{cite web|website=\u00c9l\u00e9ad|title=Les cursus s\u00e9lectifs des grandes universit\u00e9s parisiennes, les doubles licences|url=http://elead.fr/cursus-selectifs-grandes-universites-parisiennes/|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nAs it is the case in the Anglo-American university system, Sorbonne University proposes a major-minor system, that is currently being deployed at the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orientation.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/05/21/la-sorbonne-universite-delite-et-de-masse-entretien-avec-barthelemy-jobert-president-de-luniversite-paris-sorbonne/|title=\" La Sorbonne, universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lite et de masse: entretien avec Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Jobert, pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019universit\u00e9 Paris Sorbonne \", Le Monde.fr}}</ref>\n\nSorbonne University, in partnership with INSEAD, also offers all of its alumni and PhD students a professionalizing course in business management to complete their curriculum.\n\n===The Doctoral College===\n[[File:Docteurs-SorbonneUniversit\u00e9s-15.jpg|thumb|Sorbonne University's graduation ceremony, May 2011]]\nSince 2010, every PhD student is being delivered an honorary diploma labeled Sorbonne University.

It operated between November 8-12, 1954 at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) with a maximum sustained power of 2.5 [[megawatts]] (MW), and generated a total of 96 MW-hours of energy<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>. \n\nThe ARE was the first reactor to use circulating [[molten salt]] fuel. The hundreds of engineers and scientists working on ARE provided technical data, facilities, equipment, and experience that enabled the broader development of [[molten salt reactors]] as well as [[Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor |liquid metal cooled reactors ]]. \n\n== Background ==\nThe concept of nuclear-powered aircraft was first formally studied in May 1946 by the [[US Army Air Forces]].<ref name=\"nuclearflight\">{{cite book |last1=Gantz |first1=Kenneth |title=Nuclear flight; the United States Air Force programs for atomic jets, missiles, and rockets. |date=1960 |publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce |location=New York |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001555146&view=1up&seq=16 |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> It was supposed that the unique characteristics of nuclear power could be applied to long-range supersonic flight, which was considered highly valuable in terms of military strategy. Challenges in the proposal were understood immediately, and by 1950 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] joined with the Air Force to study the possibilities via technology development in the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program.\n\nThe ORNL staff of the ANP project decided that technical information and experience needed to support the objective of nuclear-powered flight could most economically be obtained from building and operating the ARE. They considered the task of flying a supersonic airplane on nuclear energy exceedingly complex, and thought more than one experimental reactor may be necessary before sufficient information was obtained to design and construct a reactor for flight. \n\nOriginally, the ARE was conceived as a liquid [[sodium]] metal-cooled [[Beryllium oxide]] (BeO)-moderated solid-fuel reactor. The BeO moderator blocks were purchased with the solid-fuel design in mind. However, concerns regarding [[Nuclear_chain_reaction|chain reaction]] stability related to [[xenon]] in solid fuel at very high temperatures were serious enough to warrant abandoning solid fuel and replacing it with circulating fluid fuel. A fluid-fueled option with molten fluoride salt was worked into the original design.<ref name=\"bettis57\">{{cite journal |last1=Bettis |first1=E.S. |last2=Schroeder |first2=R.W. |last3=Cristy |first3=G.A. |title=The Aircraft Reactor Experiment\u2014Design and Construction |journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering |date=1957 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=804\u2013825 |doi=10.13182/NSE57-A35495 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactor ==\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram.png|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment cross section.png|thumb|A cross-section of the fluid-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment, an experimental nuclear reactor that operated in 1954]]\n\nThe ARE was designed to be a prototype of a 350-megawatt, BeO-moderated, circulating-fuel aircraft reactor. It used a fuel composed of 53.09 mole % NaF, 40.73 mole % ZrF<sub>4</sub>, and 6.18 mole % UF<sub>4</sub>. The reactor was a BeO cylinder with bent tubes directing flowing fuel through the core in both directions. It was surrounded by an [[Inconel]] shell. <ref name=\"ornl1234\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell, Editor |first1=W.

The design fuel temperature was 1500\u00b0F (816\u00b0C), with a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) temperature rise across the core, though the peak temperature reached 1580\u00b0F (860\u00b0C) in steady operation and peaked at 1620\u00b0F (882\u00b0C) in transients. 46 gallons of fuel flowed through the reactor per minute at a core pressure of about 40 psig (2.76 bar). Sodium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 150 gallons (568l) per minute with about 50 psig (3.45 bar) of pressure.<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>\n\nThe fuel salt transferred heat to a [[helium]] loop, which then transferred the heat to water. Additionally, the reflector and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] blocks were cooled with a liquid sodium metal cooling loop, which also transferred heat to helium and then water. \n\nThe reactor contained one [[Startup neutron source|neutron source]] (15 [[Curie|Curies]] of Polonium-Beryllium), 1 regulating rod, and 3 helium-cooled [[boron carbide]] shim rods. The experiment was instrumented with 2 [[fission chambers]], 2 compensated [[ionization chamber|ionization chambers]], and 800 [[thermocouples]]. \n\nThe ARE control system could automatically [[scram]] the reactor based on high [[neutron flux]], fast [[Inhour equation|reactor period]], high reactor exit fuel temperature, low heat exchanger fuel temperature, low fuel flow rate, and loss of offsite power.\n\n== Development Program ==\n[[File:Natural-convection corrosion test loops.jpg|thumb|Natural-convection corrosion test loops used during the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project to down-select workable fuel/material combinations]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup with clear tubes.

[[natural convection|Natural-convection]] [[corrosion]] test loops were operated to down-select suitable material and fuel combinations. Subsequent studies in forced-circulation test loops established means to minimize corrosion and [[mass transfer]].\n\nDevelopment of pumps, [[heat exchangers]], [[valves]], [[Pressure_sensor|pressure instrumentation]], and [[cold trap|cold traps]] spanned from late 1951 to summer 1954. Much of the work was based on extensive experience at lower temperature from [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]]. \n\nTechniques had to be developed concerning the construction, preheating, instrumentation, and insulation of reliable leak-tight high-temperature circuits made of [[Inconel]]. They found that all-welded construction was necessary. \n\nIn all, equipment development in support of high-temperature leak-tight operation lasted about 4 years. <ref name=\"components\">{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=H.W. |title=Components of the fused-salt and sodium circuits of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1958-09-18 |issue=ORNL-2348 |osti=4308571 }}</ref>\n\nThe ARE Hazard Summary Report<ref name=\"hazards\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT HAZARDS SUMMARY REPORT |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1952-11-24 |issue=ORNL-1407 |osti=4704625 }}</ref> was issued on November 24, 1952. \n\nA low-temperature critical mockup of the reactor was assembled to verify the calculation models.

It became critical with a mass of 32.8 lbs (14.9kg) [[Uranium-235]]. It was very stable as a result of its strong negative [[Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity|fuel temperature coefficient]] (measured at -9.8e-5 dk/k/\u00b0F). \n\nThe assembly was first sufficiently assembled on August 1, 1954, at which point a three-shift operation commenced for tests. Hot sodium metal was flowed through the system beginning on September 26 to test the process equipment and instrumentation. Problems with the sodium vent and sodium purification systems required lengthy repairs. After several sodium dumps and recharges, carrier salt was introduced to the system on October 25th. Fuel was first added to the reactor on October 30, 1954. Initial [[Criticality_(status)|criticality]] was reached at 3:45 P.M. on November 3, after a painstaking and careful process of adding the [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] fuel. Much of the 4 days was spent removing plugs and repairing leaks in the enrichment line. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality]]\n\nA series of fuel samples were taken periodically. Most notably, they showed an increase in [[Chromium]] content at a rate of 50 ppm/day, indicating rapid corrosion of the fuel pipes. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Typical Control Rod Scene.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Control Rod Scene during operation: examining charts during rod calibration experiments]]\n\nA series of experiments were performed in the ARE supporting its mission<ref name=\"ornl1845\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=Operation of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1955-09-06 |issue=ORNL-1845 |osti=4237975 }}</ref>.\n\n* Critical experiment\n* Subcritical measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Power determination at 1 Watt (nominal)\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. fuel addition\n* Fuel system characteristics\n* Power determination at 10 Watts\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. reactor period\n* Calibration of shim rod vs. regulating rod\n* Effect of fuel flow on reactivity\n* Low-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Adjustment of chamber position\n* Approach to power: 10-kW run\n* Test of off-gas system\n* Approach to power: 100-kW to 1-MW runs\n* High-power measurement of the fuel temperature coefficient\n* High-power measurement of the reactor temperature coefficient\n* Reactor startup on temperature coefficient\n* Sodium temperature coefficient\n* Effect of a dollar of reactivity\n* High-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Moderator temperature coefficient\n* Xenon run at full power\n* Reactivity effects of sodium flow\n* Xenon buildup at one-tenth full power\n* Operation at maximum power\n\nAt 4:19 P.M. on November 8, during the ascent to high power, the reactor was shut down due to high airborne radioactivity measurements in the basement. It appeared that the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking [[Nuclear_fission_product|fission-product]] gases and vapors into the pits, and the pits were leaking into the basement through defective seals in some electrical junction panels. A 2-in. pipeline was run from the pits 1000 ft. (305m) south into an uninhabited valley. Portable [[compressors]] and a jet were used to bring the pits to sub-atmospheric pressure for the rest of the experiment. The safety radiation detectors shut down the reactor a few times during restart and were withdrawn to be further away from the reactor. Eventually, the reactor started back up and reached high power. \n\nOn November 12, operation of the reactor was demonstrated to Air Force and ANP personnel who had gathered at ORNL for a quarterly information meeting. [[Load following power plant|Load following]] was demonstrated by turning the blowers on and off. With all operational objectives attained, the decision to cease operation was made. Colonel Clyde D. Gasser was visiting the lab at this time and was invited to officiate the termination of the experiment. At 8:04 P.M., he scrammed the reactor for the last time. \n\n[[File:Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.jpg|thumb|Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

On November 13th, the fuel was transferred to the fuel dump tank. Pressurized carrier salt flushed the pipes and diluted the dump tank. Flush salt was heated to 100\u00b0F above the system temperature and pumped through the fuel channels. Operators observed the thermocouples to ensure flush salt flowed in all channels. \n\nAfter the fuel dump, the operating personnel had to evacuate the building for 1 hour after gas from the fuel purge operation which had been discharged out the stack descended and entered the ventilators on the building roof. The sodium system was drained without incident. \n\nTwo flat 6 ft. by 4 ft. [[Lead_shielding|lead shields]] with 2 inch thickness were suspended in the heat exchanger cell to protect decommissioning personnel from radiation from the fuel systems. \n\nWater lines were cut first. Then, sodium lines were cut with hack saws and immediately sealed with several layers of masking tape. The sodium pump was cleaned and the impeller was removed for examination. When the sodium pump and heat exchanger were removed, the radiation field in the room increased to 600 [[Roentgen_equivalent_man|mrem]]/hr. The equipment had been shielding the area from the fuel system radiation.\n\nThe fuel system was carefully dismantled starting in February, 1955. The main fuel pump bowl surveyed at 900 mrem/hr at 5 ft. A portable grinder that could be operated from within a lead box was built to cut the fuel lines near the reactor can. Once it was free, the reactor was moved to storage and later to a burial ground. The fuel in the dump tank was slated to be reprocessed.\n\nAbout 60 samples of equipment and material were taken for detailed analysis and examination.

It operated between November 8-12, 1954 at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) with a maximum sustained power of 2.5 [[megawatts]] (MW), and generated a total of 96 MW-hours of energy<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>. \n\nThe ARE was the first reactor to use circulating [[molten salt]] fuel. The hundreds of engineers and scientists working on ARE provided technical data, facilities, equipment, and experience that enabled to the broader development of [[molten salt reactors]] as well as [[Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor |liquid metal cooled reactors ]]. \n\n== Background ==\nThe concept of nuclear-powered aircraft was first formally studied in May 1946 by the [[US Army Air Forces]].<ref name=\"nuclearflight\">{{cite book |last1=Gantz |first1=Kenneth |title=Nuclear flight; the United States Air Force programs for atomic jets, missiles, and rockets. |date=1960 |publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce |location=New York |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001555146&view=1up&seq=16 |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> It was supposed that the unique characteristics of nuclear power could be applied to long-range supersonic flight, which was considered highly valuable in terms of military strategy. Challenges in the proposal were understood immediately, and by 1950 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] joined with the Air Force to study the possibilities via technology development in the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program.\n\nThe ORNL staff of the ANP project decided that technical information and experience needed to support the objective of nuclear-powered flight could most economically be obtained from building and operating the ARE. They considered the task of flying a supersonic airplane on nuclear energy exceedingly complex, and thought more than one experimental reactor may be necessary before sufficient information was obtained to design and construct a reactor for flight. \n\nOriginally, the ARE was conceived as a liquid [[sodium]] metal-cooled [[Beryllium oxide]] (BeO)-moderated solid-fuel reactor. The BeO moderator blocks were purchased with the solid-fuel design in mind. However, concerns regarding [[Nuclear_chain_reaction|chain reaction]] stability related to [[xenon]] in solid fuel at very high temperatures were serious enough to warrant abandoning solid fuel and replacing it with circulating fluid fuel. A fluid-fueled option with molten fluoride salt was worked into the original design.<ref name=\"bettis57\">{{cite journal |last1=Bettis |first1=E.S. |last2=Schroeder |first2=R.W. |last3=Cristy |first3=G.A. |title=The Aircraft Reactor Experiment\u2014Design and Construction |journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering |date=1957 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=804\u2013825 |doi=10.13182/NSE57-A35495 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactor ==\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram.png|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment cross section.png|thumb|A cross-section of the fluid-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment, an experimental nuclear reactor that operated in 1954]]\n\nThe ARE was designed to be a prototype of a 350-megawatt, BeO-moderated, circulating-fuel aircraft reactor. It used a fuel composed of 53.09 mole % NaF, 40.73 mole % ZrF<sub>4</sub>, and 6.18 mole % UF<sub>4</sub>. The reactor was a BeO cylinder with bent tubes directing flowing fuel through the core in both directions. It was surrounded by an [[Inconel]] shell. <ref name=\"ornl1234\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell, Editor |first1=W.

The design fuel temperature was 1500\u00b0F (816\u00b0C), with a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) temperature rise across the core, though the peak temperature reached 1580\u00b0F (860\u00b0C) in steady operation and peaked at 1620\u00b0F (882\u00b0C) in transients. 46 gallons of fuel flowed through the reactor per minute at a core pressure of about 40 psig (2.76 bar). Sodium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 150 gallons (568l) per minute with about 50 psig (3.45 bar) of pressure.<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>\n\nThe fuel salt transferred heat to a [[helium]] loop, which then transferred the heat to water. Additionally, the reflector and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] blocks were cooled with a liquid sodium metal cooling loop, which also transferred heat to helium and then water. \n\nThe reactor contained one [[Startup neutron source|neutron source]] (15 [[Curie|Curies]] of Polonium-Beryllium), 1 regulating rod, and 3 helium-cooled [[boron carbide]] shim rods. The experiment was instrumented with 2 [[fission chambers]], 2 compensated [[ionization chamber|ionization chambers]], and 800 [[thermocouples]]. \n\nThe ARE control system could automatically [[scram]] the reactor based on high [[neutron flux]], fast [[Inhour equation|reactor period]], high reactor exit fuel temperature, low heat exchanger fuel temperature, low fuel flow rate, and loss of offsite power.\n\n== Development Program ==\n[[File:Natural-convection corrosion test loops.jpg|thumb|Natural-convection corrosion test loops used during the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project to down-select workable fuel/material combinations]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup with clear tubes.

[[natural convection|Natural-convection]] [[corrosion]] test loops were operated to down-select suitable material and fuel combinations. Subsequent studies in forced-circulation test loops established means to minimize corrosion and [[mass transfer]].\n\nDevelopment of pumps, [[heat exchangers]], [[valves]], [[Pressure_sensor|pressure instrumentation]], and [[cold trap|cold traps]] spanned from late 1951 to summer 1954. Much of the work was based on extensive experience at lower temperature from [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]]. \n\nTechniques had to be developed concerning the construction, preheating, instrumentation, and insulation of reliable leak-tight high-temperature circuits made of [[Inconel]]. They found that all-welded construction was necessary. \n\nIn all, equipment development in support of high-temperature leak-tight operation lasted about 4 years. <ref name=\"components\">{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=H.W. |title=Components of the fused-salt and sodium circuits of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1958-09-18 |issue=ORNL-2348 |osti=4308571 }}</ref>\n\nThe ARE Hazard Summary Report<ref name=\"hazards\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT HAZARDS SUMMARY REPORT |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1952-11-24 |issue=ORNL-1407 |osti=4704625 }}</ref> was issued on November 24, 1952. \n\nA low-temperature critical mockup of the reactor was assembled to verify the calculation models.

It became critical with a mass of 32.8 lbs (14.9kg) [[Uranium-235]]. It was very stable as a result of its strong negative [[Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity|fuel temperature coefficient]] (measured at -9.8e-5 dk/k/\u00b0F). \n\nThe assembly was first sufficiently assembled on August 1, 1954, at which point a three-shift operation commenced for tests. Hot sodium metal was flowed through the system beginning on September 26 to test the process equipment and instrumentation. Problems with the sodium vent and sodium purification systems required lengthy repairs. After several sodium dumps and recharges, carrier salt was introduced to the system on October 25th. Fuel was first added to the reactor on October 30, 1954. Initial [[Criticality_(status)|criticality]] was reached at 3:45 P.M. on November 3, after a painstaking and careful process of adding the [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] fuel. Much of the 4 days was spent removing plugs and repairing leaks in the enrichment line. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality]]\n\nA series of fuel samples were taken periodically. Most notably, they showed an increase in [[Chromium]] content at a rate of 50 ppm/day, indicating rapid corrosion of the fuel pipes. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Typical Control Rod Scene.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Control Rod Scene during operation: examining charts during rod calibration experiments]]\n\nA series of experiments were performed in the ARE supporting its mission<ref name=\"ornl1845\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=Operation of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1955-09-06 |issue=ORNL-1845 |osti=4237975 }}</ref>.\n\n* Critical experiment\n* Subcritical measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Power determination at 1 Watt (nominal)\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. fuel addition\n* Fuel system characteristics\n* Power determination at 10 Watts\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. reactor period\n* Calibration of shim rod vs. regulating rod\n* Effect of fuel flow on reactivity\n* Low-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Adjustment of chamber position\n* Approach to power: 10-kW run\n* Test of off-gas system\n* Approach to power: 100-kW to 1-MW runs\n* High-power measurement of the fuel temperature coefficient\n* High-power measurement of the reactor temperature coefficient\n* Reactor startup on temperature coefficient\n* Sodium temperature coefficient\n* Effect of a dollar of reactivity\n* High-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Moderator temperature coefficient\n* Xenon run at full power\n* Reactivity effects of sodium flow\n* Xenon buildup at one-tenth full power\n* Operation at maximum power\n\nAt 4:19 P.M. on November 8, during the ascent to high power, the reactor was shut down due to high airborne radioactivity measurements in the basement. It appeared that the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking [[Nuclear_fission_product|fission-product]] gases and vapors into the pits, and the pits were leaking into the basement through defective seals in some electrical junction panels. A 2-in. pipeline was run from the pits 1000 ft. (305m) south into an uninhabited valley. Portable [[compressors]] and a jet were used to bring the pits to sub-atmospheric pressure for the rest of the experiment. The safety radiation detectors shut down the reactor a few times during restart and were withdrawn to be further away from the reactor. Eventually, the reactor started back up and reached high power. \n\nOn November 12, operation of the reactor was demonstrated to Air Force and ANP personnel who had gathered at ORNL for a quarterly information meeting. [[Load following power plant|Load following]] was demonstrated by turning the blowers on and off. With all operational objectives attained, the decision to cease operation was made. Colonel Clyde D. Gasser was visiting the lab at this time and was invited to officiate the termination of the experiment. At 8:04 P.M., he scrammed the reactor for the last time. \n\n[[File:Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.jpg|thumb|Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

On November 13th, the fuel was transferred to the fuel dump tank. Pressurized carrier salt flushed the pipes and diluted the dump tank. Flush salt was heated to 100\u00b0F above the system temperature and pumped through the fuel channels. Operators observed the thermocouples to ensure flush salt flowed in all channels. \n\nAfter the fuel dump, the operating personnel had to evacuate the building for 1 hour after gas from the fuel purge operation which had been discharged out the stack descended and entered the ventilators on the building roof. The sodium system was drained without incident. \n\nTwo flat 6 ft. by 4 ft. [[Lead_shielding|lead shields]] with 2 inch thickness were suspended in the heat exchanger cell to protect decommissioning personnel from radiation from the fuel systems. \n\nWater lines were cut first. Then, sodium lines were cut with hack saws and immediately sealed with several layers of masking tape. The sodium pump was cleaned and the impeller was removed for examination. When the sodium pump and heat exchanger were removed, the radiation field in the room increased to 600 [[Roentgen_equivalent_man|mrem]]/hr. The equipment had been shielding the area from the fuel system radiation.\n\nThe fuel system was carefully dismantled starting in February, 1955. The main fuel pump bowl surveyed at 900 mrem/hr at 5 ft. A portable grinder that could be operated from within a lead box was built to cut the fuel lines near the reactor can. Once it was free, the reactor was moved to storage and later to a burial ground. The fuel in the dump tank was slated to be reprocessed.\n\nAbout 60 samples of equipment and material were taken for detailed analysis and examination. Metallographic, [[Neutron activation analysis|activation]], visual, [[Stereoscopy|stereophotographic]], and leak tests were performed. \n\n== Follow-up ==\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Test construction.jpg|thumb|Heavy construction to fit the ART in the building where ARE had been]]\nAfter the ARE operated, the ANP project moved on with plans to build a larger experiment, the 60 MW Aircraft Reactor Test (ART).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fraas |first1=A.P. |title=Design report on the Aircraft Reactor Test |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab |date=1956-12-21 |volume=ORNL-2095 |url=http://moltensalt.org/references/static/downloads/pdf/ORNL-2095.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> The ART was to be a NaF-ZrF<sub>4</sub>-UF<sub>4</sub>-fueled, Be-moderated, Be-reflected core with sodium metal as the reflector coolant and NaK as the secondary coolant.
