The oldest relic in Batujaya was estimated to originate from the 2nd century, while the latest dated from the 12th century. Subsequently, significant numbers of Buddhist sites were found in [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Jambi]], [[Bukit Seguntang|Palembang]], and [[Muara Takus|Riau]] provinces in Sumatra, as well as in [[Borobudur|Central]] and [[Jabung|East Java]]. The Indonesian archipelago has, over the centuries, witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires, such as the [[Sailendra]] dynasty, the [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]], and [[Srivijaya]] empires.\n\n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111359.jpg|thumb|[[Borobudur Temple Compounds]], located in Central Java, Indonesia]]\n\nAccording to some Chinese source, a Chinese Buddhist monk [[I Ching (monk)|I-tsing]] on his pilgrim journey to India, witnessed the powerful maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]] based on [[Sumatra]] in the 7th century. The empire served as a Buddhist learning center in the region.  A notable Srivijayan revered Buddhist scholar is [[Dharmakirti]], a Srivijayan prince of the [[Sailendra]] dynasty, born around the turn of the 7th century in Sumatra.<ref>P. 487 Buddhism: art, architecture, literature & philosophy, Volume 1</ref> He became a revered scholar-monk in Srivijaya and moved to [[India]] to become a teacher at the famed [[Nalanda University]], as well as a poet. He built on and reinterpreted the work of [[Dignaga]], the pioneer of [[Buddhist Logic]], and was very influential among Brahman logicians as well as Buddhists. His theories became normative in [[Tibet]] and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum. Other Buddhist monks that visited Indonesia were [[Atisha]], [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]], a professor of [[Nalanda]], and the South Indian Buddhist [[Vajrabodhi]]. Srivijaya was the largest Buddhist empire ever formed in Indonesian history.\n\nA number of Buddhist [[Cultural heritage|historical heritages]] can be found in Indonesia, including the 8th century [[Borobudur]] [[mandala]] monument and [[Sewu]] temple in [[Central Java]], [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] in West Java, [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Bahal temple]] in Sumatra, and numerous of statues or inscriptions from the earlier history of Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms.

Although some of kings might favour Hinduism over another, nevertheless the harmony, toleration, and even syncretism were promoted as manifested in [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]] national motto, coined from [[Kakawin Sutasoma]], written by Mpu Tantular to promotes tolerance between [[Hindu]]s (Shivaites) and [[Buddhist]]s.<ref>[http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD Depkumham.go.id] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212100545/http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD |date=2010-02-12 }}</ref> The classical era of ancient Java also had produces some of the exquisite examples of [[Buddhist art]]s, such as the statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] and the statue of Buddha Vairochana and Boddhisttva Padmapani and Vajrapani in [[Mendut]] temple.\n\n=== Decline and revival===\nIn the 13th century [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] entered the archipelago, and began gaining foothold in coastal port towns. The fall of Hindu-Buddhist [[Majapahit]] empire in late 15th century marked the end of dharmic civilization dominance in Indonesia. By the end of the 16th century, Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. After that for 450 years, there is no significant Buddhist adherence and practice in Indonesia. Many of Buddhist sites, stupas, temples, and manuscripts are lost or forgotten, as the region has become more predominantly Muslim. During this era of decline, there was only small numbers of people practicing Buddhism, most of them are [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese immigrants]] that settled in Indonesia with migration wave accelerated in the 17th century. Many of ''klenteng'' ([[Chinese temple]]s) in Indonesia are in fact a ''tridharma'' temple that houses three faiths, namely Buddhism, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]].\n\nIn 1934, [[Narada Thera]], a missionary monk from [[Sri Lanka]], visited [[Dutch East Indies]] (today Indonesia) for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A Bodhi tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of [[Borobudur]] on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks.<ref name =\"Buddhanet\">{{cite journal|title =Buddhism in Indonesia|publisher = Buddhanet|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/indo-txt.htm|accessdate =4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern Indonesia ===\n[[File:Borobudur on Vesak Day 2011.jpg|right|thumb|National vesak ceremony in Borobudur, Central Java.]]\nFollowing the [[Overthrow of Sukarno|downfall of President Sukarno]] in the mid-1960s, [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] was reasserted as the official Indonesian policy on religion to only recognise [[monotheistic|monotheism]].<ref>cf.

He was also backed up with the history behind the Indonesian version of Buddhism in ancient [[Javanese language|Javanese]] texts, and the shape of the Borobudur Temple.\n\nDuring the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era,  the state ideology of Pancasila listed Buddhism among the five official religions of [[Indonesia]].  The national leader of the time, [[Suharto]], had considered Buddhism and  [[Hinduism]] as Indonesian classical religions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe first [[Theravada]] ordination of [[bhikkhuni]]s in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung.<ref name=\"bhikkhuni1\">http://www.bhikkhuni.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FirstTheravadaordinationofbhikkhunisinIndonesiaAfteraThousandYears.pdf</ref> Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.<ref name=\"bhikkhuni1\"/>\n\nToday, in reference to the principle of Pancasila, a Buddhist monk representing the Buddhist Sangha, along with priest, Brahmin, pastor or representative of other recognized religions, would participate in nearly all state-sponsored ceremonies. The ceremony would always include a prayer (led by a Muslim imam with representatives of other faiths standing in a row behind him). Although the majority of Indonesian Buddhists are of the Chinese Mahayana school, more often than not the representative of Buddhism as selected by the Government would happen to be a Theravada monk.\n\nOnce a year, thousands of Buddhists from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national [[Vesak]] ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title =Vesak Festival: A Truly Sacred Experience |publisher =Wonderful Indonesia |url =http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |accessdate =4 May 2015 |url-status =dead |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150504193814/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |archivedate =4 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\nThe oldest extant esoteric Buddhist Mantranaya (largely a synonym of Mantrayana, Vajrayana and Buddhist Tantra) literature in [[Old Javanese]], a language significantly influenced by [[Sanskrit]], is enshrined in the ''Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shivabuddha.blogspot.com/search/label/lontar%20sang%20hyang%20kamahayanikan|title=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|author=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Lalitavistara Sutra]]'' was known to the [[Mantranaya]] stonemasons of [[Borobudur]], refer: [[The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)]].

Mantranaya is the term for the esoteric tradition on [[mantra]], a particular lineage of [[Vajrayana]] and [[Tantra]], in [[Indonesia]].

They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as [[Buddhist]]s by the Indonesian government.\n\nPockets of Javanese Buddhists also exist and are to be found mainly in villages and cities in Central and East Java. The regencies of Temanggung, Blitar and Jepara count about 30.000 Buddhists, mostly of Javanese ethnicity.\n\n=== Schools ===\nToday there are numerous Buddhist schools established in Indonesia. The earliest school that was established in Indonesia was [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], which developed from [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and which had some similarities with later Tibetan Buddhism. Various temples of ancient Java and Sumatra are Vajrayana. [[Chinese Buddhism]] (the main branch of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]) has gained followers from Chinese Indonesian populations that began to migrate into the archipelago during the 17th to 18th century. Other notable schools are [[Theravada]] Buddhism from Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nIndonesia's most notable Buddhist organization is Perwakilan Umat Buddha Indonesia (Walubi) which serves as the vehicle of all Buddhist schools in Indonesia. Other Buddhist organizations include Majelis Buddhayana Indonesia, Sangha Agung Indonesia (SAGIN), Sangha Theravada Indonesia (STI), Sangha Mahayana Indonesia, and the Taiwan-originated [[Tzu-Chi]].\n\n=== Religious events ===\n\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n|-\n|{{buddhism}}\n|}\nThe most important Buddhist religious event in Indonesia is [[Vesak]] ({{lang-id|Waisak}}).

Although the majority of Indonesian Buddhists are of the Chinese Mahayana school, more often than not the representative of Buddhism as selected by the Government would happen to be a Theravada monk.\n\nOnce a year, thousands of Buddhists from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national [[Vesak]] ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title =Vesak Festival: A Truly Sacred Experience |publisher =Wonderful Indonesia |url =http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |accessdate =4 May 2015 |url-status =dead |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150504193814/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/233/borobudur/article/7/vesak-festival-a-truly-sacred-experience |archivedate =4 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\nThe oldest extant esoteric Buddhist Mantranaya (largely a synonym of Mantrayana, Vajrayana and Buddhist Tantra) literature in [[Old Javanese]], a language significantly influenced by [[Sanskrit]], is enshrined in the ''Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shivabuddha.blogspot.com/search/label/lontar%20sang%20hyang%20kamahayanikan|title=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|author=SHIVA BUDDHA INDONESIA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Lalitavistara Sutra]]'' was known to the [[Mantranaya]] stonemasons of [[Borobudur]], refer: [[The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)]].

They are totally untouched by Islamic influence and worship animistic gods, incorporating some Hindu and Buddhist influences in their rituals and religious vocabulary. This group of Sasak, due in part to the name of their tribe, are recognized as [[Buddhist]]s by the Indonesian government.\n\nPockets of Javanese Buddhists also exist and are to be found mainly in villages and cities in Central and East Java. The regencies of Temanggung, Blitar and Jepara count about 30.000 Buddhists, mostly of Javanese ethnicity.\n\n=== Schools ===\nToday there are numerous Buddhist schools established in Indonesia. The earliest school that was established in Indonesia was [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], which developed from [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and which had some similarities with later Tibetan Buddhism. Various temples of ancient Java and Sumatra are Vajrayana. [[Chinese Buddhism]] (the main branch of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]) has gained followers from Chinese Indonesian populations that began to migrate into the archipelago during the 17th to 18th century. Other notable schools are [[Theravada]] Buddhism from Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nIndonesia's most notable Buddhist organization is Perwakilan Umat Buddha Indonesia (Walubi) which serves as the vehicle of all Buddhist schools in Indonesia.

{"title_page": "History of Buddhism in Cambodia", "text_new": "'''[[Theravada Buddhism]]''' is the [[state religion]] of '''[[Cambodia]]''', which has had been presented since at least the 5th century.\n\n==Suvannaphum==\nKing Ashoka sent missionaries to the land of Suwannaphum, which has sometimes been identified as the mainland southeast Asian region of [[Mon State|Mon]] (now a state in [[Myanmar]], the state of Mon) and Khmer (now Cambodia) people. The [[Mahavamsa]], a Sinhalese Pali chronicle, mentions these missions.<ref>[http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html The Mahavamsa, chapter 12, translated by Wilhelm Geiger]</ref>\n\n\"Unconfirmed Singhalese sources state that Buddhism was introduced to Suvannaphum, or the 'Golden Peninsula', as mainland Southeast Asia was once referred to, in the 3rd century B.C. under the reign of King [[Ashoka]], the great Buddhist ruler. According to these sources, two monks, Sona and Uttara, were sent to propagate the doctrine of the Master in this region following the great council of 274 B.C. held in Asoka's capital [[Patna|Pataliputta]], India. While this mission may be legendary, it indicates that Buddhism has been present in Southeast Asia for a long time. Various Buddhist sects and schools, including Tantrism, vied or coexisted with a dominant [[Brahmanism]] and indigenous animistic faiths for centuries before the rise of the classical Southeast Asian empires beginning in the 9th century A.D.  In part through Indian merchant traders, Indian cultural influence was pervasive in this early period. In Funan (1st to 5th century A.D.) the first organized Khmer polity, the Khmer people embraced not only the diverse Brahmanic and Buddhist religions but also the social customs and mores of India.\"<ref>Tully, John. ''France on the Mekong''.</ref>\n\n== Funan Kingdom ==\nIn the period between 100 BCE and 500 CE, the Kingdom of Funan in the present-day [[Mekong Delta]] established a flourishing seafaring trade between China, Indonesia, and India. This kingdom was Hindu, with the kings of Funan sponsoring the worship of [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]]. Buddhism was already present in Funan as a secondary religion in these earliest times.\n\nA [[Sanskrit]] inscription from 375 documents the presence of Buddhism in Funan.  King Kuandinya Jayavarman (478-514) cultivated Buddhism and sent a Buddhist mission complete with Funanese Buddhist images, carved in coral, to the Emperor of China.<ref name=gyallay>Gyallay-Pap, Peter. \"Notes of the Rebirth of Khmer Buddhism,\" ''Radical Conservativism''.</ref>\n\nAnother early inscription in Sanskrit dated 586\u2013664 at Wat [[Prey Vier]] notes that two Buddhist monks named Ratnabhanu and Ratnasimha were brothers. Chinese texts attest that Buddhism flourished in Cambodia in the last half of the 5th century, and that King Jayavarman sent the Indian monk Nagasena to present a [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire#Memorials|memorial]] in the Chinese Imperial court.<ref name=dawson>Dawson, Philip. ''The Art of Southeast Asia''.</ref>\n\nBuddhism was clearly beginning to assert its presence from about year 450 onward, and was observed by the Chinese traveler [[I Ching (monk)|I Ching]] toward the close of the seventh century.\n\n== Chenla Kingdom ==\nThe Kingdom of Chenla replaced Funan and endured from 500\u2013700. Chenla extended from the Mekong Delta, and along the lands surrounding the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers.\n\n\"According to [[Ma Touan-lin|Ma Touan-Lin]], a 13th century Chinese chronicler, there were ten monasteries of Buddhist monks and nuns studying the sacred texts in the 4th and 5th centuries. He stated that two monks from Funan traveled to China in this period at the request of the Chinese emperor, to translate the Sanskrit Tipitika into Chinese. A passage from the History of Leang, a Chinese chronicle written in 502-556, tells us that King Rudravarman sent a mission of monks to China in 535 under the direction of an Indian monk, Gunaratana. The delegation arrived in China in 546, accompanied by 240 palm leaf manuscripts of Mahayana Buddhist texts. Evidence of a cult of Buddha's relics was seen in Rudravarman's request of the Chinese emperor for a {{convert|12|ft|m|sing=on}} long relic of Buddha's hair.\"<ref name=ray>Ray, Nihar-Ranjan. ''Sanskrit Buddhism in Burma''.</ref>\n\nBuddhism was weakened in the Chenla period, but survived, as seen in the inscriptions of Sambor Prei Kuk (626) and those of Siem Reap dealing with the erection of statues of [[Avalokitesvara]] (791).  Some pre-Angkorean statuary in the Mekong Delta region indicate the existence of Sanskrit-based [[Sarvastivada]] Buddhism.<ref name=ray/>\n\nKhmer-style Buddha images are abundant from the period of 600\u2013800. Many Mahayana bodhisattva images also date from this period, often found alongside the predominantly Hindu images of Shiva and Vishnu.\n \nAn inscription from Ta Prohm temple in Bali province, dated about 625, states, that the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are flourishing.<ref name=dawson/>\n\n== Angkor Kingdom ==\nThe transition from Hindu god-king to Mahayana Buddha-king was probably gradual and imperceptible. The prevailing [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] and [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] faith traditions gave way to the worship of the [[Gautama Buddha]] and the [[Avalokitesvara|Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara]].\n\nKing Jayavarman II (802-869) is the first real Khmer king of the [[Angkor]] Empire. He proclaimed himself god-king and began to establish the capital of Angkor (Rolous) near present-day Angkor Wat.\n\nThe Buddhist [[Sailendra]] kingdom exercised suzerainty over Cambodia as a vassal state during the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth centuries.  As a result, Jayavarman, as a young man, had lived in the court of [[Java]] and had visited [[Sumatra]].  When he returned to Cambodia, he proclaimed himself a god-king (deva-raja) according to Khmer traditions, identifying himself with [[Shiva]].  Nevertheless, he was increasingly friendly to and supportive of Mahayana Buddhist influence throughout his kingdom.<ref name=omurray>O'Murray, Stephen. ''Angkor Life''.</ref>\n\nWhen King Jayavarman II returned to Cambodia from Java, he built three capitals in succession: [[Hariharalaya]], [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Amarendrapura]], and [[Mahendraparvata (ancient city)|Mahendraparvata]]. One of these, Amarendrapura, identified with Banteai Chmar, was a Mahayana Buddhist city presided over by Avalokitesvara, the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion.\n\nMahayana Buddhism therefore became increasingly established in his empire. The form of Mahayana Buddhism that was propagated in the Srivijaya lands was similar to the [[Pala Dynasty]] Buddhism of Bengal, and of the [[Nalanda]] University in northern India.\n\n\"The Bengal University of Nalanda in Megadha (now Behar) was the theological center of Mahayana Buddhism under the protection of the Pala Dynasty [750-1060]. Shivaist interpretations of Buddhism, tinged with Tantric mysticism (that may have revived portions of pre-Aryan northeastern Indian faith traditions) were worked out in Megadha and then were exported throughout insular and peninsular Southeast Asia, particularly to Java. Yashovarman I (889-910), who ruled from the vicinity of Rolous in the late ninth century, seems to have been a [[Shaivism|Shivite]] Buddhist influenced by Nalanda syncretism. His successors (notably Jayavarman IV) dedicated themselves to Vishnu and Brahma, as well as to Shiva, with whom they continued to be identified by hereditary families of priests. Rajendravarman II studied Buddhism intensely.\"<ref name=dawson/>\n\nThe Sailendra dynasty also built the fantastic Mahayana Buddhist temple [[Borobudur]] (750-850) in Java. Borobudur appears to have been the inspiration for the later fabulous Angkor building projects in Cambodia, particularly [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Angkor Thom]].\n\nThe primary form of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia during Angkor times was Mahayana Buddhism, strongly influenced with Tantric tendencies.\n\n\"The prevalence of Tantrayana in Java, Sumatra and Kamboja [Cambodia], a fact now definitely established by modern researches into the character of Mahayana Buddhism and Sivaism in these parts of the Indian Orient. Already in Kamboja inscription of the 9th century there is definite evidence of the teaching of Tantric texts at the court of Jayavarman II. In a Kamboja record of the 11th century there is a reference to the 'Tantras of the Paramis'; and images of Hevajra, definitely a tantric divinity, have been recovered from amidst the ruins of Angkor Thom. A number of Kamboja inscriptions refer to several kings who were initiated into the Great Secret (Vrah Guhya) by their Brahmanical gurus; the Saiva records make obvious records to Tantric doctrines that had crept into Sivaism.\"\n\n\"But it was in Java and Sumatra that Tantrayana seems to have attained greater importance. There Mahayana Buddhism and [[Shaivism]], both deeply imbued with tantric influences, are to be seen often blending with one another during this period. The Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan, consisting of Sanskrit verses explained by an Old Javanese commentary, professed to teach the Mahayana and Mantrayana.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\nThe presence and growing influence of Buddhism continued as the Angkor empire increased in power. King Yosavarman built many Buddhist temples in 887\u2013889, representing the mandala of [[Sumeru|Mount Meru]], the mythical axis of the world. The largest of these temples is Phnom Kandal or \"Central Mountain\" which lies near the heart of the Angkor complex.\n\nKing Rajendravarman II (944-968) \"studied Buddhism intensely. Although he decided to remain a Shivaist, he appointed a Buddhist, Kavindrarimathana, chief minister. Kavindrarimathana built shrines to Buddha and Shiva. Jayavarman V (son of Rajendravarman) also remained a devote of Shiva. He, too, permitted his own chief minister, Kirtipandita, to foster Mahayana Buddhist learning and divination.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\n=== Suryavarman I ===\nSuryavarman I (1006\u20131050) <sup>[9]</sup> is considered the greatest of the Buddhist kings, with the exception of Jayavarman VII.\n\nThe origins of Suryavarman I are unclear but evidence point that he began his career in northeastern Cambodia. He came to the throne after a period of disputes between rival claims to the Khmer throne. However, the term \"usurper\" is not appropriate when speaking in the Khmer context of royal succession as the Khmer throne did not exclusively include paternal lines but also recognized and even valued more to an extent the royal maternal line.<sup>[10]</sup>\n\nA strong proponent of Mahayana Buddhism, he did not interfere or obstruct the growing presence and dissemination of Theravada Buddhism during his reign.\n\n=== Jayavarman VII ===\n[[Jayavarman VII]] (1181\u20131215) was the greatest of all Khmer Buddhist kings. Jayavarman VII worked tirelessly to establish Buddhism as the state religion of Angkor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nHe was already an elderly man, perhaps 60, when he ascended the throne. Before becoming king, he had devoted his long life to meditation and tantra.\n\nSensing his mortality he worked feverishly to accomplish his works in \"saving\" the Khmer people and establishing a Buddhist empire in a race against time.\n\nIn 1177, the Cham Kingdom of central Vietnam had invaded and sacked Angkor, creating a sense of trauma and crisis throughout the Khmer Empire by attacking and looting the capital. King Jayavarman VII ascended the throne in a climate of crisis, and war.\n\nJayavarman VII was a Mahayana Buddhist, and he regarded himself to be a Dharma-king, a bodhisattva, whose duty was to \"save the people\" through service and merit-making, liberating himself in the process.\n\nScholars speculate why Khmer royalty rejected Hinduism and embraced Buddhism definitively at this time. Perhaps, they suggest, Jayavarman and his people had become disillusioned with the Hindu gods because of their failure to protect the Angkor Empire from being sacked by their enemies, the Cham. The Cham themselves were Hindu and worshiped Shiva, and the Khmer may have therefore felt an instinctive revulsion at the religion of their enemies.\n\nJayavarman withdrew his devotion from the old gods and began to identify more openly with Buddhist traditions. His regime marked a clear dividing line with the old Hindu past.\n\nBefore 1200, art in the temples mostly portrayed scenes from the Hindu pantheon such as Vishnu reclining on a lotus leaf, or the churning of the primeval sea of the milk of creation. After 1200, scenes from the Buddhist Jatakas, and life of the Buddha, along with scenes of the Ramayana began to appear as standard motif.\n\nAs a \"bodhisattva king\" Jayavarman VII was considered to be a living Buddha, or bodhisattva who turned his back from the brink of enlightenment to redeem or save his people from suffering; he imagined himself in a role similar to that of the present day Dalai Lama of Tibet.\n\nImages of Jayavarman portray him in the ascetic pose seated in meditation with a serene, enlightened expression. He built numerous public works to serve the people, including waterworks, hospitals, temples, hospices for travelers.\n\nStone inscriptions say he \"suffered from the maladies of his subjects more than from his own; for it is the public griefs that make a king's grief, and not his own.\"\n\nAnother inscription reads: \"Filled with a deep sympathy for the good of the world, the king swore this oath; 'All beings who are plunged in the ocean of existence, may I draw them out by virtue of this good work. And may the kings of Cambodia who come after me, attached to goodness...attain with their wives, dignitaries and friends, the place of deliverance where there is no more illness.'\"\n\nProfound psychological change was underway in Jayavarman VII's reign. There was a shift away from the cult of devaraja god-king, toward the cult of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the cult of monks. In former times, great effort and resources were invested into building temples for elite brahman priests and god-kings. Under Jayavarman, these resources were redirected to building libraries, monastic dwellings, public works, and more \"earthly\" projects accessible to the common people.\n\nHis temple, the [[Bayon]] in [[Angkor Thom]], is the first temple built without walls, indicating its openness to all the people, not exclusive to the god-king and his Brahmin priests. The walls of the Bayon are decorated with scenes from the daily life of the people fishing, eating, gambling and [[cock-fighting]], rather than the heroic deeds of gods and kings.\n\nKing Jayavarman considered the Bayon as his masterpiece, his \"bride.\" A stone inscription says \"the town of Yosadharapura, decorated with powder and jewels, burning with desire, the daughter of a good family...who married by the king in the course of a festival that lacked nothing, under the spreading dais of his \nprotection.\"\n\nThe purpose of this mystical marriage of King and people, the inscription goes on to say, was the \"procreation of happiness throughout the universe.\"\n\nThe building projects commissioned by Jayavarman were redolent with tantric Buddhist symbolism. The word \"bayon\" means \"ancestor [[yantra]]\" - a magic symbol of geometric shape of [[tantric Buddhism]]. In the center of the Bayon temple was an image of Buddha-[[Mucalinda]]: the Buddha sitting on a seven-headed cobra, with the serpent's hood unveiled above the Buddha as protection from the elements. The Buddha image has the features of Jayavarman VII himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nJayavarman other major temple projects included [[Preah Khan]] and [[Ta Prohm]].\n\nWhile Jayavarman VII himself was Mahayana Buddhist, the presence of Theravada Buddhism was increasingly evident. \"This Singhalese-based Theravada Buddhist orthodoxy was first propagated in Southeast Asia by Taling (Mon) monks in the 11th century and together with Islam in the 13th century in southern insular reaches of the region, spread as a popularly-based movement among the people. Apart from inscriptions, such as one of Lopburi, there were other signs that the religious  venue of Suvannabhumi were changing. Tamalinda, the Khmer monk believed to be the son of Jayavarman VII, took part in an 1180 Burmese-led mission to Sri Lanka to study the Pali canon and on his return in 1190 had adepts of the Sinhala doctrine in his court. Zhou Daguan, who led a Chinese mission into Angkor in 1296-97 confirms the significant presence of Pali Theravada monks in the Khmer Capital.\"<ref name=gyallay/>\n\n== Decline of Angkor &amp; the Emergence of a Theravada Kingdom ==\nAfter the 13th century Theravada Buddhism became the state religion of Cambodia.\n\nKing Jayavarman VII had sent his son Tamalinda to [[Sri Lanka]] to be ordained as a Buddhist monk and study Theravada Buddhism according to the [[Pali]] scriptural traditions. Tamalinda then returned to Cambodia and promoted Buddhist traditions according to the Theravada training he had received, galvanizing and energizing the long-standing Theravada presence that had existed throughout the Angkor empire for centuries.\n\nDuring the time Tamalinda studied at the famous [[Mahavihara]] Monastery in Sri Lanka (1180\u20131190), a new dynamic type of Theravada Buddhism was being preached as the \"true faith\" in Sri Lanka. This form of Buddhism was somewhat militant and highly disciplined in reaction to the wars with the Tamil that nearly destroyed Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 9th and 10th centuries.  As Theravada Buddhism struggled for survival in Sri Lanka, it developed a resiliency that generated a renaissance throughout the Buddhist world, and would eventually spread across Burma, Chang Mai, the Mon kingdoms, Lana, Sukothai, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=keyes>Keyes, Charles. ''The Golden Peninsula''.</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century, wandering missionaries from the Mon-Khmer-speaking parts of Siam, Burma, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka played an important part in this process.\n\nWhen Prince Tamalinda returned after ten years of ordination, he was a Thera, a senior monk, capable of administering ordination into this vigorous Theravada lineage, which insisted on orthodoxy and rejected Mahayana \"innovations\" such as tantric practices.\n\nSome scholars have argued that the transition from Mahayana to Theravada was more gradual than it was generally believed. French scholar Nicolas Revire has studied an Angkor stele, now at the [[Bangkok National Museum]], depicting as late as the 13th or 14th century the Mahayana image of Buddha's birth where Buddha emerges from his mother's side at the moment of delivery. Revire believes this suggests that a kind of Mahayana \u201cleftover \u2018behavior\u2019\u201d persisted even after the institutional transition to Theravada had been completed.<ref>Nicolas Revire, \u201c\u2018The Birth of the Buddha\u2019 at Angkor,\u201d ''Journal of the Siam Society'' 107, 2019, 63-90 (82).</ref>\n\n[[Image:BuddhistMonk01a.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Buddhist nun. [[Bayon]] Temple, Angkor Wat, Siem Reap, Cambodia (January 2005).]]\nThe mass conversion of Khmer society to Theravada Buddhism amounted to a [[nonviolent revolution]] every all level of society. All monumental building projects that had characterized the Angkor empire came to a sudden end. Scholars struggle to account for this sudden and inexplicable transformation of Khmer civilization.\n\nTheravada Buddhism succeeded because it was inclusive and universal in its outreach, recruiting the disciples and monks from not only the elites and court, but also in the villages and among the peasants, enhancing its popularity among the Khmer folk.\n\n\"Their message succeeded because it provided a meaningful way of relating to the world for many who had been marginal to the classical civilizations or who had been seriously affected by the disruption of the classical civilizations in the 13th and 14th centuries.\"<ref name=keyes/>\n\nJournalist Elizabeth Becker explained the phenomenon: \"Cambodians were ripe for conversion. The political integrity and morality of the kingdom were thrown into question at the time, and Cambodians converted en masse to this new faith that offered social tranquility without striving for material gain or power. The modest Buddhist bonzes were a welcome change from the arrogant and wealthy priests of the kings. The new Buddhists dressed in simple saffron robes. They possessed a sense of responsibility for all, not just the nobility. Eventually they became as revered as the devaraja, who in turn became a Theravada Buddhist himself as patron of the faith.\"<ref>Becker, Elizabeth. ''When the War Was Over''.</ref>\n\nOther scholars suggest that the classical Angkor Empire collapsed from desertion from within and assault from without, from growing external threats and assaults from Siam and Vietnam which were both in ascendancy at the time.\n\n\"The post-Angkor period saw the dramatic rise of the Pali Theravada tradition in Southeast Asia and concomitant decline of the Brahmanic and Mahayana Buddhist religious traditions. A 1423 Thai account of a mission to Sri Lanka mentions eight Khmer monks who again brought orthodox Mahavihara sect of Singhalese order to Kampuchea. This particular event belied, however, the profound societal shift that was taking place from priestly class structure to a village-based monastic system in Theravada lands. While adhering to the monastic discipline, monks developed their wats, or temple-monasteries, not only into moral religious but also education, social-service, and cultural centers for the people. Wats became the main source of learning and popular education. Early western explorers, settlers, and missionaries reported widespread literacy among the male populations of Burma, Thailand, Kampuchea, Laos, and Vietnam. Until the 19th century, literacy rates exceeded those of Europe in most if not all Theravada lands. In Kampuchea, Buddhism became the transmitter of Khmer language and culture.\"<ref name=gyallay/>\n\nThe Theravada revolution was therefor a grassroots movement of the Khmer people rejecting some of the oppressive practices of the god-king religion of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nWith the rise of Siam in the west and Vietnam in the east, the classical Angkor empire disappeared and the beginning of present-day Cambodia began. The center of government began to migrate away from Angkor to a more central location in the center of Cambodia, in the regions near present-day Phnom Penh.\n\nCambodia became from this time forward a Theravada Buddhist nation. \"Theravada Buddhism, unlike almost all the previous religions of the country, its doctrines were not imposed from above but were preached to the people. It was simple, required no expensive priesthood or temples and little ceremonial. Its missionaries practiced austerity, solitude, humility, and poverty. Their example and their direct contact with the people started to undermine the old state religion and the monastery which rested upon it. Theravada Buddhism remained the great belief and comfort of the Khmer people until 1975.\"<ref>Shawcross, William. ''Sideshow''.</ref>\n\nZhou Daguan, a Chinese visitor to the Royal Court of Cambodia at this time wrote of the presence of Theravada Buddhist monks in the latter days of Angkor.\n\nZhou Daguan was an emissary from the court of Timur Khan, Emperor of China. Daguan lived in Angkor Thom for one year 1296-7 and wrote a small book about his observations in which he described Theravada monks with shaved heads, yellow robes and one shoulder bare, walking barefoot throughout Cambodia. Their temples were simple, he said, containing one image of Sakyamuni Buddha. The image was draped in yellow cloth.\n\nThe Theravada monks ate meat or fish but did not drink wine. They ate only one meal a day. They did not cook in the temple, but lived on alms food.\n\n\"The books they recited from were very numerous. These were made of neatly bound palm leaves covered with black writing. Some of the monks were royal counselors, and therefore had the right to be conveyed in palanquins with gold shafts accompanied by umbrellas with gold or silver handles. There were no Buddhist nuns.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\n== Middle Ages ==\n\nThe Jinakalamali gives an account of the cultural connections between Cambodia and Sri Lanka in the fifteenth century. It states that 1967<sup>(1967?? Perhaps 1697)</sup>  years after theMahaparinibbana of the Buddha, eight monks headed by Mahananasiddhi from Cambodia with 25 monks from Nabbispura in Thailand came to Sri Lanka to receive the umpasampada ordination at the hands of the Sinhalese Mahatheras.\n \nAs Angkor collapsed under the advancing jungles, the centre of power of the Theravada Cambodia moved south toward present day [[Phnom Penh]]. Phnom Penh was originally a small riverside market center where the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap River converge.\n\nPhnom Penh was founded when Lady Penh found a \"four-faced Buddha\" floating down the river on a Koki tree during the flooding season. She retrieved the Buddha image and had the Wat Phnom constructed to house the image. The four-faced Buddha [Buddha facing the four directions] is important in Khmer Buddhist iconography, signifying the establishment of the kingdom of the Buddha of the Future, [[Maitreya]], who is often identified with the Buddha-king of Cambodia.\n\nAfter 1431 when the Cambodian kings permanently abandoned Angkor due to a Siamese invasion, the royal court was located on Udon Mountain, a few kilometres north of Phnom Penh. Siamese incursions from the west and Vietnamese invasions from the east weakened the Khmer empire. The Vietnamese invaders attempted to suppress Theravada Buddhism and force the Khmer people to practice Mahayana Buddhism. The Siamese, on the other hand, would periodically invade Cambodia and attempt to drive out the \"unbelievers\" in an attempt to protect the Theravada religion. This power-struggle between the two ascendant powers continued until the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th century.\n\nBuddhism continued to flourish in Cambodia in the sixteenth century. King Ang Chan (1516\u20131566), a relative of King Dhammaraja, was a devout Buddhist. He built pagodas in his capital and many Buddhist shrines in different parts of Cambodia. In order to popularize Buddhism, King Satha (1576-1549), son and successor of King Barom Reachea, restored the great towers of the Angkor Wat, which had become a Buddhist shrine by the sixteenth century.\n\nWhen Western merchants and missionaries first made contact with Cambodia, they discovered a three-tiered society consisting of the nobility, the common people (who were primarily rice farmers), and the Buddhist monks who were custodians of Khmer culture and identity.\n\nEach successive wave of European influence was accompanied by Catholic missionaries, but Theravada Buddhism proved surprisingly resistant to foreign attempts to convert the Khmer people.\n\nIn 1556, the Portuguese missionary Gaspar de Cruz spent about a year in Cambodia and visited the capital at Lovek where King Cham reigned. The missionary complained bitterly of his inability to convert the Khmer people to Christianity, and blamed the Buddhist monks for his failure: The monks, he said, are \"exceedingly proud and vain...alive they are worshiped for gods, in so that the inferior among them do worship the superior like gods, praying unto them and prostrating themselves before them; and so the common people have great confidence in them, with great reverence and worship; so that there is no person that dare contradict them in anything... [It] happened sometimes that while I was preaching, many round me hearing me very well, and being very satisfied with what I told them, that if there came along any of these priests and said, 'This is good but ours is better,' they would all depart and leave me alone.'\"<ref>Chandler, David. ''A History of Cambodia''.</ref>\n\n== Colonial Era ==\nDuring the colonial period, the peace was periodically breached by outbreaks of religiously motivated violence.  Periodic millenarian revolts, often led by charismatic monks or self-proclaimed holy men.  In 1820\u201321, a Millennial uprising was led by a former monk named Kai, who was recognized as a holy man with supernatural powers. He organized a revolt against the Vietnamese overlords from his hideout in Ba Phanom.\n\nDuring the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, Thailand's involvement in Cambodian politics extended Thai influence into religious matters as well.  In 1855, King [[Norodom]] invited monks from the Thai [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] to establish a Dhammayuttika presence in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=83}}</ref>  Maha Pan, a Khmer monk who had studied under some of the same teachers as Thailand's [[Mongkut]], was appointed the first [[sangharaja]] of the new Khmer Dhammayuttika tradition (usually referred to as 'Thommayut'), taking up residence at Wat Botum Vaddey, a new temple built adjacent to the palace in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\"/>\n\nThe newly formed Thommayut order benefited from royal patronage, but frequently came into conflict with the existing Mohanikay (Mahanikaya) lineage.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\"/>  The Thommayut were sometimes accused of holding loyalty to the Thai court, rather than to the Khmer nation.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|pp=83\u20134}}</ref>\n\nCambodia was recognized by the West as a \"protectorate\" of France in 1867.<ref>{{Harv|Wyatt|2003|p=180}}</ref>  Over the course of the next forty years, the territory of modern Cambodia was integrated as a colony into French Indo-China through a series of \"protective\" agreements with the Vietnamese, and treaty concessions from [[Thailand]].<ref>{{Harv|Wyatt|2003|pp=189\u201391}}</ref>  Periodic convulsions of violence, led by Buddhist holy men, would periodically break out against the French.\n\nDuring the era of French rule, significant advances were made in the education of Cambodian monks, both in specifically Buddhist topics and more general studies.

Monks were also encouraged to become involved in community development projects.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 p\"/>\n\n== Khmer Rouge Era ==\nIn 1975 when the communist Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia, they tried to completely destroy Buddhism and very nearly succeeded. By the time of the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, nearly every monk and religious intellectual had been either murdered or driven into exile, and nearly every temple and Buddhist temple and library had been destroyed.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge policies towards Buddhism- which included the forcible disrobing of monks, the destruction of monasteries, and, ultimately, the execution of uncooperative monks effectively destroyed Cambodia's Buddhist institutions.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=74}}</ref>  Monks who did not flee and avoided execution lived among the laity, sometimes secretly performing Buddhist rituals for the sick or afflicted.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\"/>\n\nEstimates vary regarding the number of monks in Cambodia prior to the ascension of the Khmer Rouge, ranging between 65,000 and 80,000.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 78\u201382\">{{Harv|Rajavaramuni|1984|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>  By the time of the Buddhist restoration in the early 1980s, the number of Cambodian monks worldwide was estimated to be less than 3,000.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\u20136\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|pp=75\u20136}}</ref>  The patriarchs of both Cambodian [[nikaya]]s perished sometime during the period 1975\u201378, though the cause of their deaths is not known.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 78\u201382\"/>\n\nDue to their association with the Thai monarchy, monks of the Thommayut order may have been particularly targeted for persecution.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=84}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnamese Occupation ==\nFollowing the defeat of the Khmer Rouge by forces of the Vietnamese government, Buddhism initially remained officially suppressed within Cambodia.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\"/>  Following challenges to the legitimacy of the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, policies towards Buddhism began to liberalize starting in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=75}}</ref>  A group of monks who had been exiled and re-ordained in Vietnam during the Khmer Rouge period were sent to Cambodia,<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=93}}</ref> and in 1981 one of their number, Venerable Tep Vong, was elected the first [[sangharaja]] of a new unified Cambodia sangha, officially abolishing the division between the Thommayut order and the Mohanikay.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\"/>  The ordination of new monks was sponsored by the government as a public show of piety and lifted restrictions on ordination.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\u20136\"/>\n\n== Modern Era ==\nToday Buddhism is struggling to re-establish itself although the lack of Buddhist scholars and leaders and the continuing political instability makes the task difficult.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Vietnamese military, the newly renamed [[Cambodian People's Party]] sought to align itself with the Buddhist sangha, declaring Buddhism to be Cambodia's 'state religion' in a 1991 policy statement<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=76}}</ref>  In 1991, King [[Sihanouk]] returned from exile and appointed a new [[sangharaja]] for each of the Thommayut and Mohanikay orders, effectively marking the end of the unified system created under Vietnamese rule in 1981.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=77}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n\n{{Asia topic|Buddhism in}}\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Cambodia topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Buddhism In Cambodia}}\n[[Category:Buddhism in Cambodia|.]]\n[[Category:History of Buddhism by country|Cambodia]]\n[[Category:History of Cambodia|Buddhism]]\n[[Category:Social history of Cambodia|Buddhism]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Theravada Buddhism]]''' is the [[state religion]] of '''[[Cambodia]]''', which has had been presented since at least the 5th century.\n\n==Suvannaphum==\nKing Ashoka sent missionaries to the land of Suwannaphum, which has sometimes been identified as the mainland southeast Asian region of [[Mon State|Mon]] (now a state in [[Myanmar]], the state of Mon) and Khmer (now Cambodia) people. The [[Mahavamsa]], a Sinhalese Pali chronicle, mentions these missions.<ref>[http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html The Mahavamsa, chapter 12, translated by Wilhelm Geiger]</ref>\n\n\"Unconfirmed Singhalese sources state that Buddhism was introduced to Suvannaphum, or the 'Golden Peninsula', as mainland Southeast Asia was once referred to, in the 3rd century B.C. under the reign of King [[Ashoka]], the great Buddhist ruler. According to these sources, two monks, Sona and Uttara, were sent to propagate the doctrine of the Master in this region following the great council of 274 B.C. held in Asoka's capital [[Patna|Pataliputta]], India. While this mission may be legendary, it indicates that Buddhism has been present in Southeast Asia for a long time. Various Buddhist sects and schools, including Tantrism, vied or coexisted with a dominant [[Brahmanism]] and indigenous animistic faiths for centuries before the rise of the classical Southeast Asian empires beginning in the 9th century A.D.  In part through Indian merchant traders, Indian cultural influence was pervasive in this early period. In Funan (1st to 5th century A.D.) the first organized Khmer polity, the Khmer people embraced not only the diverse Brahmanic and Buddhist religions but also the social customs and mores of India.\"<ref>Tully, John. ''France on the Mekong''.</ref>\n\n== Funan Kingdom ==\nIn the period between 100 BCE and 500 CE, the Kingdom of Funan in the present-day [[Mekong Delta]] established a flourishing seafaring trade between China, Indonesia, and India. This kingdom was Hindu, with the kings of Funan sponsoring the worship of [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]]. Buddhism was already present in Funan as a secondary religion in these earliest times.\n\nA [[Sanskrit]] inscription from 375 documents the presence of Buddhism in Funan.  King Kuandinya Jayavarman (478-514) cultivated Buddhism and sent a Buddhist mission complete with Funanese Buddhist images, carved in coral, to the Emperor of China.<ref name=gyallay>Gyallay-Pap, Peter. \"Notes of the Rebirth of Khmer Buddhism,\" ''Radical Conservativism''.</ref>\n\nAnother early inscription in Sanskrit dated 586-664 at Wat [[Prey Vier]] notes that two Buddhist monks named Ratnabhanu and Ratnasimha were brothers. Chinese texts attest that Buddhism flourished in Cambodia in the last half of the 5th century, and that King Jayavarman sent the Indian monk Nagasena to present a [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire#Memorials|memorial]] in the Chinese Imperial court.<ref name=dawson>Dawson, Philip. ''The Art of Southeast Asia''.</ref>\n\nBuddhism was clearly beginning to assert its presence from about year 450 onward, and was observed by the Chinese traveler [[I Ching (monk)|I Ching]] toward the close of the seventh century.\n\n== Chenla Kingdom ==\nThe Kingdom of Chenla replaced Funan and endured from 500-700. Chenla extended from the Mekong Delta, and along the lands surrounding the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers.\n\n\"According to [[Ma Touan-lin|Ma Touan-Lin]], a 13th century Chinese chronicler, there were ten monasteries of Buddhist monks and nuns studying the sacred texts in the 4th and 5th centuries. He stated that two monks from Funan traveled to China in this period at the request of the Chinese emperor, to translate the Sanskrit Tipitika into Chinese. A passage from the History of Leang, a Chinese chronicle written in 502-556, tells us that King Rudravarman sent a mission of monks to China in 535 under the direction of an Indian monk, Gunaratana. The delegation arrived in China in 546, accompanied by 240 palm leaf manuscripts of Mahayana Buddhist texts. Evidence of a cult of Buddha's relics was seen in Rudravarman's request of the Chinese emperor for a {{convert|12|ft|m|sing=on}} long relic of Buddha's hair.\"<ref name=ray>Ray, Nihar-Ranjan. ''Sanskrit Buddhism in Burma''.</ref>\n\nBuddhism was weakened in the Chenla period, but survived, as seen in the inscriptions of Sambor Prei Kuk (626) and those of Siem Reap dealing with the erection of statues of [[Avalokitesvara]] (791).  Some pre-Angkorean statuary in the Mekong Delta region indicate the existence of Sanskrit-based [[Sarvastivada]] Buddhism.<ref name=ray/>\n\nKhmer-style Buddha images are abundant from the period of 600-800. Many Mahayana bodhisattva images also date from this period, often found alongside the predominantly Hindu images of Shiva and Vishnu.\n \nAn inscription from Ta Prohm temple in Bali province, dated about 625, states, that the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are flourishing.<ref name=dawson/>\n\n== Angkor Kingdom ==\nThe transition from Hindu god-king to Mahayana Buddha-king was probably gradual and imperceptible. The prevailing [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] and [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] faith traditions gave way to the worship of the [[Gautama Buddha]] and the [[Avalokitesvara|Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara]].\n\nKing Jayavarman II (802-869) is the first real Khmer king of the [[Angkor]] Empire. He proclaimed himself god-king and began to establish the capital of Angkor (Rolous) near present-day Angkor Wat.\n\nThe Buddhist [[Sailendra]] kingdom exercised suzerainty over Cambodia as a vassal state during the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth centuries.  As a result, Jayavarman, as a young man, had lived in the court of [[Java]] and had visited [[Sumatra]].  When he returned to Cambodia, he proclaimed himself a god-king (deva-raja) according to Khmer traditions, identifying himself with [[Shiva]].  Nevertheless, he was increasingly friendly to and supportive of Mahayana Buddhist influence throughout his kingdom.<ref name=omurray>O'Murray, Stephen. ''Angkor Life''.</ref>\n\nWhen King Jayavarman II returned to Cambodia from Java, he built three capitals in succession: [[Hariharalaya]], [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Amarendrapura]], and [[Mahendraparvata (ancient city)|Mahendraparvata]]. One of these, Amarendrapura, identified with Banteai Chmar, was a Mahayana Buddhist city presided over by Avalokitesvara, the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion.\n\nMahayana Buddhism therefore became increasingly established in his empire. The form of Mahayana Buddhism that was propagated in the Srivijaya lands was similar to the [[Pala Dynasty]] Buddhism of Bengal, and of the [[Nalanda]] University in northern India.\n\n\"The Bengal University of Nalanda in Megadha (now Behar) was the theological center of Mahayana Buddhism under the protection of the Pala Dynasty [750-1060]. Shivaist interpretations of Buddhism, tinged with Tantric mysticism (that may have revived portions of pre-Aryan northeastern Indian faith traditions) were worked out in Megadha and then were exported throughout insular and peninsular Southeast Asia, particularly to Java. Yashovarman I (889-910), who ruled from the vicinity of Rolous in the late ninth century, seems to have been a [[Shaivism|Shivite]] Buddhist influenced by Nalanda syncretism. His successors (notably Jayavarman IV) dedicated themselves to Vishnu and Brahma, as well as to Shiva, with whom they continued to be identified by hereditary families of priests. Rajendravarman II studied Buddhism intensely.\"<ref name=dawson/>\n\nThe Sailendra dynasty also built the fantastic Mahayana Buddhist temple [[Borobudur]] (750-850) in Java. Borobudur appears to have been the inspiration for the later fabulous Angkor building projects in Cambodia, particularly [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Angkor Thom]].\n\nThe primary form of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia during Angkor times was Mahayana Buddhism, strongly influenced with Tantric tendencies.\n\n\"The prevalence of Tantrayana in Java, Sumatra and Kamboja [Cambodia], a fact now definitely established by modern researches into the character of Mahayana Buddhism and Sivaism in these parts of the Indian Orient. Already in Kamboja inscription of the 9th century there is definite evidence of the teaching of Tantric texts at the court of Jayavarman II. In a Kamboja record of the 11th century there is a reference to the 'Tantras of the Paramis'; and images of Hevajra, definitely a tantric divinity, have been recovered from amidst the ruins of Angkor Thom. A number of Kamboja inscriptions refer to several kings who were initiated into the Great Secret (Vrah Guhya) by their Brahmanical gurus; the Saiva records make obvious records to Tantric doctrines that had crept into Sivaism.\"\n\n\"But it was in Java and Sumatra that Tantrayana seems to have attained greater importance. There Mahayana Buddhism and [[Shaivism]], both deeply imbued with tantric influences, are to be seen often blending with one another during this period. The Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan, consisting of Sanskrit verses explained by an Old Javanese commentary, professed to teach the Mahayana and Mantrayana.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\nThe presence and growing influence of Buddhism continued as the Angkor empire increased in power. King Yosavarman built many Buddhist temples in 887-889, representing the mandala of [[Sumeru|Mount Meru]], the mythical axis of the world. The largest of these temples is Phnom Kandal or \"Central Mountain\" which lies near the heart of the Angkor complex.\n\nKing Rajendravarman II (944-968) \"studied Buddhism intensely. Although he decided to remain a Shivaist, he appointed a Buddhist, Kavindrarimathana, chief minister. Kavindrarimathana built shrines to Buddha and Shiva. Jayavarman V (son of Rajendravarman) also remained a devote of Shiva. He, too, permitted his own chief minister, Kirtipandita, to foster Mahayana Buddhist learning and divination.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\n=== Suryavarman I ===\nSuryavarman I (1006\u20131050) <sup>[9]</sup> is considered the greatest of the Buddhist kings, with the exception of Jayavarman VII.\n\nThe origins of Suryavarman I are unclear but evidence point that he began his career in northeastern Cambodia. He came to the throne after a period of disputes between rival claims to the Khmer throne. However, the term \"usurper\" is not appropriate when speaking in the Khmer context of royal succession as the Khmer throne did not exclusively include paternal lines but also recognized and even valued more to an extent the royal maternal line.<sup>[10]</sup>\n\nA strong proponent of Mahayana Buddhism, he did not interfere or obstruct the growing presence and dissemination of Theravada Buddhism during his reign.\n\n=== Jayavarman VII ===\n[[Jayavarman VII]] (1181\u20131215) was the greatest of all Khmer Buddhist kings. Jayavarman VII worked tirelessly to establish Buddhism as the state religion of Angkor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nHe was already an elderly man, perhaps 60, when he ascended the throne. Before becoming king, he had devoted his long life to meditation and tantra.\n\nSensing his mortality he worked feverishly to accomplish his works in \"saving\" the Khmer people and establishing a Buddhist empire in a race against time.\n\nIn 1177, the Cham Kingdom of central Vietnam had invaded and sacked Angkor, creating a sense of trauma and crisis throughout the Khmer Empire by attacking and looting the capital. King Jayavarman VII ascended the throne in a climate of crisis, and war.\n\nJayavarman VII was a Mahayana Buddhist, and he regarded himself to be a Dharma-king, a bodhisattva, whose duty was to \"save the people\" through service and merit-making, liberating himself in the process.\n\nScholars speculate why Khmer royalty rejected Hinduism and embraced Buddhism definitively at this time. Perhaps, they suggest, Jayavarman and his people had become disillusioned with the Hindu gods because of their failure to protect the Angkor Empire from being sacked by their enemies, the Cham. The Cham themselves were Hindu and worshiped Shiva, and the Khmer may have therefore felt an instinctive revulsion at the religion of their enemies.\n\nJayavarman withdrew his devotion from the old gods and began to identify more openly with Buddhist traditions. His regime marked a clear dividing line with the old Hindu past.\n\nBefore 1200, art in the temples mostly portrayed scenes from the Hindu pantheon such as Vishnu reclining on a lotus leaf, or the churning of the primeval sea of the milk of creation. After 1200, scenes from the Buddhist Jatakas, and life of the Buddha, along with scenes of the Ramayana began to appear as standard motif.\n\nAs a \"bodhisattva king\" Jayavarman VII was considered to be a living Buddha, or bodhisattva who turned his back from the brink of enlightenment to redeem or save his people from suffering; he imagined himself in a role similar to that of the present day Dalai Lama of Tibet.\n\nImages of Jayavarman portray him in the ascetic pose seated in meditation with a serene, enlightened expression. He built numerous public works to serve the people, including waterworks, hospitals, temples, hospices for travelers.\n\nStone inscriptions say he \"suffered from the maladies of his subjects more than from his own; for it is the public griefs that make a king's grief, and not his own.\"\n\nAnother inscription reads: \"Filled with a deep sympathy for the good of the world, the king swore this oath; 'All beings who are plunged in the ocean of existence, may I draw them out by virtue of this good work. And may the kings of Cambodia who come after me, attached to goodness...attain with their wives, dignitaries and friends, the place of deliverance where there is no more illness.'\"\n\nProfound psychological change was underway in Jayavarman VII's reign. There was a shift away from the cult of devaraja god-king, toward the cult of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the cult of monks. In former times, great effort and resources were invested into building temples for elite brahman priests and god-kings. Under Jayavarman, these resources were redirected to building libraries, monastic dwellings, public works, and more \"earthly\" projects accessible to the common people.\n\nHis temple, the [[Bayon]] in [[Angkor Thom]], is the first temple built without walls, indicating its openness to all the people, not exclusive to the god-king and his Brahmin priests. The walls of the Bayon are decorated with scenes from the daily life of the people fishing, eating, gambling and [[cock-fighting]], rather than the heroic deeds of gods and kings.\n\nKing Jayavarman considered the Bayon as his masterpiece, his \"bride.\" A stone inscription says \"the town of Yosadharapura, decorated with powder and jewels, burning with desire, the daughter of a good family...who married by the king in the course of a festival that lacked nothing, under the spreading dais of his \nprotection.\"\n\nThe purpose of this mystical marriage of King and people, the inscription goes on to say, was the \"procreation of happiness throughout the universe.\"\n\nThe building projects commissioned by Jayavarman were redolent with tantric Buddhist symbolism. The word \"bayon\" means \"ancestor [[yantra]]\" - a magic symbol of geometric shape of [[tantric Buddhism]]. In the center of the Bayon temple was an image of Buddha-[[Mucalinda]]: the Buddha sitting on a seven-headed cobra, with the serpent's hood unveiled above the Buddha as protection from the elements. The Buddha image has the features of Jayavarman VII himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nJayavarman other major temple projects included [[Preah Khan]] and [[Ta Prohm]].\n\nWhile Jayavarman VII himself was Mahayana Buddhist, the presence of Theravada Buddhism was increasingly evident. \"This Singhalese-based Theravada Buddhist orthodoxy was first propagated in Southeast Asia by Taling (Mon) monks in the 11th century and together with Islam in the 13th century in southern insular reaches of the region, spread as a popularly-based movement among the people. Apart from inscriptions, such as one of Lopburi, there were other signs that the religious  venue of Suvannabhumi were changing. Tamalinda, the Khmer monk believed to be the son of Jayavarman VII, took part in an 1180 Burmese-led mission to Sri Lanka to study the Pali canon and on his return in 1190 had adepts of the Sinhala doctrine in his court. Zhou Daguan, who led a Chinese mission into Angkor in 1296-97 confirms the significant presence of Pali Theravada monks in the Khmer Capital.\"<ref name=gyallay/>\n\n== Decline of Angkor &amp; the Emergence of a Theravada Kingdom ==\nAfter the 13th century Theravada Buddhism became the state religion of Cambodia.\n\nKing Jayavarman VII had sent his son Tamalinda to [[Sri Lanka]] to be ordained as a Buddhist monk and study Theravada Buddhism according to the [[Pali]] scriptural traditions. Tamalinda then returned to Cambodia and promoted Buddhist traditions according to the Theravada training he had received, galvanizing and energizing the long-standing Theravada presence that had existed throughout the Angkor empire for centuries.\n\nDuring the time Tamalinda studied at the famous [[Mahavihara]] Monastery in Sri Lanka (1180\u20131190), a new dynamic type of Theravada Buddhism was being preached as the \"true faith\" in Sri Lanka. This form of Buddhism was somewhat militant and highly disciplined in reaction to the wars with the Tamil that nearly destroyed Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 9th and 10th centuries.  As Theravada Buddhism struggled for survival in Sri Lanka, it developed a resiliency that generated a renaissance throughout the Buddhist world, and would eventually spread across Burma, Chang Mai, the Mon kingdoms, Lana, Sukothai, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=keyes>Keyes, Charles. ''The Golden Peninsula''.</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century, wandering missionaries from the Mon-Khmer-speaking parts of Siam, Burma, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka played an important part in this process.\n\nWhen Prince Tamalinda returned after ten years of ordination, he was a Thera, a senior monk, capable of administering ordination into this vigorous Theravada lineage, which insisted on orthodoxy and rejected Mahayana \"innovations\" such as tantric practices.\n\nSome scholars have argued that the transition from Mahayana to Theravada was more gradual than it was generally believed. French scholar Nicolas Revire has studied an Angkor stele, now at the [[Bangkok National Museum]], depicting as late as the 13th or 14th century the Mahayana image of Buddha\u2019s birth where Buddha emerges from his mother\u2019s side at the moment of delivery. Revire believes this suggests that a kind of Mahayana \u201cleftover \u2018behavior\u2019\u201d persisted even after the institutional transition to Theravada had been completed.<ref>Nicolas Revire, \u201c\u2018The Birth of the Buddha\u2019 at Angkor,\u201d ''Journal of the Siam Society'' 107, 2019, 63-90 (82).</ref>\n\n[[Image:BuddhistMonk01a.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Buddhist nun. [[Bayon]] Temple, Angkor Wat, Siem Reap, Cambodia (January 2005).]]\nThe mass conversion of Khmer society to Theravada Buddhism amounted to a [[nonviolent revolution]] every all level of society. All monumental building projects that had characterized the Angkor empire came to a sudden end. Scholars struggle to account for this sudden and inexplicable transformation of Khmer civilization.\n\nTheravada Buddhism succeeded because it was inclusive and universal in its outreach, recruiting the disciples and monks from not only the elites and court, but also in the villages and among the peasants, enhancing its popularity among the Khmer folk.\n\n\"Their message succeeded because it provided a meaningful way of relating to the world for many who had been marginal to the classical civilizations or who had been seriously affected by the disruption of the classical civilizations in the 13th and 14th centuries.\"<ref name=keyes/>\n\nJournalist Elizabeth Becker explained the phenomenon: \"Cambodians were ripe for conversion. The political integrity and morality of the kingdom were thrown into question at the time, and Cambodians converted en masse to this new faith that offered social tranquility without striving for material gain or power. The modest Buddhist bonzes were a welcome change from the arrogant and wealthy priests of the kings. The new Buddhists dressed in simple saffron robes. They possessed a sense of responsibility for all, not just the nobility. Eventually they became as revered as the devaraja, who in turn became a Theravada Buddhist himself as patron of the faith.\"<ref>Becker, Elizabeth. ''When the War Was Over''.</ref>\n\nOther scholars suggest that the classical Angkor Empire collapsed from desertion from within and assault from without, from growing external threats and assaults from Siam and Vietnam which were both in ascendancy at the time.\n\n\"The post-Angkor period saw the dramatic rise of the Pali Theravada tradition in Southeast Asia and concomitant decline of the Brahmanic and Mahayana Buddhist religious traditions. A 1423 Thai account of a mission to Sri Lanka mentions eight Khmer monks who again brought orthodox Mahavihara sect of Singhalese order to Kampuchea. This particular event belied, however, the profound societal shift that was taking place from priestly class structure to a village-based monastic system in Theravada lands. While adhering to the monastic discipline, monks developed their wats, or temple-monasteries, not only into moral religious but also education, social-service, and cultural centers for the people. Wats became the main source of learning and popular education. Early western explorers, settlers, and missionaries reported widespread literacy among the male populations of Burma, Thailand, Kampuchea, Laos, and Vietnam. Until the 19th century, literacy rates exceeded those of Europe in most if not all Theravada lands. In Kampuchea, Buddhism became the transmitter of Khmer language and culture.\"<ref name=gyallay/>\n\nThe Theravada revolution was therefor a grassroots movement of the Khmer people rejecting some of the oppressive practices of the god-king religion of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nWith the rise of Siam in the west and Vietnam in the east, the classical Angkor empire disappeared and the beginning of present-day Cambodia began. The center of government began to migrate away from Angkor to a more central location in the center of Cambodia, in the regions near present-day Phnom Penh.\n\nCambodia became from this time forward a Theravada Buddhist nation. \"Theravada Buddhism, unlike almost all the previous religions of the country, its doctrines were not imposed from above but were preached to the people. It was simple, required no expensive priesthood or temples and little ceremonial. Its missionaries practiced austerity, solitude, humility, and poverty. Their example and their direct contact with the people started to undermine the old state religion and the monastery which rested upon it. Theravada Buddhism remained the great belief and comfort of the Khmer people until 1975.\"<ref>Shawcross, William. ''Sideshow''.</ref>\n\nZhou Daguan, a Chinese visitor to the Royal Court of Cambodia at this time wrote of the presence of Theravada Buddhist monks in the latter days of Angkor.\n\nZhou Daguan was an emissary from the court of Timur Khan, Emperor of China. Daguan lived in Angkor Thom for one year 1296-7 and wrote a small book about his observations in which he described Theravada monks with shaved heads, yellow robes and one shoulder bare, walking barefoot throughout Cambodia. Their temples were simple, he said, containing one image of Sakyamuni Buddha. The image was draped in yellow cloth.\n\nThe Theravada monks ate meat or fish but did not drink wine. They ate only one meal a day. They did not cook in the temple, but lived on alms food.\n\n\"The books they recited from were very numerous. These were made of neatly bound palm leaves covered with black writing. Some of the monks were royal counselors, and therefore had the right to be conveyed in palanquins with gold shafts accompanied by umbrellas with gold or silver handles. There were no Buddhist nuns.\"<ref name=omurray/>\n\n== Middle Ages ==\n\nThe Jinakalamali gives an account of the cultural connections between Cambodia and Sri Lanka in the fifteenth century. It states that 1967<sup>(1967?? Perhaps 1697)</sup>  years after theMahaparinibbana of the Buddha, eight monks headed by Mahananasiddhi from Cambodia with 25 monks from Nabbispura in Thailand came to Sri Lanka to receive the umpasampada ordination at the hands of the Sinhalese Mahatheras.\n \nAs Angkor collapsed under the advancing jungles, the centre of power of the Theravada Cambodia moved south toward present day [[Phnom Penh]]. Phnom Penh was originally a small riverside market center where the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap River converge.\n\nPhnom Penh was founded when Lady Penh found a \"four-faced Buddha\" floating down the river on a Koki tree during the flooding season. She retrieved the Buddha image and had the Wat Phnom constructed to house the image. The four-faced Buddha [Buddha facing the four directions] is important in Khmer Buddhist iconography, signifying the establishment of the kingdom of the Buddha of the Future, [[Maitreya]], who is often identified with the Buddha-king of Cambodia.\n\nAfter 1431 when the Cambodian kings permanently abandoned Angkor due to a Siamese invasion, the royal court was located on Udon Mountain, a few kilometres north of Phnom Penh. Siamese incursions from the west and Vietnamese invasions from the east weakened the Khmer empire. The Vietnamese invaders attempted to suppress Theravada Buddhism and force the Khmer people to practice Mahayana Buddhism. The Siamese, on the other hand, would periodically invade Cambodia and attempt to drive out the \"unbelievers\" in an attempt to protect the Theravada religion. This power-struggle between the two ascendant powers continued until the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th century.\n\nBuddhism continued to flourish in Cambodia in the sixteenth century. King Ang Chan (1516\u20131566), a relative of King Dhammaraja, was a devout Buddhist. He built pagodas in his capital and many Buddhist shrines in different parts of Cambodia. In order to popularize Buddhism, King Satha (1576-1549), son and successor of King Barom Reachea, restored the great towers of the Angkor Wat, which had become a Buddhist shrine by the sixteenth century.\n\nWhen Western merchants and missionaries first made contact with Cambodia, they discovered a three-tiered society consisting of the nobility, the common people (who were primarily rice farmers), and the Buddhist monks who were custodians of Khmer culture and identity.\n\nEach successive wave of European influence was accompanied by Catholic missionaries, but Theravada Buddhism proved surprisingly resistant to foreign attempts to convert the Khmer people.\n\nIn 1556, the Portuguese missionary Gaspar de Cruz spent about a year in Cambodia and visited the capital at Lovek where King Cham reigned. The missionary complained bitterly of his inability to convert the Khmer people to Christianity, and blamed the Buddhist monks for his failure: The monks, he said, are \"exceedingly proud and vain...alive they are worshiped for gods, in so that the inferior among them do worship the superior like gods, praying unto them and prostrating themselves before them; and so the common people have great confidence in them, with great reverence and worship; so that there is no person that dare contradict them in anything... [It] happened sometimes that while I was preaching, many round me hearing me very well, and being very satisfied with what I told them, that if there came along any of these priests and said, 'This is good but ours is better,' they would all depart and leave me alone.'\"<ref>Chandler, David. ''A History of Cambodia''.</ref>\n\n== Colonial Era ==\nDuring the colonial period, the peace was periodically breached by outbreaks of religiously motivated violence.  Periodic millenarian revolts, often led by charismatic monks or self-proclaimed holy men.  In 1820-21, a Millennial uprising was led by a former monk named Kai, who was recognized as a holy man with supernatural powers. He organized a revolt against the Vietnamese overlords from his hideout in Ba Phanom.\n\nDuring the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, Thailand's involvement in Cambodian politics extended Thai influence into religious matters as well.  In 1855, King [[Norodom]] invited monks from the Thai [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] to establish a Dhammayuttika presence in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=83}}</ref>  Maha Pan, a Khmer monk who had studied under some of the same teachers as Thailand's [[Mongkut]], was appointed the first [[sangharaja]] of the new Khmer Dhammayuttika tradition (usually referred to as 'Thommayut'), taking up residence at Wat Botum Vaddey, a new temple built adjacent to the palace in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\"/>\n\nThe newly formed Thommayut order benefited from royal patronage, but frequently came into conflict with the existing Mohanikay (Mahanikaya) lineage.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 83\"/>  The Thommayut were sometimes accused of holding loyalty to the Thai court, rather than to the Khmer nation.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|pp=83\u20134}}</ref>\n\nCambodia was recognized by the West as a \"protectorate\" of France in 1867.<ref>{{Harv|Wyatt|2003|p=180}}</ref>  Over the course of the next forty years, the territory of modern Cambodia was integrated as a colony into French Indo-China through a series of \"protective\" agreements with the Vietnamese, and treaty concessions from [[Thailand]].<ref>{{Harv|Wyatt|2003|pp=189\u201391}}</ref>  Periodic convulsions of violence, led by Buddhist holy men, would periodically break out against the French.\n\nDuring the era of French rule, significant advances were made in the education of Cambodian monks, both in specifically Buddhist topics and more general studies.  In Phnom Penh, a Pali high school for monks was created in 1914, and later converted into a college.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 p\">{{Harv|Rajavaramuni|1984|p=}}</ref>  This four-year diploma granting program for monks included not only education in the Pali language and Buddhist canon, but also basic education in modern, secular topics.<ref name=\"Bapat 1959\">{{Harv|Bapat|Takasaki|1959}}</ref>  Beginning in 1933, elementary Pali schools were established to provide new monks with a shorter introduction to Pali.<ref name=\"Bapat 1959\"/>  These schools eventually developed into broader monastic schools, where all monks were given basic education in the dhamma-vinaya.<ref name=\"Bapat 1959\"/>  In 1961, a Buddhist university, the Buddhist University of Phra Sihanu-Raja began instruction.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 p\"/>\n\nPrimary education of Cambodian children continued to take place at temple schools.  Monks were also encouraged to become involved in community development projects.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 p\"/>\n\n== Khmer Rouge Era ==\nIn 1975 when the communist Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia, they tried to completely destroy Buddhism and very nearly succeeded. By the time of the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, nearly every monk and religious intellectual had been either murdered or driven into exile, and nearly every temple and Buddhist temple and library had been destroyed.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge policies towards Buddhism- which included the forcible disrobing of monks, the destruction of monasteries, and, ultimately, the execution of uncooperative monks effectively destroyed Cambodia's Buddhist institutions.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=74}}</ref>  Monks who did not flee and avoided execution lived among the laity, sometimes secretly performing Buddhist rituals for the sick or afflicted.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\"/>\n\nEstimates vary regarding the number of monks in Cambodia prior to the ascension of the Khmer Rouge, ranging between 65,000 and 80,000.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 78\u201382\">{{Harv|Rajavaramuni|1984|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>  By the time of the Buddhist restoration in the early 1980s, the number of Cambodian monks worldwide was estimated to be less than 3,000.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\u20136\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|pp=75\u20136}}</ref>  The patriarchs of both Cambodian [[nikaya]]s perished sometime during the period 1975-78, though the cause of their deaths is not known.<ref name=\"Rajavaramuni 1984 78\u201382\"/>\n\nDue to their association with the Thai monarchy, monks of the Thommayut order may have been particularly targeted for persecution.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=84}}</ref>\n\n== Vietnamese Occupation ==\nFollowing the defeat of the Khmer Rouge by forces of the Vietnamese government, Buddhism initially remained officially suppressed within Cambodia.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 74\"/>  Following challenges to the legitimacy of the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, policies towards Buddhism began to liberalize starting in the summer of 1979.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\">{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=75}}</ref>  A group of monks who had been exiled and re-ordained in Vietnam during the Khmer Rouge period were sent to Cambodia,<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=93}}</ref> and in 1981 one of their number, Venerable Tep Vong, was elected the first [[sangharaja]] of a new unified Cambodia sangha, officially abolishing the division between the Thommayut order and the Mohanikay.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\"/>  The ordination of new monks was sponsored by the government as a public show of piety and lifted restrictions on ordination.<ref name=\"Harris 2001 75\u20136\"/>\n\n== Modern Era ==\nToday Buddhism is struggling to re-establish itself although the lack of Buddhist scholars and leaders and the continuing political instability makes the task difficult.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Vietnamese military, the newly renamed [[Cambodian People's Party]] sought to align itself with the Buddhist sangha, declaring Buddhism to be Cambodia's 'state religion' in a 1991 policy statement<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=76}}</ref>  In 1991, King [[Sihanouk]] returned from exile and appointed a new [[sangharaja]] for each of the Thommayut and Mohanikay orders, effectively marking the end of the unified system created under Vietnamese rule in 1981.<ref>{{Harv|Harris|2001|p=77}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n\n{{Asia topic|Buddhism in}}\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Cambodia topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Buddhism In Cambodia}}\n[[Category:Buddhism in Cambodia|.]]\n[[Category:History of Buddhism by country|Cambodia]]\n[[Category:History of Cambodia|Buddhism]]\n[[Category:Social history of Cambodia|Buddhism]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 586-664 \u2192 586\u2013664, \u2019s \u2192 's (2), 500-700 \u2192 500\u2013700 (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Buddhism_in_Cambodia"}

He had a wife and son in Exeter and had worked in England for seven years when, at Exeter Assizes on 20 March 1786, he was sentenced to transportation for seven years for stealing eleven screw bolts and other goods from [[Powderham Castle]]. He was held on the ''Dunkirk'' hulk for almost a year, and was embarked upon ''Charlotte'' on 11 March 1787, by which he was transported to New South Wales. Martin was apparently a useful tradesman in Sydney, and his narrative \u2013 known as the ''Memorandoms of James Martin'' \u2013 is the only extant first-hand account written by a First Fleet convict.<ref name=\"Memorandoms of James Martin\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Martin | first = James | author-link = James Martin (convict)\n | editor-last = Causer | editor-first = Tim \n | title = Memorandoms\n | publisher = UCL Press\n | orig-year = c1793\n | date = 2017\n | url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-press/browse-books/memorandoms-of-james-martin\n | isbn = 9781911576839 }}</ref>\n\nOn the night of 28 March 1791, Martin, along with [[William Bryant (convict)|William Bryant]], his wife [[Mary Bryant|Mary]] (n\u00e9e Broad) and their two children Charlotte and Emanuel, William Allen, Samuel Bird, Samuel Broom, James Cox, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton, stole the colony's six-oared open boat. In this vessel, the party navigated the eastern and northern coasts of Australia, survived several ferocious storms, encountered Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and reached [[Kupang]] in Dutch West Timor on 5 June 1791, the entire party having survived. There, they successfully \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 passed themselves off as the survivors of a shipwreck.\n\nOnce their true identities were discovered, the escapees were imprisoned and returned to England. During this journey, William Bryant, Emanuel Bryant, James Cox, Samuel Bird, and William Morton died. The survivors arrived back in England on 18 June 1792. On 7 July they were brought to the bar at the [[Old Bailey]], and ordered to remain in [[Newgate gaol]] until their original sentences of transportation had expired. Mary Bryant received an unconditional pardon on 2 May 1793 when her sentence expired, while Martin, Allen, Broom, and Lillie were released by proclamation on 2 November 1793. From there, they largely disappear from the historical record.\n\nThe ''Memorandoms'' is part of the [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham Papers]] archive in [[University College London]] Library's Special Collections. It was first discovered by the Bentham scholar Charles Blount, who in 1937 published a short edition, limited to 150 copies.<ref name=\"Memorandoms of James Martin\"/> In 2017, an open-access book, containing reproductions of the original manuscript and a detailed introduction, edited by Tim Causer, was published by UCL Press.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Borrowdale (1785 ship)|Borrowdale]]''\n*{{ship||Fishburn|1780 ship|2}}\n*{{ship||Golden Grove|1782 ship|2}}\n*[[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|title=Buried alive : Sydney 1788\u20131792 : eyewitness accounts of the making of a nation|first=Jack|last=Egan|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=1999|isbn=9781865081380}}\n* {{Cite book|title=The First Fleet: the real story|first=Alan|last=Frost|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2012|isbn=9781863955614}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Arthur Phillip|first=Derek|last=Parker|publisher=Woodslane Press|year=2009|isbn=9781921203992}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Arthur Phillip: Sailor, Mercenary, Governor, Spy|first=Michael|last=Pembroke|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|year=2013|isbn=9781742705088}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Lord Sydney : the life and times of Tommy Townshend|first=Andrew|last=Tink|publisher=Australian Scholarly Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781921875434}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a1085.html ''A Journal of a Voyage from Portsmouth to New South Wales and China \u2013 in the Lady Penrhyn, Merchantman \u2013 William Cropton Sever, Commander'' by Arthur Bowes, Smyth, Surgeon \u2013 1787-1788-1789]\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a138.html ''A Voyage to New South Wales'' by William Bradley]\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a262.html ''Journal kept on the Friendship during a voyage to Botany Bay and Norfolk Island; and on the Gorgon returning to England, 9 March 1787 \u2013 31 December 1787, 1 January 1788 \u2013 10 March 1788, 15 February 1790 \u2013 2 January 1791, 25 January 1791 \u2013 17 June 1792'' by Ralph Clark]\n* [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00010.html ''An Account of the English Colony of NSW Vol 1'' by David Collins, at Project Gutenberg]\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a1145.html ''Pt Jno Easty A Memorandum of the Transa() of a Voiage (sic) from England to Botany Bay in The Scarborough transport Captn Marshall Commander kept by me your humble Servan() John Easty marine wich (sic) began 1787'' by John Easty]\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a1518.html ''Journal kept on board the Sirius during a voyage to New South Wales, May 1787 \u2013 March 1791'' by John Hunter]\n* [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2007/D00007/a1519.html ''Remarks & Journal kept on the Expedition to form a Colony ...'' by Philip Gidley King]\n* [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-press/browse-books/memorandoms-of-james-martin ''Memorandoms by James Martin: An Astonishing Escape from Early New South Wales'', ed.

At least 12 people on the fleet kept a journal of their experiences, some of which were later published, while others wrote letters home during the voyage or soon after their arrival in Australia. These personal accounts of the voyage were made by people including surgeons, officers, soldiers, ordinary seamen, and Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], who commanded the expedition. Only one known account, that of [[James Martin (convict)|James Martin]], was by a transported convict. Their journals document the day-to-day experiences of those in the fleet, and record significant events including the first contact between the European settlers and the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] of the area.

Martin was apparently a useful tradesman in Sydney, and his narrative \u2013 known as the ''Memorandoms of James Martin'' \u2013 is the only extant first-hand account written by a First Fleet convict.<ref name=\"Memorandoms of James Martin\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Martin | first = James | author-link = James Martin (convict)\n | editor-last = Causer | editor-first = Tim \n | title = Memorandoms\n | publisher = UCL Press\n | orig-year = c1793\n | date = 2017\n | url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-press/browse-books/memorandoms-of-james-martin\n | isbn = 9781911576839 }}</ref>\n\nOn the night of 28 March 1791, Martin, along with [[William Bryant (convict)|William Bryant]], his wife [[Mary Bryant|Mary]] (n\u00e9e Broad) and their two children Charlotte and Emanuel, William Allen, Samuel Bird, Samuel Broom, James Cox, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton, stole the colony's six-oared open boat. In this vessel, the party navigated the eastern and northern coasts of Australia, survived several ferocious storms, encountered Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and reached [[Kupang]] in Dutch West Timor on 5 June 1791, the entire party having survived. There, they successfully \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 passed themselves off as the survivors of a shipwreck.\n\nOnce their true identities were discovered, the escapees were imprisoned and returned to England. During this journey, William Bryant, Emanuel Bryant, James Cox, Samuel Bird, and William Morton died. The survivors arrived back in England on 18 June 1792. On 7 July they were brought to the bar at the [[Old Bailey]], and ordered to remain in [[Newgate gaol]] until their original sentences of transportation had expired. Mary Bryant received an unconditional pardon on 2 May 1793 when her sentence expired, while Martin, Allen, Broom, and Lillie were released by proclamation on 2 November 1793. From there, they largely disappear from the historical record.\n\nThe ''Memorandoms'' is part of the [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham Papers]] archive in [[University College London]] Library's Special Collections.

Page Brown]], at 56 Bayard Lane, [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in the [[Princeton Historic District (Princeton, New Jersey)|Princeton Historic District]]]]\n\nThe Shingle style in America was made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture, which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the [[Eastlake Movement|Eastlake style]]. In the Shingle style, English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial. Architects emulated colonial houses' plain, shingled surfaces as well as their massing, whether in the simple gable of McKim Mead and White's [[William D. Low House|Low House]] or in the complex massing of [[Kragsyde]], which looked almost as if a colonial house had been fancifully expanded over many years. This impression of the passage of time was enhanced by the use of shingles. Some architects, in order to attain a weathered look on a new building, even had the cedar shakes dipped in buttermilk, dried and then installed, to leave a grayish tinge to the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThe Shingle style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume. This effect\u2014of the building as an envelope of space, rather than a great mass, was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces, the horizontal shape of many shingle-style houses, and the emphasis on horizontal continuity, both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses.\n\n[[McKim, Mead and White]] and [[Peabody and Stearns]] were two of the notable firms of the era that helped to popularize the shingle style, through their large-scale commissions for \"seaside cottages\" of the rich and the well-to-do in such places as Newport, Rhode Island. However, the most famous Shingle-style house built in America was \"[[Kragsyde]]\" (1882), the summer home commissioned by Bostonian G. Nixon Black, from Peabody and Stearns. Kragsyde was built atop the rocky coastal shore near [[Manchester-By-the-Sea, Massachusetts]], and embodied every possible tenet of the shingle style.\n\nMany of the concepts of the Shingle style were adopted by [[Gustav Stickley]], and adapted to the American version of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].\n\n==Canada==\n{{Main|Category:Queen Anne architecture in Canada}}\n\n==Australia==\n{{Main|Federation architecture}}\nIn Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the Federation style, which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]], derived from the influence of [[Richard Norman Shaw]],<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132</ref> an influential British architect of the late [[Victorian era]]. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|left|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the [[Federation Queen Anne]] house that were to become so popular.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a strong Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian elements like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the [[Federation Queen Anne]] style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring prominent verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n[[File:Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Polo, Pilar.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pando-Carabassa House (1900), Pilar, Buenos Aires, headquarters of the [[Argentine Polo Association]].]]\n\n==Argentina==\n{{further|Architecture of Argentina}}\nExamples include the [[Villa Ocampo]] (1891) in [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires]]; and the Pando-Carabassa House (1900), in [[Pilar, Buenos Aires]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Victorian architectural styles|Category:Victorian architectural styles]]\n*[[:Category:Victorian architecture in the United States|Category:Victorian architecture in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|position=left|Queen Anne Revival architecture}}\n\n{{Revivals}}\n{{Architecture in the United States}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Queen Anne architecture in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Queen Anne architecture| United States]]\n[[Category:American architectural styles|Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:Victorian architecture in the United States| Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:Victorian architectural styles|Queen Anne U.S.]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places architecture categories]]\n[[Category:Shingle Style architecture|.Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:19th-century architecture in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 18th century [[English Baroque]] style|Queen Anne style architecture}}\n[[File:TorringtonGEDC0242_JamesAlldisHouse_sm.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Alldis House]] in Connecticut]]\nThe '''Queen Anne Revival'''<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/art/Queen-Anne-Revival Queen Anne Revival architecture,] from Encyclopedia Britannica.</ref> was a [[historicist]] architectural style of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.

Some architects, in order to attain a weathered look on a new building, even had the cedar shakes dipped in buttermilk, dried and then installed, to leave a grayish tinge to the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThe Shingle style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume. This effect\u2014of the building as an envelope of space, rather than a great mass, was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces, the horizontal shape of many shingle-style houses, and the emphasis on horizontal continuity, both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses.\n\n[[McKim, Mead and White]] and [[Peabody and Stearns]] were two of the notable firms of the era that helped to popularize the shingle style, through their large-scale commissions for \"seaside cottages\" of the rich and the well-to-do in such places as Newport, Rhode Island. However, the most famous Shingle-style house built in America was \"[[Kragsyde]]\" (1882), the summer home commissioned by Bostonian G. Nixon Black, from Peabody and Stearns. Kragsyde was built atop the rocky coastal shore near [[Manchester-By-the-Sea, Massachusetts]], and embodied every possible tenet of the shingle style.\n\nMany of the concepts of the Shingle style were adopted by [[Gustav Stickley]], and adapted to the American version of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].\n\n==Canada==\n{{Main|Category:Queen Anne architecture in Canada}}\n\n==Australia==\n{{Main|Federation architecture}}\nIn Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the Federation style, which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]], derived from the influence of [[Richard Norman Shaw]],<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132</ref> an influential British architect of the late [[Victorian era]]. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|left|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the [[Federation Queen Anne]] house that were to become so popular.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a strong Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian elements like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the [[Federation Queen Anne]] style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring prominent verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n[[File:Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Polo, Pilar.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pando-Carabassa House (1900), Pilar, Buenos Aires, headquarters of the [[Argentine Polo Association]].]]\n\n==Argentina==\n{{further|Architecture of Argentina}}\nExamples include the [[Villa Ocampo]] (1891) in [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires]]; and the Pando-Carabassa House (1900), in [[Pilar, Buenos Aires]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Victorian architectural styles|Category:Victorian architectural styles]]\n*[[:Category:Victorian architecture in the United States|Category:Victorian architecture in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|position=left}}\n\n{{Revivals}}\n{{Architecture in the United States}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Queen Anne architecture in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Queen Anne architecture| United States]]\n[[Category:American architectural styles|Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:Victorian architecture in the United States| Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:Victorian architectural styles|Queen Anne U.S.]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places architecture categories]]\n[[Category:Shingle Style architecture|.Queen Anne]]\n[[Category:19th-century architecture in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Blairall", "label": "safe", "comment": "revised my edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Anne_Revival_architecture"}

The county was probably named in honor of the [[Duke of Buckingham]], though the precise origin is uncertain.  Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51029.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>  Buckingham is part of the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] [[Charlottesville, Virginia metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n== History ==\nBuckingham County, lying south of the [[James River]] and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]. The origin of the county name probably comes from the [[Duke of Buckingham]] ([[Buckinghamshire, England]]). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate \"Buckingham,\" which was located on Willis Creek.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Salmon|first1=edited by Emily J.|last2=Campbell, Jr|first2=Edward D.C.|title=The Hornbook of Virginia History : a ready-reference guide to the Old Dominion's people, places, and past|date=1994|publisher=Library of Virginia|location=Richmond|isbn=0884901777|pages=162|edition=4th}}</ref> This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.\n\nIn 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to [[Cumberland County, Virginia|Cumberland County]]. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of [[Appomattox County, Virginia|Appomattox County]]. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic [[slave trade]] to the [[Deep South]], where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, Joe Thompson bought the Buckingham Mill.  In 1945 he put into place the long system of utilizing grain which used sifters as the grain was ground. Seven years later he added grain elevators. This was the last mill to make flour in Buckingham County and represents a time when America relied on the small farm and small business owner.<ref>Pennington, M. & Scott, L. (1977). The Courthouse Burned: Buckingham County. Waynesboro: McClung.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers.  It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting.  The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia.  Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to [[Huguenot#North America|French Huguenots]], who resettled from [[London]], England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at [[Appomattox, Virginia]]. A marker in the cemetery of [http://www.christparish.org/Trinity.htm Trinity Presbyterian Church] in New Canton reads,\n\n<blockquote>According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays [[United Daughters of the Confederacy|UDC]] Chapter #1877  2003.</blockquote>\n\nIn 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.<ref>Yeck, Joanne L.

The county was probably named in honor of the [[Duke of Buckingham]], though the precise origin is uncertain.  Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51029.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>  Buckingham is part of the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] [[Charlottesville, Virginia metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n== History ==\nBuckingham County, lying south of the [[James River]] and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]. The origin of the county name probably comes from the [[Duke of Buckingham]] ([[Buckinghamshire, England]]). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate \"Buckingham,\" which was located on Willis Creek.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Salmon|first1=edited by Emily J.|last2=Campbell, Jr|first2=Edward D.C.|title=The Hornbook of Virginia History : a ready-reference guide to the Old Dominion's people, places, and past|date=1994|publisher=Library of Virginia|location=Richmond|isbn=0884901777|pages=162|edition=4th}}</ref> This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.\n\nIn 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to [[Cumberland County, Virginia|Cumberland County]]. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of [[Appomattox County, Virginia|Appomattox County]]. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic [[slave trade]] to the [[Deep South]], where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, Joe Thompson bought the Buckingham Mill.  In 1945 he put into place the long system of utilizing grain which used sifters as the grain was ground. Seven years later he added grain elevators. This was the last mill to make flour in Buckingham County and represents a time when America relied on the small farm and small business owner.<ref>Pennington, M. & Scott, L. (1977). The Courthouse Burned: Buckingham County. Waynesboro: McClung.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers.  It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting.  The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia.  Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to [[Huguenot#North America|French Huguenots]], who resettled from [[London]], England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at [[Appomattox, Virginia]]. A marker in the cemetery of [http://www.christparish.org/Trinity.htm Trinity Presbyterian Church] in New Canton reads,\n\n<blockquote>According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays [[United Daughters of the Confederacy|UDC]] Chapter #1877  2003.</blockquote>\n\nIn 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.<ref>Yeck, Joanne L.

He was born at Barnbarroch House, south east of [[Castle Douglas]].\n\nPatrick studied Divinity, and became [[Rector (politics)|rector]] of [[Wigton]]. In 1568 he succeeded to the family estates on the death of his elder brother, and on 1 January 1576 he was appointed an ordinary [[lord of session]] on the spiritual side with the title of '''Lord Barnbarroch'''.

They hired John Gardiner's ship, the ''Lion of Leith''. Barnbarroch wrote a journal of this mission, mentioning his arrival at [[Elsinore]] on 8 June 1587 and stay with [[Richard Wedderburn]]. The next day he was met by the Captain of [[Kronborg]] and the Toll Master of the Sound, \"Phalrik Boyall\".

When they reached Antvorskov, with a wagon train provided by the king, David Myrtone, a relation of the Laird of [[Cambo Estate|Cambo in Fife]], was sent ahead to the Chancellor [[Niels Kaas]] because he could speak German. Kaas told them that Frederick II was ill with toothache, and they spoke to [[Manderup Parsberg]] and Henrik Below, saying that only had commission to speak with the king.

Jackson developed {{convert|10|mi}} of the Buckeye Canal from 1884 to 1886, which he named after his home state of Ohio's moniker, \"The Buckeye State\". The town was founded in 1888 and originally named \"[[Sidney, Ohio|Sidney]]\", after Jackson's home town in Ohio. However, because of the significance of the canal, the town became known as Buckeye. The name was legally changed to Buckeye in 1910. The town was incorporated in 1929, at which time it included {{convert|440|acres}}. The town's first mayor was Hugh M. Watson (1956\u20131958), who founded the Buckeye Valley Bank. Today, Watson Road is the site of the city's commercial center.<ref name=\"buckeyeaz.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyeaz.gov/index.aspx?nid%3D66 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171254/http://www.buckeyeaz.gov/index.aspx?nid=66 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Buckeye was featured on ''[[PBS NewsHour|The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' as part of a week-long series entitled \"Blueprint America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/reports/america-in-gridlock/video-nowhere-to-grow/3/|title=America in Gridlock ~ [VIDEO] Nowhere to Grow - Blueprint America - PBS|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}</ref>\n\nA vote to change the town into the City of Buckeye became effective in 2014.<ref>[http://www.cbs5az.com/story/23892802/buckeye-voters-change-name-from-town-to-city \"Buckeye officially changes name from 'town' to 'city'\"], cbs5az.com</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, population estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau placed Buckeye as the fastest growing city in the United States by percentage from 2017\u20132018, growing by 8.5%. <ref>https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2019/05/23/phoenix-and-buckeye-fastest-growing-cities-u-s/1204621001/</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBuckeye is located approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} west of downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|145.8|sqmi|sqkm|1}}, all of it land.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nThe original Buckeye was built around downtown's main street, Monroe Avenue. There are currently nearly 30 [[Planned community|master planned communities]] planned for Buckeye.  Such master planned communities under development in which homes are occupied include Riata West, Sundance, [[Verrado]], Westpark, [[Tartesso]] and Festival Ranch.\n\nOther unbuilt planned communities within Buckeye include [[Douglas Ranch, Buckeye|Douglas Ranch]] (planned for nearly 300,000 inhabitants), Sun Valley Villages, Spurlock Ranch, [[Trillium in Buckeye|Trillium]], Elianto, Westwind, Silver Rock, Sienna Hills, Henry Park, Southwest Ranch and Montierre.\n\n[[Sundance Towne Center]], a shopping center developed by Vestar Development in the Sundance community, opened in 2007.\n\n===Climate===\nBuckeye has a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BWh''), with abundant sunshine due to the stable descending air of the eastern side of the [[subtropical anticyclone]] aloft and at sea level over the southwestern United States. Summers, as with most of the [[Sonoran Desert]], are extremely hot, with 121.0 afternoons reaching {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}} and 181.6 afternoons getting to {{convert|90|F|C|1|disp=or}}. The record high temperature of {{convert|128|F|C|1}} occurred on July 28, 1995, and temperatures above {{convert|86|F|C|disp=or}} may occur in any month. Less hot weather may occasionally occur during summer, but such periods are no less unpleasant as they result from [[North American Monsoon|monsoonal]] weather with its attendant higher cloudiness and [[humidity]]; however actual rainfall from the monsoon is much more infrequent than in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] or even [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. The heaviest daily rainfall has been {{convert|4.90|in|mm|1}} on September 2, 1894, but between 1971 and 2000 no month had more rainfall than {{convert|4.52|in|mm|1|disp=or}} in December 1984.\n\nThe winter season from November to March is warm to very warm during the day, not much cooler than {{convert|68|F|C|disp=or}} during a typical afternoon, but 20.2 mornings typically fall to or below {{convert|32|F|C|disp=or}}, though no snowfall was recorded during the 1971 to 2000 period, and only twelve afternoons did not reach {{convert|50|F|disp=or}}.

The town was founded in 1888 and originally named \"[[Sidney, Ohio|Sidney]]\", after Jackson's home town in Ohio. However, because of the significance of the canal, the town became known as Buckeye. The name was legally changed to Buckeye in 1910. The town was incorporated in 1929, at which time it included {{convert|440|acres}}. The town's first mayor was Hugh M. Watson (1956\u20131958), who founded the Buckeye Valley Bank. Today, Watson Road is the site of the city's commercial center.<ref name=\"buckeyeaz.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyeaz.gov/index.aspx?nid%3D66 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171254/http://www.buckeyeaz.gov/index.aspx?nid=66 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Buckeye was featured on ''[[PBS NewsHour|The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' as part of a week-long series entitled \"Blueprint America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/reports/america-in-gridlock/video-nowhere-to-grow/3/|title=America in Gridlock ~ [VIDEO] Nowhere to Grow - Blueprint America - PBS|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}</ref>\n\nA vote to change the town into the City of Buckeye became effective in 2014.<ref>[http://www.cbs5az.com/story/23892802/buckeye-voters-change-name-from-town-to-city \"Buckeye officially changes name from 'town' to 'city'\"], cbs5az.com</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, population estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau placed Buckeye as the fastest growing city in the United States by percentage from 2017-2018, growing by 8.5%. <ref>https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2019/05/23/phoenix-and-buckeye-fastest-growing-cities-u-s/1204621001/</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBuckeye is located approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} west of downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|145.8|sqmi|sqkm|1}}, all of it land.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nThe original Buckeye was built around downtown's main street, Monroe Avenue.

Such master planned communities under development in which homes are occupied include Riata West, Sundance, [[Verrado]], Westpark, [[Tartesso]] and Festival Ranch.\n\nOther unbuilt planned communities within Buckeye include [[Douglas Ranch, Buckeye|Douglas Ranch]] (planned for nearly 300,000 inhabitants), Sun Valley Villages, Spurlock Ranch, [[Trillium in Buckeye|Trillium]], Elianto, Westwind, Silver Rock, Sienna Hills, Henry Park, Southwest Ranch and Montierre.\n\n[[Sundance Towne Center]], a shopping center developed by Vestar Development in the Sundance community, opened in 2007.\n\n===Climate===\nBuckeye has a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BWh''), with abundant sunshine due to the stable descending air of the eastern side of the [[subtropical anticyclone]] aloft and at sea level over the southwestern United States.

The record high temperature of {{convert|128|F|C|1}} occurred on July 28, 1995, and temperatures above {{convert|86|F|C|disp=or}} may occur in any month. Less hot weather may occasionally occur during summer, but such periods are no less unpleasant as they result from [[North American Monsoon|monsoonal]] weather with its attendant higher cloudiness and [[humidity]]; however actual rainfall from the monsoon is much more infrequent than in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] or even [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. The heaviest daily rainfall has been {{convert|4.90|in|mm|1}} on September 2, 1894, but between 1971 and 2000 no month had more rainfall than {{convert|4.52|in|mm|1|disp=or}} in December 1984.\n\nThe winter season from November to March is warm to very warm during the day, not much cooler than {{convert|68|F|C|disp=or}} during a typical afternoon, but 20.2 mornings typically fall to or below {{convert|32|F|C|disp=or}}, though no snowfall was recorded during the 1971 to 2000 period, and only twelve afternoons did not reach {{convert|50|F|disp=or}}.

A total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|previous season]]'s champions [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] successfully defending their title, finishing the season three points clear of runners-up [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]].\n\nThe season began on 17 August 1974 and concluded on 29 June 1975. This was the second national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to three consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973 and 1974. In the following seasons Ivi\u0107 won the 1976 cup and the [[1978\u201379 Yugoslav First League|1978\u201379 championship]] with Hajduk, becoming the most successful manager in club's history.\n\nStrikers [[Bo\u0161ko \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]] of [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] shared the title of top goalscorer with 20 goals each. Both players topped the scoring table for the first time in their careers, with Savi\u0107 repeating the achievement in the 1978\u201379 season.<!--\n\nThis was also one of only two seasons between 1946 and 1991 in which the Yugoslav Cup was not contested. The 1974\u201375 edition was skipped because the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] decided to change the usual cup schedule and move the date of cup finals from late November (usually played on or around [[Republic Day#November 29 in former Yugoslavia (1945\u20131990)|Republic Day]] (''Dan republike''), the holiday once celebrated on [[29 November]] which marked the anniversary of the establishment of communist Yugoslavia) to May, to coincide with [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Youth Day]] and the accompanying [[Relay of Youth]] celebrated on [[25 May]], which was also the birthday of [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\nFor this reason, the previous season's cup runners-up, [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]], entered the [[1975\u201376 European Cup Winners' Cup]], despite the fact that they spent the 1974\u201375 league season in second level.-->\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1973\u201374 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] and [[NK Zagreb]] were relegated from the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. Borac had completed a four-year stay at the highest level of Yugoslav football, while NK Zagreb had to return to second level after only one year in top flight.\n\nThe two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Radni\u010dki Kragujevac]] and [[NK Rijeka]]. Radni\u010dki Kragujevac returned to the highest division as winners of YSL Division East after spending two years in second level, which had ended their previous 1969\u20131972 three-season spell. In comparison, [[Croatia]]n side NK Rijeka returned as winners of YSL Division West after four years in second level, which had interrupted their earlier 1958\u20131969 eleven-year top level tenure. NK Rijeka would go on to remain in top flight until the [[1990\u201391 Yugoslav First League|1990\u201391 season]], when Croatian and Slovenian clubs abandoned the Yugoslav league amid the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!width=\"130\"| Team\n!width=\"100\"| Location\n!width=\"200\"| [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Federal

A total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|previous season]]'s champions [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] successfully defending their title, finishing the season three points clear of runners-up [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]].\n\nThe season began on 17 August 1974 and concluded on 29 June 1975. This was the second national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to three consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973 and 1974. In the following seasons Ivi\u0107 won the 1976 cup and the [[1978\u201379 Yugoslav First League|1978\u201379 championship]] with Hajduk, becoming the most successful manager in club's history.\n\nStrikers [[Bo\u0161ko \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]] of [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] shared the title of top goalscorer with 20 goals each. Both players topped the scoring table for the first time in their careers, with Savi\u0107 repeating the achievement in the 1978\u201379 season.<!--\n\nThis was also one of only two seasons between 1946 and 1991 in which the Yugoslav Cup was not contested. The 1974\u201375 edition was skipped because the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] decided to change the usual cup schedule and move the date of cup finals from late November (usually played on or around [[Republic Day#November 29 in former Yugoslavia (1945\u20131990)|Republic Day]] (''Dan republike''), the holiday once celebrated on [[29 November]] which marked the anniversary of the establishment of communist Yugoslavia) to May, to coincide with [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Youth Day]] and the accompanying [[Relay of Youth]] celebrated on [[25 May]], which was also the birthday of [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\nFor this reason, the previous season's cup runners-up, [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]], entered the [[1975\u201376 European Cup Winners' Cup]], despite the fact that they spent the 1974\u201375 league season in second level.-->\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1973\u201374 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] and [[NK Zagreb]] were relegated from the [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. Borac had completed a four-year stay at the highest level of Yugoslav football, while NK Zagreb had to return to second level after only one year in top flight.\n\nThe two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Radni\u010dki Kragujevac]] and [[NK Rijeka]]. Radni\u010dki Kragujevac returned to the highest division as winners of YSL Division East after spending two years in second level, which had ended their previous 1969\u20131972 three-season spell. In comparison, [[Croatia]]n side NK Rijeka returned as winners of YSL Division West after four years in second level, which had interrupted their earlier 1958\u20131969 eleven-year top level tenure. NK Rijeka would go on to remain in top flight until the [[1990\u201391 Yugoslav First League|1990\u201391 season]], when Croatian and Slovenian clubs abandoned the Yugoslav league amid the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!width=\"130\"| Team\n!width=\"100\"| Location\n!width=\"200\"| [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Federal
