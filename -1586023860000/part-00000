The Steelers defeated the Seahawks by the score of 21\u201310. The game was played on February 5, 2006, at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It is currently the last Super Bowl broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the first where all aspects of the game itself were aired in HD.<ref name=broadcastingcable/>\n\nWith the win, the Steelers tied the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] with the then-record five [[Super Bowl]]s. The Steelers' victory was their first Super Bowl victory since [[Super Bowl XIV]].  Pittsburgh, who finished the regular season with an 11\u20135 record, also became the fourth [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team, the third in nine years, and the first ever number 6 seed in the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]], to win a Super Bowl. The Seahawks, on the other hand, in their 30th season, were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an NFC-best 13\u20133 regular season record.\n\nPittsburgh capitalized on two big plays that were converted into touchdowns. The Steelers jumped to a 14\u20133 lead early in the third quarter with running back [[Willie Parker]]'s Super Bowl record 75-yard touchdown run. Seahawks defensive back [[Kelly Herndon]]'s Super Bowl record 76-yard interception return set up a Seattle touchdown to cut the lead 14\u201310. But Pittsburgh responded with [[Antwaan Randle El]]'s 43-yard touchdown pass to [[Hines Ward]], the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, to clinch the game in the fourth quarter. Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named [[Super Bowl MVP]].\n\nThe [[#Reaction to officiating|officiating in Super Bowl XL]] was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game, leading [[NFL Films]] to rank it as one of the top ten controversial calls of all time.<ref name=\"NFL Top 10\">{{cite AV media|title=[[NFL Top 10]] \u2013 Controversial Calls|publisher=[[NFL Films]]}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Ford Field Super Bowl XL night.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Looking toward the stadium]]\n\n[[Ford Field]] was selected to host Super Bowl XL on November 1, 2000, at the owners meetings held in Atlanta, two years before the stadium opened in 2002;<ref>Unknown.

In a related note, [[Roger Penske]], owner of a [[Penske Automotive Group|car dealership]], [[Penske Racing|racing team]], and other related companies, headed the Super Bowl XL host committee.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be played on the newer [[FieldTurf]] surface; each of the previous Super Bowls had been played either on natural grass or on the first-generation [[AstroTurf]].\n\nThe Seahawks became the first team to have their full team name painted in their end zone for a [[Super Bowl]], as their geographic location name (Seattle) was painted above the team nickname (Seahawks). In [[Super Bowl XLIII]], the [[Arizona Cardinals]] became the second team to have their full team name painted in their end zone, as their geographic location name (Arizona) was painted above the team nickname (Cardinals). For all other [[Super Bowl]] teams, end zones have featured only the team nickname.\n\n===Teams===\n\n====Seattle Seahawks====\n{{Main article|2005 Seattle Seahawks season}}\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a summary, please do not add too much detail. The main Seahawks article is probably best for detailed additions -->\nThe Seahawks entered Super Bowl XL after finishing the regular season with an NFC-best 13\u20133 record. After a rocky 2\u20132 start, they won 11 consecutive games before losing to the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] to finish the season. The 13\u20133 record and 11-game winning streak set new team records.\n\nThis was Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance in the team's 30-year history. The Seahawks had been mediocre for much of the 1990s, recording eight consecutive non-winning seasons from [[1991 Seattle Seahawks season|1991]] through [[1998 Seattle Seahawks season|1998]]. The team hit a low point in [[1996 Seattle Seahawks season|1996]], when then-owner [[Ken Behring]] announced his intention to move the team to the Los Angeles area. The team's fortunes began to turn in [[1997 Seattle Seahawks season|1997]], when [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] bought the team and brokered a deal to build a new football stadium, [[Qwest Field]] (now CenturyLink Field), to replace the aging [[Kingdome]]. [[Mike Holmgren]], who had led the [[Green Bay Packers]] to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXII|XXXII]], became head coach in 1999. He became the fifth coach to take two franchises to the Super Bowl.<ref>[[Don Shula]] ([[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]/[[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]), [[Bill Parcells]] ([[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]/[[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), [[Dan Reeves]] ([[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]/[[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]) & [[Dick Vermeil]] ([[1980 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]/[[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]])</ref>  [[Joe Jurevicius]] became the sixth player to play in a Super Bowl with three teams.\n\nBehind running back [[Shaun Alexander]], Seattle finished the 2005 season as the league's top offense, scoring 452 points. Meanwhile, quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] completed 65.5 percent of his passes for 3,455 yards and 24 touchdowns (against just nine interceptions) and added 124 yards and one touchdown on the ground. Alexander, who had scored at least 16 touchdowns in each of the previous four seasons, had the best campaign of his career, leading the league with 1,880 rushing yards and scoring an NFL-record 28 touchdowns, for which he was rewarded with the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]]. Although the Seahawks suffered injuries to starting wide receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Bobby Engram]] throughout the season, the passing game proved potent, as Engram managed 67 receptions for 778 yards. [[Joe Jurevicius]], a backup when the season began, started eleven games and caught 55 passes for 694 yards and 10 touchdowns; tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]] also emerged as a Hasselbeck target, catching 45 passes for 554 yards and scoring five touchdowns. Hasselbeck was protected and Alexander was given time to run by a stout offensive line, led by Pro Bowl offensive tackle [[Walter Jones (American football)|Walter Jones]], guard [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]], and center [[Robbie Tobeck]], and by bruising Pro Bowl fullback [[Mack Strong]].\n\nThough unheralded rookie middle linebacker [[Lofa Tatupu]] was the Seahawks' only defensive Pro Bowl selection, the Seahawks' defense recorded 50 quarterback sacks, leading the NFL in that category; [[defensive end]] [[Bryce Fisher]] led the Seahawks with nine sacks, while [[defensive tackle]] [[Rocky Bernard]] added 8.5 and veteran defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]] recorded four. Despite starting two rookies at linebacker for most of the year, the Seattle linebacking corps played well, led by Tatupu, who topped the team with 104 tackles and added four sacks, three interceptions, and one fumble recovery. From his strong safety position, [[Michael Boulware]] led the team with four interceptions and also tallied two sacks and one fumble recovery. The Seattle secondary suffered injuries throughout the year, notably to free safety [[Ken Hamlin]]; second-year [[cornerback]] [[Jordan Babineaux]] played well as he appeared in all sixteen games for Seattle, intercepting three passes and making 61 tackles. For the year, the defense surrendered just 271 points, 181 fewer than the Seahawks offense scored.\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{Main article|2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season}}\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is merely a summary, please do not add too much detail. The main Steelers article is probably best for detailed additions. -->\n\nAfter stumbling to a 7\u20135 start, the Steelers rebounded and entered Super Bowl XL finishing the regular season with an 11\u20135 record. (Although the team finished tied with the [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] for the division lead, the Bengals won the tiebreaker for the [[AFC North]] championship based on better divisional record.) They also became the first team ever to defeat the top three [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded teams]] on the road in the playoffs (#3 Cincinnati, #1 Indianapolis and #2 Denver). In addition, the team became the first sixth-seeded team to reach both a conference championship game and the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team playoff format in [[1990 NFL season|1990]].\n\nUnder [[Bill Cowher]]'s reign as head coach since [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1992]], the Steelers had been one of the top teams in the NFL, making the playoffs in 10 out of his 14 seasons, advancing to the [[AFC Championship Game]] six times, and making an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXX]], losing to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27\u201317. After having finished the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] with a 6\u201310 record and after splitting its first two games to open [[2004 NFL season|2004]], Pittsburgh lost starting [[quarterback]] [[Tommy Maddox]] to injury. Maddox was replaced by rookie quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]], who was drafted with the 11th pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] but was not expected to play during his rookie season. Nevertheless, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to victory in all of the team's 14 remaining regular season games, giving Pittsburgh a 15\u20131 record and making the Steelers the first AFC team ever to win 15 games. However, the Steelers lost to eventual Super Bowl champion [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nPittsburgh began the 2005 season by winning seven of its first nine games, but suffered a major setback when both Roethlisberger and his backup, [[Charlie Batch]], went down with injuries. With Maddox back as the starter, the team was upset by [[2005 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore]] and dropped two more games after Roethlisberger's return, falling to then-undefeated Indianapolis, and division rival [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]]. The postseason hopes of the Steelers were in peril, but the team recovered to win its final four regular season games and to claim the sixth\u2014and final\u2014seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nRoethlisberger was efficient in his 12 regular season games, throwing for 2,385 yards and seventeen touchdowns with nine interceptions, while adding three rushing touchdowns. The Steelers' main receiving threat was [[wide receiver]] Hines Ward, who led the team with 69 receptions for 975 yards and eleven touchdowns. His 69 catches gave him a career total of 574, surpassing a franchise record for receptions previously held by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[John Stallworth]]. On the other side of the field, speedy wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]] was a constant breakaway threat, catching 35 passes for 558 yards, while gaining 448 yards and two touchdowns on punt returns. Rookie [[tight end]] [[Heath Miller]] also recorded 39 receptions for 459 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh's main strength on offense, however, was its running game. [[Running back]] [[Willie Parker]] was the team's leading rusher with 1,202 yards, while also recording 18 catches for 218 yards and scoring five touchdowns. In short-yardage situations, the team relied on 255-pound running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who rushed for 368 yards and scored nine touchdowns. The 33-year-old Bettis finished his 13th NFL season as the league's fifth all-time leading rusher (13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns), but until this point he had never played in a Super Bowl. The Steelers rushing attack was powered by an offensive line led by [[Pro Bowl]] [[Guard (American football)|guard]] [[Alan Faneca]] and Pro Bowl reserve [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jeff Hartings]].\n\nThe Steelers defense ranked fourth in the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its [[linebacker|linebacking]] corps: [[Joey Porter]], [[James Farrior]], [[Clark Haggans]], and [[Larry Foote]]. Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5 [[quarterback sack]]s and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery. In the secondary, [[Defensive back|free safety]] [[Chris Hope]] led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety [[Troy Polamalu]], the team's top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, three sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.\n\nThe Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs. The [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]] (against the [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]), and the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]] (against the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]), also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.\n\nOf a \"bridging the eras\" moment, Steelers [[cornerback]] [[Willie J. Williams (cornerback)|Willie Williams]] was the last remaining player to have been on the Steelers last Super Bowl team, their [[Super Bowl XXX]] loss to the Dallas Cowboys following the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]]. (Defensive backs coach [[Darren Perry]] was also a player on the Super Bowl XXX team. Both were starters in that game.) Ironically, Williams, who was in his second stint with the Steelers at the time, played with Seattle from 1997\u20132003. He was inactive for Super Bowl XL, which, like Bettis, turned out to be his final NFL game before retiring that offseason.\n\n===Statistical comparison===\nThe chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Statistic'''\n!'''Seattle Seahawks'''\n!'''Pittsburgh Steelers'''\n|-\n|Points scored per game||28.2 (1st)||24.3 (9th)\n|-\n|Points allowed per game||16.9 (7th)||16.1 (3rd, tied)\n|-\n|Rushing yards gained per game||153.6 (3rd)||138.9 (5th)\n|-\n|Rushing yards allowed per game||94.4 (5th)||86.0 (3rd)\n|-\n|Passing yards gained per game||216.1 (13th)||182.9 (24th)\n|-\n|Passing yards allowed per game||222.4 (25th)||198.0 (16th)\n|-\n|Yards gained per play||5.8 (2nd)||5.4 (10th)\n|-\n|Yards allowed per play||4.9 (10th)||4.6 (3rd)\n|-\n|Time of possession per game||29:17 (21st)||31:16 (8th)\n|-\n|Third-down conversion percentage||39.6 (13th, tied)||35.4 (23rd)\n|-\n|Third-down conversion percentage allowed||38.0 (16th)||39.7 (20th)\n|-\n|Fourth-down conversion percentage||87.5 (1st)||41.7 (20th)\n|-\n|Fourth-down conversion percentage allowed||63.2 (26th)||35.3 (8th)\n|-\n|Red zone touchdown conversion percentage||71.7 (1st)||60.7 (4th, tied)\n|-\n|Red zone touchdown conversion percentage allowed||47.9 (10th, tied)||40.4 (2nd)\n|-\n|Total turnover differential||+10 (7th)||+7 (9th, tied)\n|}\n\n===Playoffs===\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a very short summary, please only add detailed additions to the main playoff article -->{{Further information|2005\u201306 NFL playoffs}}\n\nThe Seahawks became the first team to advance to the Super Bowl without playing a [[Division (sport)|division]] champion in the playoffs (later matched by the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts in 2009]], [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers in 2010]], and [[2013 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seahawks again in 2013]], with the 2013 Seahawks being the only one of the four to win the Super Bowl). Off a first-round [[Bye (sports)|bye]], Seattle defeated the sixth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]], 20\u201310, before eliminating the fifth-seeded [[Carolina Panthers]], 34\u201314, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. These were Seattle's first playoff victories since the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] when they defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 13\u20137, when the team was still in the AFC (the Seahawks were in that conference from 1977-2001).\n\nThe Steelers became the second team after the [[1985 NFL season|1985]] [[New England Patriots]] to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh defeated the third-seeded [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]], 31\u201317; the top-seeded [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]], 21\u201318 in the ''[[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle|Immaculate Redemption/Tackle II]]'' game; and the second-seeded [[Denver Broncos]], 34\u201317, in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. The Steelers also became the eighth [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team to go to the Super Bowl and the fourth in nine seasons. The Steelers' catchphrase for the playoffs was \"One for the Thumb\", a phrase originally made popular by [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] as an allusion to a fifth Super Bowl ring.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wexell|first1=Jim|title=Pittsburgh Steelers: Men of Steel|date=2006|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1582619964|page=79|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFmSC3oKhgUC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=one+for+the+thumb+joe+greene&source=bl&ots=_Y2AUIRX8N&sig=Ot2bZhO3m9KTpMxcRfibXD4sqCQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW_OSF6pnQAhWE2SYKHZCvCVI4ChDoAQg5MAE#v=onepage&q=one%20for%20the%20thumb%20joe%20greene&f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Practice venues===\n\n====Seahawks====\nThe Seahawks practiced at the [[Detroit Lions]]' practice facility in [[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]].<ref name=turf/>\n\n====Steelers====\nThe Steelers practiced at the [[Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] (site of [[Super Bowl XVI]]).

Quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] then started off the drive with a pair of completions to receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Joe Jurevicius]] for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively. On the third play of the drive, Jackson caught a pass in the end-zone, apparently for a touchdown, but the play was nullified as Jackson was called for pass interference. Running back [[Shaun Alexander]] ran the ball the next two plays, but gained only three yards. Hasselbeck's third-down pass attempt fell incomplete, and the Seahawks were forced to settle for a 47-yard field goal by kicker [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]], which was successful.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SuperBowlXLactionshot.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A pass in the air shortly after [[Matt Hasselbeck]] released the ball.]] -->\nBy the end of the first quarter, the Steelers had failed to gain a first down, and quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] had completed one of five pass attempts for one yard.\n\n===Second Quarter===\nOn their first second-quarter possession, Pittsburgh once more was forced to punt after three plays, but benefited from another Seahawks penalty, a holding call that nullified Warrick's 34-yard punt return. The Steelers forced a Seattle punt, but Seattle safety [[Michael Boulware]] intercepted a Roethlisberger pass at the Seattle 17-yard line on the ensuing drive. The Seahawks, though, were once more forced to punt after three plays, and Pittsburgh drove into Seattle territory on the following drive.\n\nAn offensive pass interference call against tight end [[Heath Miller]] and a sack for an eight-yard loss by Seahawks defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]], though, backed the Steelers to the 40-yard line, and left the team facing a third-down-and-28. However, Roethlisberger hit receiver [[Hines Ward]] out of a scramble and extremely unorthodox, against the grain pass for a 37-yard gain to give the team the longest third down conversion in Super Bowl history. [[Jerome Bettis]] carried the ball on the next two plays, taking his team to the one-yard line but not into the end-zone. On the third-down play, after the [[two-minute warning]], Roethlisberger faked a hand-off and dove into the end-zone himself. There was some confusion as to whether or not he had scored, since the referee hesitated for a bit after the play ended, but he eventually signaled a touchdown, and it was upheld after a replay challenge.\n\nOn the strength of a 19-yard Jurevicius reception, Seattle advanced the ball to the Pittsburgh 36-yard line, but, after the drive stalled, Brown missed a 54-yard field goal attempt to the right and the Steelers ran out the clock to end the first half.\n\n===Third Quarter===\nThe Steelers took the ball to begin the second half, and just two plays in, running back [[Willie Parker]] broke through for a 75-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 14\u20133 lead and setting a record for the longest run in Super Bowl history, beating [[Marcus Allen]]'s [[Super Bowl XVIII]] mark by one yard.\n\nThe Seahawks drove into Pittsburgh territory on the next drive, sparked by a 21-yard run by Alexander, but Brown again missed a field-goal attempt, this one from 50 yards, as Seattle was unable to close the 11-point deficit.\n\nPittsburgh drove 54 yards to the Seattle six-yard line to put themselves in position to take a large lead, but Seahawks defensive back [[Kelly Herndon]] intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger and returned it a Super Bowl record 76 yards to the Steelers 20-yard line. From there, the Seahawks required just two plays to score on Hasselbeck's 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]], cutting their deficit to 14\u201310.\n\nThe teams exchanged punts (two from Pittsburgh, one from Seattle) to fill out most of the third quarter, but the Seahawks ended the quarter having driven from their own two-yard line to near midfield.\n\n===Fourth Quarter===\nThe drive continued in the fourth quarter, as the Seahawks reached the Pittsburgh 19-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Stevens, though, was negated on a penalty call against Seattle tackle [[Sean Locklear]] for holding, denying the Seahawks an opportunity for a first-down-and-goal from the 1-yard-line. Three plays later, Pittsburgh defensive back [[Ike Taylor]] intercepted a Hasselbeck pass at the 5-yard line and returned it 24 yards. While tackling Taylor, Hasselbeck dove low and was flagged for blocking below the waist. The penalty added 15 yards to the return and gave the Steelers the ball on their own 44-yard line.\n\nFour plays later, Pittsburgh ran a wide receiver reverse, but the play turned out to be a pass play by wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]], who played quarterback while in college. Parker took a pitch from Roethlisberger and handed off to Randle El, who was running in the opposite direction. Randle El then pulled up and threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Ward, giving the Steelers a 21\u201310 lead and also marking the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl.\n\nOn the ensuing possession, Hasselbeck ran the ball for eighteen yards and was briefly touched by Steelers linebacker [[Larry Foote]] as the former fell to the ground. Though the play was initially ruled a fumble, with the ball recovered by the Steelers, a Seahawks challenge proved successful, as officials ruled Hasselbeck to have been down prior to his having lost the ball, Seattle, aided by a 13-yard Jurevicius reception, drove to the Pittsburgh 48-yard line but could go no further; a [[Tom Rouen]] punt entered the end zone, giving the Steelers possession on their own 20-yard line.\n\nPittsburgh possessed the ball for nearly four-and-one-half minutes on the ensuing drive, as Bettis carried seven times, Seattle was forced to use all of its three timeouts to stop the clock, but nevertheless had only 1:51 left when it took the ball from its own 20-yard line following a Gardocki punt. A 35-yard reception by Jurevicius took the Seahawks into Pittsburgh territory, and a 13-yard [[Bobby Engram]] reception took the team to within field-goal range, but dubious clock-management and play-calling left the team with just 35 seconds remaining; an incompletion and a three-yard pass to Stevens over the middle of the field consumed 26 seconds, and Hasselbeck threw incomplete near Stevens on fourth down, giving the Steelers the ball on downs with just three seconds remaining, after which a Roethlisberger kneel-down ended the game.\n\n===Box score===\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=#eee\n|titlestyle=text-align:center;background-color:#000;color:#fff\n|title=Super Bowl XL: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Seattle Seahawks 10\n|Road=Seahawks (NFC)\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=7|R4=0\n|Home='''Steelers (AFC)'''\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=7\n|date=February 5, 2006\n|time=6:27 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|stadium=[[Ford Field]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]\n|attendance=68,206\n|weather={{convert|30|F|C}} (outdoors), {{convert|68|F|C}} (indoors), game played indoors, domed stadium<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n|TV=[[Monday Night Football|ABC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[John Madden]], [[Michele Tafoya]] and [[Suzy Kolber]]\n|reference={{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615112336/http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20060205_SEA@PIT |date=June 15, 2006 |title=Recap }}\n|state=uncollapsed\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart |VisitorName=SEA |HomeName=PIT |state=expanded}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=1 |Time=0:22 |Team=SEA |DrivePlays=7 |DriveLength=22 |DriveTime=3:39 |Type=FG |yards=47 |Kicker=[[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]] |Visitor=3 |Home=0}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:55 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=11 |DriveLength=59 |DriveTime=6:20 |Type=RushTD |Runner=[[Ben Roethlisberger]] |yards=1 |kickresult=good |Kicker=[[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] |Visitor=3 |Home=7}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=3 |Time=14:38 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=2 |DriveLength=75 |DriveTime=0:22 |Type=RushTD |Runner=[[Willie Parker]] |yards=75 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Reed |Visitor=3 |Home=14}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=3 |Time=6:45 |Team=SEA |DrivePlays=3 |DriveLength=20 |DriveTime=0:53 |Type=RecTD |Receiver=[[Jerramy Stevens]] |QB=[[Matt Hasselbeck]] |yards=16 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Brown |Visitor=10 |Home=14}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=4 |Time=8:56 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=4 |DriveLength=56 |DriveTime=1:50 |Type=RecTD |Receiver=[[Hines Ward]] |QB=[[Antwaan Randle El]] |yards=43 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Reed |Visitor=10 |Home=21}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEnd |Visitor=10 |Home=21}}\n\n===Statistical overview===\nThe Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a home game in the playoffs. The [[Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]], and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]], also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.\n\nRoethlisberger finished the game having completed just 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and having also thrown two interceptions; his 22.6 [[quarterback rating]]<ref name=\"Worse Super Bowl than Peyton Manning in XLVIII\">{{cite web|title=Canzano blog: Who had a worse Super Bowl than Peyton Manning?|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/john_canzano/index.ssf/2014/02/canzano_blog_so_you_think_peyt.html}}</ref> was the lowest ever by a Super Bowl winning quarterback. He also rushed for 25 yards and a touchdown. He became the second youngest [[quarterback]] to start in a Super Bowl and the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at 23 years, 11 months.\n\nThe Steelers rushing game was paced by Willie Parker, who gained 93 yards and one touchdown on ten carries, Bettis rushed 14 times for 43 yards, converted a key first down, and allowed his team to run time off the clock late in the fourth quarter. Ward caught five passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 43-yard touchdown pass, Randle El caught three passes for 22 yards and returned two punts for 32 yards. In defeat for the Seahawks, Hasselbeck completed 26 of 49 pass attempts for 273 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Jurevicius caught 5 passes for 93 yards. Engram and Jackson also played roles, combining to gain 120 yards on eleven receptions. Alexander led all rushers in the game, accumulating 95 yards on 20 carries while also catching two passes for two yards. The Steelers were the third team to lose the turnover battle and win the game, after the [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl V]] and the Steelers in [[Super Bowl XIV]].\n\nDefensively, Taylor led the Steelers, making seven tackles, defensing two passes, and intercepting Hasselbeck; for the Seahawks, linebacker Lofa Tatupu recorded nine tackles.\n\n==Final statistics==\nSources: [http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxl NFL.com Super Bowl XL], [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&super_bowl=1&match=summary_all&year_min=1966&year_max=2016&team_id=pit&opp_id=sea&quarter=1&quarter=2&quarter=3&quarter=4&quarter=5&tr_gtlt=lt&minutes=15&seconds=00&down=0&down=1&down=2&down=3&down=4&yg_gtlt=gt&is_first_down=-1&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type=PASS&type=RUSH&type=PUNT&type=KOFF&type=ONSD&type=FG&type=XP&type=2PCR&type=2PCP&is_complete=-1&is_turnover=-1&turnover_type=interception&turnover_type=fumble&is_scoring=-1&score_type=touchdown&score_type=field_goal&score_type=safety&is_sack=-1&include_kneels=-1&no_play=0&order_by=yards Super Bowl XL Play Finder Pit], [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&super_bowl=1&match=summary_all&year_min=1966&year_max=2016&team_id=sea&opp_id=pit&quarter=1&quarter=2&quarter=3&quarter=4&quarter=5&tr_gtlt=lt&minutes=15&seconds=00&down=0&down=1&down=2&down=3&down=4&yg_gtlt=gt&is_first_down=-1&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type=PASS&type=RUSH&type=PUNT&type=KOFF&type=ONSD&type=FG&type=XP&type=2PCR&type=2PCP&is_complete=-1&is_turnover=-1&turnover_type=interception&turnover_type=fumble&is_scoring=-1&score_type=touchdown&score_type=field_goal&score_type=safety&is_sack=-1&include_kneels=-1&no_play=0&order_by=yards Super Bowl XL Play Finder Sea]\n\n===Statistical comparison===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Seattle Seahawks\n!Pittsburgh Steelers\n|-\n|First downs||20||14\n|-\n|First downs rushing||5||6\n|-\n|First downs passing||15||8\n|-\n|First downs penalty||0||0\n|-\n|Third down efficiency||5/17||8/15\n|-\n|Fourth down efficiency||1/2||0/0\n|-\n|Net yards rushing||137||181\n|-\n|Rushing attempts||25||33\n|-\n|Yards per rush||5.5||5.5\n|-\n|Passing \u2013 Completions-attempts||26/49||10/22\n|-\n|Times sacked-total yards||3\u201314||1\u20138\n|-\n|Interceptions thrown||1||2\n|-\n|Net yards passing||259||158\n|-\n|Total net yards||396||339\n|-\n|Punt returns-total yards||4\u201327||2\u201332\n|-\n|Kickoff returns-total yards||4\u201371||2\u201343\n|-\n|Interceptions-total return yards||2\u201376||1\u201324\n|-\n|Punts-average yardage||6\u201350.2||6\u201348.7\n|-\n|Fumbles-lost||0\u20130||0\u20130\n|-\n|Penalties-yards||7\u201370||3\u201320\n|-\n|Time of possession||33:02||26:58\n|-\n|Turnovers||1||2\n|}\n\n===Individual leaders===\n{{col-float|width=48%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Passing\n|-\n!\n!C/ATT<sup>1</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!INT\n!Rating\n|-\n|[[Matt Hasselbeck]]\n|26/49\n|273\n|1\n|1\n|67.8\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Rushing\n|-\n!\n!Car<sup>2</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!LG<sup>3</sup>\n!Yds/Car\n|-\n|[[Shaun Alexander]]\n|20\n|95\n|0\n|21\n|4.75\n|-\n|Matt Hasselbeck\n|3\n|35\n|0\n|18\n|11.67\n|-\n|[[Mack Strong]]\n|2\n|7\n|0\n|7\n|3.50\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Receiving\n|-\n!\n!Rec<sup>4</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!LG<sup>3</sup>\n!Target<sup>5</sup>\n|-\n|[[Bobby Engram]]\n|6\n|70\n|0\n|21\n|9\n|-\n|[[Joe Jurevicius]]\n|5\n|93\n|0\n|35\n|8\n|-\n|[[Darrell Jackson]]\n|5\n|50\n|0\n|20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Jerramy Stevens]]\n|3\n|25\n|1\n|16t\n|8\n|-\n|Mack Strong\n|2\n|15\n|0\n|13\n|3\n|-\n|[[Ryan Hannam]]\n|2\n|12\n|0\n|9\n|2\n|-\n|Shaun Alexander\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|-\n|[[Maurice Morris]]\n|1\n|6\n|0\n|6\n|1\n|-\n|[[D.

One call that was complained about was an offensive pass interference on Seahawks wide receiver [[Darrell Jackson]] for a push-off against Steelers safety [[Chris Hope]] that nullified his 16-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/oconnor/2006-02-06-oconnor-xl_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Super Bowl referees foul, but then so was everything else | date=February 6, 2006 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> However, according to the NFL's Director of Officiating at the time, [[Mike Pereira]], the call was indeed correct as Jackson had pushed off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sea.scout.com/story/500006-plausible-deniability-part-one|title=Plausible Deniability, Part One|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAnother complaint had to do with a penalty in the fourth quarter against Seattle right tackle [[Sean Locklear]] for holding Steelers linebacker [[Clark Haggans]] that nullified a deep pass.

[[American football]] game between the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) champion [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to decide the [[National Football League]] (NFL) champion for the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]]. The Steelers defeated the Seahawks by the score of 21\u201310. The game was played on February 5, 2006, at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It is currently the last Super Bowl broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the first where all aspects of the game itself were aired in HD.<ref name=broadcastingcable/>\n\nWith the win, the Steelers tied the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] with the then-record five [[Super Bowl]]s. The Steelers' victory was their first Super Bowl victory since [[Super Bowl XIV]].  Pittsburgh, who finished the regular season with an 11\u20135 record, also became the fourth [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team, the third in nine years, and the first ever number 6 seed in the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]], to win a Super Bowl. The Seahawks, on the other hand, in their 30th season, were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an NFC-best 13\u20133 regular season record.\n\nPittsburgh capitalized on two big plays that were converted into touchdowns. The Steelers jumped to a 14\u20133 lead early in the third quarter with running back [[Willie Parker]]'s Super Bowl record 75-yard touchdown run. Seahawks defensive back [[Kelly Herndon]]'s Super Bowl record 76-yard interception return set up a Seattle touchdown to cut the lead 14\u201310. But Pittsburgh responded with [[Antwaan Randle El]]'s 43-yard touchdown pass to [[Hines Ward]], the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, to clinch the game in the fourth quarter. Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named [[Super Bowl MVP]].\n\nThe [[#Reaction to officiating|officiating in Super Bowl XL]] was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game, leading [[NFL Films]] to rank it as one of the top ten controversial calls of all time.<ref name=\"NFL Top 10\">{{cite AV media|title=[[NFL Top 10]] \u2013 Controversial Calls|publisher=[[NFL Films]]}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Ford Field Super Bowl XL night.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Looking toward the stadium]]\n\n[[Ford Field]] was selected to host Super Bowl XL on November 1, 2000, at the owners meetings held in Atlanta, two years before the stadium opened in 2002;<ref>Unknown.

In a related note, [[Roger Penske]], owner of a [[Penske Automotive Group|car dealership]], [[Penske Racing|racing team]], and other related companies, headed the Super Bowl XL host committee.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be played on the newer [[FieldTurf]] surface; each of the previous Super Bowls had been played either on natural grass or on the first-generation [[AstroTurf]].\n\nThe Seahawks became the first team to have their full team name painted in their end zone for a [[Super Bowl]], as their geographic location name (Seattle) was painted above the team nickname (Seahawks). In [[Super Bowl XLIII]], the [[Arizona Cardinals]] became the second team to have their full team name painted in their end zone, as their geographic location name (Arizona) was painted above the team nickname (Cardinals).

The main Seahawks article is probably best for detailed additions -->\nThe Seahawks entered Super Bowl XL after finishing the regular season with an NFC-best 13\u20133 record. After a rocky 2\u20132 start, they won 11 consecutive games before losing to the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] to finish the season. The 13\u20133 record and 11-game winning streak set new team records.\n\nThis was Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance in the team's 30-year history. The Seahawks had been mediocre for much of the 1990s, recording eight consecutive non-winning seasons from [[1991 Seattle Seahawks season|1991]] through [[1998 Seattle Seahawks season|1998]]. The team hit a low point in [[1996 Seattle Seahawks season|1996]], when then-owner [[Ken Behring]] announced his intention to move the team to the Los Angeles area. The team's fortunes began to turn in [[1997 Seattle Seahawks season|1997]], when [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] bought the team and brokered a deal to build a new football stadium, [[Qwest Field]] (now CenturyLink Field), to replace the aging [[Kingdome]]. [[Mike Holmgren]], who had led the [[Green Bay Packers]] to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXII|XXXII]], became head coach in 1999. He became the fifth coach to take two franchises to the Super Bowl.<ref>[[Don Shula]] ([[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]/[[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]), [[Bill Parcells]] ([[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]/[[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), [[Dan Reeves]] ([[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]/[[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]) & [[Dick Vermeil]] ([[1980 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]/[[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]])</ref>  [[Joe Jurevicius]] became the sixth player to play in a Super Bowl with three teams.\n\nBehind running back [[Shaun Alexander]], Seattle finished the 2005 season as the league's top offense, scoring 452 points. Meanwhile, quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] completed 65.5 percent of his passes for 3,455 yards and 24 touchdowns (against just nine interceptions) and added 124 yards and one touchdown on the ground. Alexander, who had scored at least 16 touchdowns in each of the previous four seasons, had the best campaign of his career, leading the league with 1,880 rushing yards and scoring an NFL-record 28 touchdowns, for which he was rewarded with the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]]. Although the Seahawks suffered injuries to starting wide receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Bobby Engram]] throughout the season, the passing game proved potent, as Engram managed 67 receptions for 778 yards. [[Joe Jurevicius]], a backup when the season began, started eleven games and caught 55 passes for 694 yards and 10 touchdowns; tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]] also emerged as a Hasselbeck target, catching 45 passes for 554 yards and scoring five touchdowns. Hasselbeck was protected and Alexander was given time to run by a stout offensive line, led by Pro Bowl offensive tackle [[Walter Jones (American football)|Walter Jones]], guard [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]], and center [[Robbie Tobeck]], and by bruising Pro Bowl fullback [[Mack Strong]].\n\nThough unheralded rookie middle linebacker [[Lofa Tatupu]] was the Seahawks' only defensive Pro Bowl selection, the Seahawks' defense recorded 50 quarterback sacks, leading the NFL in that category; [[defensive end]] [[Bryce Fisher]] led the Seahawks with nine sacks, while [[defensive tackle]] [[Rocky Bernard]] added 8.5 and veteran defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]] recorded four. Despite starting two rookies at linebacker for most of the year, the Seattle linebacking corps played well, led by Tatupu, who topped the team with 104 tackles and added four sacks, three interceptions, and one fumble recovery. From his strong safety position, [[Michael Boulware]] led the team with four interceptions and also tallied two sacks and one fumble recovery. The Seattle secondary suffered injuries throughout the year, notably to free safety [[Ken Hamlin]]; second-year [[cornerback]] [[Jordan Babineaux]] played well as he appeared in all sixteen games for Seattle, intercepting three passes and making 61 tackles. For the year, the defense surrendered just 271 points, 181 fewer than the Seahawks offense scored.\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{Main article|2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season}}\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is merely a summary, please do not add too much detail. The main Steelers article is probably best for detailed additions. -->\n\nAfter stumbling to a 7\u20135 start, the Steelers rebounded and entered Super Bowl XL finishing the regular season with an 11\u20135 record. (Although the team finished tied with the [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] for the division lead, the Bengals won the tiebreaker for the [[AFC North]] championship based on better divisional record.) They also became the first team ever to defeat the top three [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded teams]] on the road in the playoffs (#3 Cincinnati, #1 Indianapolis and #2 Denver). In addition, the team became the first sixth-seeded team to reach both a conference championship game and the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team playoff format in [[1990 NFL season|1990]].\n\nUnder [[Bill Cowher]]'s reign as head coach since [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1992]], the Steelers had been one of the top teams in the NFL, making the playoffs in 10 out of his 14 seasons, advancing to the [[AFC Championship Game]] six times, and making an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXX]], losing to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27\u201317. After having finished the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] with a 6\u201310 record and after splitting its first two games to open [[2004 NFL season|2004]], Pittsburgh lost starting [[quarterback]] [[Tommy Maddox]] to injury. Maddox was replaced by rookie quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]], who was drafted with the 11th pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] but was not expected to play during his rookie season. Nevertheless, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to victory in all of the team's 14 remaining regular season games, giving Pittsburgh a 15\u20131 record and making the Steelers the first AFC team ever to win 15 games. However, the Steelers lost to eventual Super Bowl champion [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nPittsburgh began the 2005 season by winning seven of its first nine games, but suffered a major setback when both Roethlisberger and his backup, [[Charlie Batch]], went down with injuries. With Maddox back as the starter, the team was upset by [[2005 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore]] and dropped two more games after Roethlisberger's return, falling to then-undefeated Indianapolis, and division rival [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]]. The postseason hopes of the Steelers were in peril, but the team recovered to win its final four regular season games and to claim the sixth\u2014and final\u2014seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nRoethlisberger was efficient in his 12 regular season games, throwing for 2,385 yards and seventeen touchdowns with nine interceptions, while adding three rushing touchdowns. The Steelers' main receiving threat was [[wide receiver]] Hines Ward, who led the team with 69 receptions for 975 yards and eleven touchdowns. His 69 catches gave him a career total of 574, surpassing a franchise record for receptions previously held by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[John Stallworth]]. On the other side of the field, speedy wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]] was a constant breakaway threat, catching 35 passes for 558 yards, while gaining 448 yards and two touchdowns on punt returns. Rookie [[tight end]] [[Heath Miller]] also recorded 39 receptions for 459 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nPittsburgh's main strength on offense, however, was its running game. [[Running back]] [[Willie Parker]] was the team's leading rusher with 1,202 yards, while also recording 18 catches for 218 yards and scoring five touchdowns. In short-yardage situations, the team relied on 255-pound running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who rushed for 368 yards and scored nine touchdowns. The 33-year-old Bettis finished his 13th NFL season as the league's fifth all-time leading rusher (13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns), but until this point he had never played in a Super Bowl. The Steelers rushing attack was powered by an offensive line led by [[Pro Bowl]] [[Guard (American football)|guard]] [[Alan Faneca]] and Pro Bowl reserve [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jeff Hartings]].\n\nThe Steelers defense ranked fourth in the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its [[linebacker|linebacking]] corps: [[Joey Porter]], [[James Farrior]], [[Clark Haggans]], and [[Larry Foote]]. Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5 [[quarterback sack]]s and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery. In the secondary, [[Defensive back|free safety]] [[Chris Hope]] led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety [[Troy Polamalu]], the team's top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, three sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.\n\nThe Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs. The [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]] (against the [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]), and the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]] (against the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]), also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.\n\nOf a \"bridging the eras\" moment, Steelers [[cornerback]] [[Willie J. Williams (cornerback)|Willie Williams]] was the last remaining player to have been on the Steelers last Super Bowl team, their [[Super Bowl XXX]] loss to the Dallas Cowboys following the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]]. (Defensive backs coach [[Darren Perry]] was also a player on the Super Bowl XXX team. Both were starters in that game.) Ironically, Williams, who was in his second stint with the Steelers at the time, played with Seattle from 1997\u20132003. He was inactive for Super Bowl XL, which, like Bettis, turned out to be his final NFL game before retiring that offseason.\n\n===Statistical comparison===\nThe chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Statistic'''\n!'''Seattle Seahawks'''\n!'''Pittsburgh Steelers'''\n|-\n|Points scored per game||28.2 (1st)||24.3 (9th)\n|-\n|Points allowed per game||16.9 (7th)||16.1 (3rd, tied)\n|-\n|Rushing yards gained per game||153.6 (3rd)||138.9 (5th)\n|-\n|Rushing yards allowed per game||94.4 (5th)||86.0 (3rd)\n|-\n|Passing yards gained per game||216.1 (13th)||182.9 (24th)\n|-\n|Passing yards allowed per game||222.4 (25th)||198.0 (16th)\n|-\n|Yards gained per play||5.8 (2nd)||5.4 (10th)\n|-\n|Yards allowed per play||4.9 (10th)||4.6 (3rd)\n|-\n|Time of possession per game||29:17 (21st)||31:16 (8th)\n|-\n|Third-down conversion percentage||39.6 (13th, tied)||35.4 (23rd)\n|-\n|Third-down conversion percentage allowed||38.0 (16th)||39.7 (20th)\n|-\n|Fourth-down conversion percentage||87.5 (1st)||41.7 (20th)\n|-\n|Fourth-down conversion percentage allowed||63.2 (26th)||35.3 (8th)\n|-\n|Red zone touchdown conversion percentage||71.7 (1st)||60.7 (4th, tied)\n|-\n|Red zone touchdown conversion percentage allowed||47.9 (10th, tied)||40.4 (2nd)\n|-\n|Total turnover differential||+10 (7th)||+7 (9th, tied)\n|}\n\n===Playoffs===\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a very short summary, please only add detailed additions to the main playoff article -->{{Further information|2005\u201306 NFL playoffs}}\n\nThe Seahawks became the first team to advance to the Super Bowl without playing a [[Division (sport)|division]] champion in the playoffs (later matched by the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts in 2009]], [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers in 2010]], and [[2013 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seahawks again in 2013]], with the 2013 Seahawks being the only one of the four to win the Super Bowl). Off a first-round [[Bye (sports)|bye]], Seattle defeated the sixth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]], 20\u201310, before eliminating the fifth-seeded [[Carolina Panthers]], 34\u201314, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. These were Seattle's first playoff victories since the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] when they defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 13\u20137, when the team was still in the AFC (the Seahawks were in that conference from 1977-2001).\n\nThe Steelers became the second team after the [[1985 NFL season|1985]] [[New England Patriots]] to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh defeated the third-seeded [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]], 31\u201317; the top-seeded [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]], 21\u201318 in the ''[[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle|Immaculate Redemption/Tackle II]]'' game; and the second-seeded [[Denver Broncos]], 34\u201317, in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. The Steelers also became the eighth [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team to go to the Super Bowl and the fourth in nine seasons. The Steelers' catchphrase for the playoffs was \"One for the Thumb\", a phrase originally made popular by [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] as an allusion to a fifth Super Bowl ring.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wexell|first1=Jim|title=Pittsburgh Steelers: Men of Steel|date=2006|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1582619964|page=79|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFmSC3oKhgUC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=one+for+the+thumb+joe+greene&source=bl&ots=_Y2AUIRX8N&sig=Ot2bZhO3m9KTpMxcRfibXD4sqCQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW_OSF6pnQAhWE2SYKHZCvCVI4ChDoAQg5MAE#v=onepage&q=one%20for%20the%20thumb%20joe%20greene&f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Practice venues===\n\n====Seahawks====\nThe Seahawks practiced at the [[Detroit Lions]]' practice facility in [[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]].<ref name=turf/>\n\n====Steelers====\nThe Steelers practiced at the [[Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] (site of [[Super Bowl XVI]]).

The opening theme was sung by [[Hank Williams Jr]]., who was later spotted in the stands wearing Steelers regalia.\n\nThis game was the second Super Bowl broadcast for the Michaels-Madden pairing after they had called [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] for ABC three years earlier. Madden had already signed with NBC to broadcast games for them beginning in the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]; several days later Michaels, who was still under contract to ABC and ESPN, joined him in exchange for ESPN gaining partial coverage of the [[Ryder Cup]] golf tournament and [[The Walt Disney Company]], ABC's parent, gaining all intellectual property rights to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], a cartoon character that Walt Disney had created for [[Universal Pictures]] (NBC's corporate sibling) in the 1920s.<ref>Unknown.

(These teams have since been joined by the [[New York Giants]], who also surpassed them by winning a Super Bowl on each of the networks that carried the game; their win in [[Super Bowl XXI]] was carried by CBS, their win in [[Super Bowl XXV]] was carried by ABC, their win in [[Super Bowl XLII]] was carried by Fox, and their win in [[Super Bowl XLVI]] was carried by NBC.)\n\nBefore this game, the NFC was 6\u20130 in Super Bowls broadcast on ABC.\n\n[[File:RenCenSuperBowlXLESPNset.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Renaissance Center]] Wintergarden turned into an [[ESPN]] studio for Super Bowl XL.]]\n\n=====Studio show=====\n[[Chris Berman]], from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned corporate sibling ESPN, returned to host ABC's pregame show, as he had done for the network's coverage of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXIV|XXXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVII|XXXVII]].

Quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] then started off the drive with a pair of completions to receivers [[Darrell Jackson]] and [[Joe Jurevicius]] for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively. On the third play of the drive, Jackson caught a pass in the end-zone, apparently for a touchdown, but the play was nullified as Jackson was called for pass interference. Running back [[Shaun Alexander]] ran the ball the next two plays, but gained only three yards. Hasselbeck's third-down pass attempt fell incomplete, and the Seahawks were forced to settle for a 47-yard field goal by kicker [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]], which was successful.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SuperBowlXLactionshot.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A pass in the air shortly after [[Matt Hasselbeck]] released the ball.]] -->\nBy the end of the first quarter, the Steelers had failed to gain a first down, and quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] had completed one of five pass attempts for one yard.\n\n===Second Quarter===\nOn their first second-quarter possession, Pittsburgh once more was forced to punt after three plays, but benefited from another Seahawks penalty, a holding call that nullified Warrick's 34-yard punt return. The Steelers forced a Seattle punt, but Seattle safety [[Michael Boulware]] intercepted a Roethlisberger pass at the Seattle 17-yard line on the ensuing drive. The Seahawks, though, were once more forced to punt after three plays, and Pittsburgh drove into Seattle territory on the following drive.\n\nAn offensive pass interference call against tight end [[Heath Miller]] and a sack for an eight-yard loss by Seahawks defensive end [[Grant Wistrom]], though, backed the Steelers to the 40-yard line, and left the team facing a third-down-and-28. However, Roethlisberger hit receiver [[Hines Ward]] out of a scramble and extremely unorthodox, against the grain pass for a 37-yard gain to give the team the longest third down conversion in Super Bowl history. [[Jerome Bettis]] carried the ball on the next two plays, taking his team to the one-yard line but not into the end-zone. On the third-down play, after the [[two-minute warning]], Roethlisberger faked a hand-off and dove into the end-zone himself. There was some confusion as to whether or not he had scored, since the referee hesitated for a bit after the play ended, but he eventually signaled a touchdown, and it was upheld after a replay challenge.\n\nOn the strength of a 19-yard Jurevicius reception, Seattle advanced the ball to the Pittsburgh 36-yard line, but, after the drive stalled, Brown missed a 54-yard field goal attempt to the right and the Steelers ran out the clock to end the first half.\n\n===Third Quarter===\nThe Steelers took the ball to begin the second half, and just two plays in, running back [[Willie Parker]] broke through for a 75-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 14\u20133 lead and setting a record for the longest run in Super Bowl history, beating [[Marcus Allen]]'s [[Super Bowl XVIII]] mark by one yard.\n\nThe Seahawks drove into Pittsburgh territory on the next drive, sparked by a 21-yard run by Alexander, but Brown again missed a field-goal attempt, this one from 50 yards, as Seattle was unable to close the 11-point deficit.\n\nPittsburgh drove 54 yards to the Seattle six-yard line to put themselves in position to take a large lead, but Seahawks defensive back [[Kelly Herndon]] intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger and returned it a Super Bowl record 76 yards to the Steelers 20-yard line. From there, the Seahawks required just two plays to score on Hasselbeck's 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]], cutting their deficit to 14\u201310.\n\nThe teams exchanged punts (two from Pittsburgh, one from Seattle) to fill out most of the third quarter, but the Seahawks ended the quarter having driven from their own two-yard line to near midfield.\n\n===Fourth Quarter===\nThe drive continued in the fourth quarter, as the Seahawks reached the Pittsburgh 19-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Stevens, though, was negated on a penalty call against Seattle tackle [[Sean Locklear]] for holding, denying the Seahawks an opportunity for a first-down-and-goal from the 1-yard-line. Three plays later, Pittsburgh defensive back [[Ike Taylor]] intercepted a Hasselbeck pass at the 5-yard line and returned it 24 yards. While tackling Taylor, Hasselbeck dove low and was flagged for blocking below the waist. The penalty added 15 yards to the return and gave the Steelers the ball on their own 44-yard line.\n\nFour plays later, Pittsburgh ran a wide receiver reverse, but the play turned out to be a pass play by wide receiver [[Antwaan Randle El]], who played quarterback while in college. Parker took a pitch from Roethlisberger and handed off to Randle El, who was running in the opposite direction. Randle El then pulled up and threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Ward, giving the Steelers a 21\u201310 lead and also marking the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl.\n\nOn the ensuing possession, Hasselbeck ran the ball for eighteen yards and was briefly touched by Steelers linebacker [[Larry Foote]] as the former fell to the ground. Though the play was initially ruled a fumble, with the ball recovered by the Steelers, a Seahawks challenge proved successful, as officials ruled Hasselbeck to have been down prior to his having lost the ball, Seattle, aided by a 13-yard Jurevicius reception, drove to the Pittsburgh 48-yard line but could go no further; a [[Tom Rouen]] punt entered the end zone, giving the Steelers possession on their own 20-yard line.\n\nPittsburgh possessed the ball for nearly four-and-one-half minutes on the ensuing drive, as Bettis carried seven times, Seattle was forced to use all of its three timeouts to stop the clock, but nevertheless had only 1:51 left when it took the ball from its own 20-yard line following a Gardocki punt. A 35-yard reception by Jurevicius took the Seahawks into Pittsburgh territory, and a 13-yard [[Bobby Engram]] reception took the team to within field-goal range, but dubious clock-management and play-calling left the team with just 35 seconds remaining; an incompletion and a three-yard pass to Stevens over the middle of the field consumed 26 seconds, and Hasselbeck threw incomplete near Stevens on fourth down, giving the Steelers the ball on downs with just three seconds remaining, after which a Roethlisberger kneel-down ended the game.\n\n===Box score===\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|bg=#eee\n|titlestyle=text-align:center;background-color:#000;color:#fff\n|title=Super Bowl XL: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Seattle Seahawks 10\n|Road=Seahawks (NFC)\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=7|R4=0\n|Home='''Steelers (AFC)'''\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=7\n|date=February 5, 2006\n|time=6:27 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|stadium=[[Ford Field]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]\n|attendance=68,206\n|weather={{convert|30|F|C}} (outdoors), {{convert|68|F|C}} (indoors), game played indoors, domed stadium<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|referee=[[Bill Leavy]]\n|TV=[[Monday Night Football|ABC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[John Madden]], [[Michele Tafoya]] and [[Suzy Kolber]]\n|reference={{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615112336/http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20060205_SEA@PIT |date=June 15, 2006 |title=Recap }}\n|state=uncollapsed\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart |VisitorName=SEA |HomeName=PIT |state=expanded}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=1 |Time=0:22 |Team=SEA |DrivePlays=7 |DriveLength=22 |DriveTime=3:39 |Type=FG |yards=47 |Kicker=[[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]] |Visitor=3 |Home=0}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:55 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=11 |DriveLength=59 |DriveTime=6:20 |Type=RushTD |Runner=[[Ben Roethlisberger]] |yards=1 |kickresult=good |Kicker=[[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] |Visitor=3 |Home=7}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=3 |Time=14:38 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=2 |DriveLength=75 |DriveTime=0:22 |Type=RushTD |Runner=[[Willie Parker]] |yards=75 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Reed |Visitor=3 |Home=14}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=3 |Time=6:45 |Team=SEA |DrivePlays=3 |DriveLength=20 |DriveTime=0:53 |Type=RecTD |Receiver=[[Jerramy Stevens]] |QB=[[Matt Hasselbeck]] |yards=16 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Brown |Visitor=10 |Home=14}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry |Quarter=4 |Time=8:56 |Team=PIT |DrivePlays=4 |DriveLength=56 |DriveTime=1:50 |Type=RecTD |Receiver=[[Hines Ward]] |QB=[[Antwaan Randle El]] |yards=43 |kickresult=good |Kicker=Reed |Visitor=10 |Home=21}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEnd |Visitor=10 |Home=21}}\n\n===Statistical overview===\nThe Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a home game in the playoffs. The [[Green Bay Packers]], who won [[Super Bowl I]], and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who won [[Super Bowl IV]], also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.\n\nRoethlisberger finished the game having completed just 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and having also thrown two interceptions; his 22.6 [[quarterback rating]]<ref name=\"Worse Super Bowl than Peyton Manning in XLVIII\">{{cite web|title=Canzano blog: Who had a worse Super Bowl than Peyton Manning?|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/john_canzano/index.ssf/2014/02/canzano_blog_so_you_think_peyt.html}}</ref> was the lowest ever by a Super Bowl winning quarterback. He also rushed for 25 yards and a touchdown. He became the second youngest [[quarterback]] to start in a Super Bowl and the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at 23 years, 11 months.\n\nThe Steelers rushing game was paced by Willie Parker, who gained 93 yards and one touchdown on ten carries, Bettis rushed 14 times for 43 yards, converted a key first down, and allowed his team to run time off the clock late in the fourth quarter. Ward caught five passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 43-yard touchdown pass, Randle El caught three passes for 22 yards and returned two punts for 32 yards. In defeat for the Seahawks, Hasselbeck completed 26 of 49 pass attempts for 273 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Jurevicius caught 5 passes for 93 yards. Engram and Jackson also played roles, combining to gain 120 yards on eleven receptions. Alexander led all rushers in the game, accumulating 95 yards on 20 carries while also catching two passes for two yards. The Steelers were the third team to lose the turnover battle and win the game, after the [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl V]] and the Steelers in [[Super Bowl XIV]].\n\nDefensively, Taylor led the Steelers, making seven tackles, defensing two passes, and intercepting Hasselbeck; for the Seahawks, linebacker Lofa Tatupu recorded nine tackles.\n\n==Final statistics==\nSources: [http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxl NFL.com Super Bowl XL], [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&super_bowl=1&match=summary_all&year_min=1966&year_max=2016&team_id=pit&opp_id=sea&quarter=1&quarter=2&quarter=3&quarter=4&quarter=5&tr_gtlt=lt&minutes=15&seconds=00&down=0&down=1&down=2&down=3&down=4&yg_gtlt=gt&is_first_down=-1&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type=PASS&type=RUSH&type=PUNT&type=KOFF&type=ONSD&type=FG&type=XP&type=2PCR&type=2PCP&is_complete=-1&is_turnover=-1&turnover_type=interception&turnover_type=fumble&is_scoring=-1&score_type=touchdown&score_type=field_goal&score_type=safety&is_sack=-1&include_kneels=-1&no_play=0&order_by=yards Super Bowl XL Play Finder Pit], [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&super_bowl=1&match=summary_all&year_min=1966&year_max=2016&team_id=sea&opp_id=pit&quarter=1&quarter=2&quarter=3&quarter=4&quarter=5&tr_gtlt=lt&minutes=15&seconds=00&down=0&down=1&down=2&down=3&down=4&yg_gtlt=gt&is_first_down=-1&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type=PASS&type=RUSH&type=PUNT&type=KOFF&type=ONSD&type=FG&type=XP&type=2PCR&type=2PCP&is_complete=-1&is_turnover=-1&turnover_type=interception&turnover_type=fumble&is_scoring=-1&score_type=touchdown&score_type=field_goal&score_type=safety&is_sack=-1&include_kneels=-1&no_play=0&order_by=yards Super Bowl XL Play Finder Sea]\n\n===Statistical comparison===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Seattle Seahawks\n!Pittsburgh Steelers\n|-\n|First downs||20||14\n|-\n|First downs rushing||5||6\n|-\n|First downs passing||15||8\n|-\n|First downs penalty||0||0\n|-\n|Third down efficiency||5/17||8/15\n|-\n|Fourth down efficiency||1/2||0/0\n|-\n|Net yards rushing||137||181\n|-\n|Rushing attempts||25||33\n|-\n|Yards per rush||5.5||5.5\n|-\n|Passing \u2013 Completions-attempts||26/49||10/22\n|-\n|Times sacked-total yards||3\u201314||1\u20138\n|-\n|Interceptions thrown||1||2\n|-\n|Net yards passing||259||158\n|-\n|Total net yards||396||339\n|-\n|Punt returns-total yards||4\u201327||2\u201332\n|-\n|Kickoff returns-total yards||4\u201371||2\u201343\n|-\n|Interceptions-total return yards||2\u201376||1\u201324\n|-\n|Punts-average yardage||6\u201350.2||6\u201348.7\n|-\n|Fumbles-lost||0\u20130||0\u20130\n|-\n|Penalties-yards||7\u201370||3\u201320\n|-\n|Time of possession||33:02||26:58\n|-\n|Turnovers||1||2\n|}\n\n===Individual leaders===\n{{col-float|width=48%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Passing\n|-\n!\n!C/ATT<sup>1</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!INT\n!Rating\n|-\n|[[Matt Hasselbeck]]\n|26/49\n|273\n|1\n|1\n|67.8\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Rushing\n|-\n!\n!Car<sup>2</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!LG<sup>3</sup>\n!Yds/Car\n|-\n|[[Shaun Alexander]]\n|20\n|95\n|0\n|21\n|4.75\n|-\n|Matt Hasselbeck\n|3\n|35\n|0\n|18\n|11.67\n|-\n|[[Mack Strong]]\n|2\n|7\n|0\n|7\n|3.50\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks 02thru11}};\"|Seahawks Receiving\n|-\n!\n!Rec<sup>4</sup>\n!Yds\n!TD\n!LG<sup>3</sup>\n!Target<sup>5</sup>\n|-\n|[[Bobby Engram]]\n|6\n|70\n|0\n|21\n|9\n|-\n|[[Joe Jurevicius]]\n|5\n|93\n|0\n|35\n|8\n|-\n|[[Darrell Jackson]]\n|5\n|50\n|0\n|20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Jerramy Stevens]]\n|3\n|25\n|1\n|16t\n|8\n|-\n|Mack Strong\n|2\n|15\n|0\n|13\n|3\n|-\n|[[Ryan Hannam]]\n|2\n|12\n|0\n|9\n|2\n|-\n|Shaun Alexander\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|4\n|4\n|-\n|[[Maurice Morris]]\n|1\n|6\n|0\n|6\n|1\n|-\n|[[D.

Sutton became the first coach to take four schools to the NCAA tournament, and he reached the Final Four with Arkansas in 1978 and Oklahoma State in 1995 and 2004.

The 1967\u201368 Golden Eagles posted a 33\u20134 record and quickly became a consistent national contender at the community college level. Sutton left CSI in 1969 to coach at Creighton.

Kentucky was eligible for this severe penalty because it was already on probation for failing to cooperate with an investigation into an extensive scheme of payments to recruits.\nBy then, however, Sutton was already gone. In March, school president [[David Roselle]] told Sutton that he had lined up enough support on UK's athletics board to fire him unless he resigned. Rather than face all-but-certain termination, Sutton resigned. Athletic director [[Cliff Hagan]] resigned as well. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play and a ban from live television in 1989\u201390.

The Cowboys had only made postseason play three times since joining the [[Big Eight Conference]] in 1957.\n\nGiven a second chance, Sutton soon went to work on reviving the Cowboys, and his coaching career. The Pokes began to turn around almost immediately with Sutton's presence, and in 1991, Oklahoma State returned to the NCAA Tournament, ending their NCAA Tournament drought that had lasted since losing 56\u201353 to Princeton in 1983. Sutton's Cowboys advanced all the way to the Sweet Sixteen his first two seasons as head coach. Sutton cemented the Cowboys' return to the ranks of college basketball's major powers in 1995 as the Pokes, with the leadership of 'Big Country' [[Bryant Reeves]] and Randy Rutherford, captured a share of the Big 8 Conference championship and won a bid to the 1995 NCAA Final Four in Seattle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/ncaa-tournament/history/yearbyyear/1995|title=NCAA Tournament History|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=April 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n \nUnder his tutelage, the Cowboys reached the postseason 14 times in his 17 years in Stillwater (having declined an [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] bid in Sutton's sixth season as head coach), including 13 NCAA Tournament bids and two Final Four appearances. They also captured three regular-season conference titles and three conference tournament championships. His 368 wins are the second most in school history, behind only his mentor, Iba.\n\nOn January 15, 2005, the court at [[Gallagher-Iba Arena]] at Oklahoma State University was officially renamed Eddie Sutton Court. He was later honored for his contributions to the game of basketball and Oklahoma State University, on February 21, 2007.\n\nOn February 10, 2006, Eddie Sutton was in a car accident in Stillwater.

(born March 12, 1936) is a retired American [[college basketball]] coach. He was a head coach for 36 years at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level, at [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]], [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State]] (his alma mater), and the [[San Francisco Dons men's basketball|University of San Francisco]]. Sutton became the first coach to take four schools to the NCAA tournament, and he reached the Final Four with Arkansas in 1978 and Oklahoma State in 1995 and 2004. He is one of only eight major [[College basketball|college]] men's [[basketball]] coaches to have over 800 career wins.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\n\nEddie Sutton was born in [[Bucklin, Kansas]]. He played for Oklahoma State (known as Oklahoma A&M until his senior year of 1957\u20131958) under legendary coach [[Henry Iba]]. While at Oklahoma A&M Sutton became a member of [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn his college coaching career, Sutton was the head coach of [[Creighton University|Creighton]], [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State]], and [[University of San Francisco]]. He has the rare distinction of having taken two schools (Arkansas and Oklahoma State) to the [[Final Four]], and was the first coach to lead four schools to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nSutton's college coaching career began in 1967 in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], where he founded the men's basketball program at the [[College of Southern Idaho]], a community college in only its third year of existence. The 1967\u201368 Golden Eagles posted a 33\u20134 record and quickly became a consistent national contender at the community college level. Sutton left CSI in 1969 to coach at Creighton. It was with the Bluejays that he made his first coaching appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1974.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===University of Arkansas (1974-1985)===\nIn 1974, Sutton took over an underachieving Arkansas program from Lanny Van Eman. Over the next 11 seasons, Sutton compiled a record of 260-75, including five [[Southwest Conference]] championships, nine NCAA tournament appearances, and a Final Four appearance in 1978.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nHis success allowed for the renovation of [[Barnhill Arena]] from 5,200 seats to 9,000, anchored by \"The Triplets,\" [[Ron Brewer]], [[Marvin Delph]], and [[Sidney Moncrief]], a trio of basketball players all from the state of Arkansas that helped lead the Hogs to an undefeated [[Southwest Conference|SWC]] crown in 1977 and the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978 Final Four]].\n\nIn 1984, Sutton presided over Arkansas upsetting [[1983-84 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|#1 North Carolina]] and their star player [[Michael Jordan]], in Pine Bluff. Sutton left Arkansas in 1985 to succeed [[Joe B. Hall]] at the University of Kentucky. Arkansas replaced Eddie Sutton with [[Nolan Richardson]]. In 2014 Sutton was inducted into the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nashvillesportsmix.com/2014/08/nine-razorbacks-to-be-inducted-into-swc-hall-of-fame/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329065439/http://nashvillesportsmix.com/2014/08/nine-razorbacks-to-be-inducted-into-swc-hall-of-fame/ |archivedate=March 29, 2016 }}</ref> Sutton is still beloved by Razorbacks fans, today.\n\n===University of Kentucky (1985\u20131989)===\nIn 1985, Sutton took the helm of one of the nation's most prestigious college basketball programs at the University of Kentucky. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986 NCAA Tournament]]. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25-5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title (which was later vacated by the SEC) and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the [[Associated Press]] and [[United Press International|UPI]]<ref name=\"UK 1987-88\">{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Jon|title=Statistics for 1987-88|url=http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/stat1987-88.html|accessdate=July 2, 2008|publisher=bigbluehistory.net: Kentucky Wildcats Basketball Page}}</ref><ref name=\"UK Past Teams\">{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Jon|title=Kentucky Teams of the Past|url=http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/teamslist.html|accessdate=July 3, 2008|publisher=bigbluehistory.net: Kentucky Wildcats Basketball Page}}</ref> before losing to [[Villanova University|Villanova]] in the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]].\n\nHowever Sutton's tenure at Kentucky ended at the close of the 1988\u201389 season after a scandal and a losing record tarnished the school's basketball program. Kentucky entered the 1988\u201389 season lacking significant talent in their lineup. The previous season's offensive and defensive stars [[Ed Davender]], Rob Lock and [[Winston Bennett]] had all graduated from school; All-SEC sophomore [[Rex Chapman]] left school early to enter the [[1988 NBA Draft]]. Additionally, sophomore standout [[Eric Manuel]] was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit [[Shawn Kemp]] transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.<ref name=\"Commentary\">{{cite news|last=Drum|first=Keith|title=Commentary|work=United Press International|date=November 16, 1988}}</ref> As it turned out, Manuel didn't play a single game as the investigation dragged through the entire season, essentially placing the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore [[LeRon Ellis]] and freshman [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]]. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13-19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.<ref name=\"UK Past Teams\"/>\n\nThe scandal broke when it was alleged that [[Emery Worldwide]] employees discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach [[Dwane Casey]] supposedly sent to Mills' father.<ref name=\"york19881211\">York, Michael.

Kentucky was eligible for this severe penalty because it was already on probation for failing to cooperate with an investigation into an extensive scheme of payments to recruits.\nBy then, however, Sutton was already gone. In March, school president [[David Roselle]] told Sutton that he had lined up enough support on UK's athletics board to fire him unless he resigned. Rather than face all-but-certain termination, Sutton resigned. Athletic director [[Cliff Hagan]] resigned as well. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play and a ban from live television in 1989\u201390. Manuel was also banned from ever playing again for any NCAA member school.<ref name=\"SI\">Kirkpatrick, Curry.

The Cowboys had only made postseason play three times since joining the [[Big Eight Conference]] in 1957.\n\nGiven a second chance, Sutton soon went to work on reviving the Cowboys, and his coaching career. The Pokes began to turn around almost immediately with Sutton's presence, and in 1991, Oklahoma State returned to the NCAA Tournament, ending their NCAA Tournament drought that had lasted since losing 56\u201353 to Princeton in 1983. Sutton's Cowboys advanced all the way to the Sweet Sixteen his first two seasons as head coach. Sutton cemented the Cowboys' return to the ranks of college basketball's major powers in 1995 as the Pokes, with the leadership of 'Big Country' [[Bryant Reeves]] and Randy Rutherford, captured a share of the Big 8 Conference championship and won a bid to the 1995 NCAA Final Four in Seattle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/ncaa-tournament/history/yearbyyear/1995|title=NCAA Tournament History|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=April 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n \nUnder his tutelage, the Cowboys reached the postseason 14 times in his 17 years in Stillwater (having declined an [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] bid in Sutton's sixth season as head coach), including 13 NCAA Tournament bids and two Final Four appearances. They also captured three regular-season conference titles and three conference tournament championships. His 368 wins are the second most in school history, behind only his mentor, Iba.\n\nOn January 15, 2005, the court at [[Gallagher-Iba Arena]] at Oklahoma State University was officially renamed Eddie Sutton Court. He was later honored for his contributions to the game of basketball and Oklahoma State University, on February 21, 2007.\n\nOn February 10, 2006, Eddie Sutton was in a car accident in Stillwater. He was cited for [[driving under the influence]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sutton takes leave of absence; cited with DUI|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2329109|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 17, 2015|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> Witnesses say that Sutton fell in the parking lot outside Gallagher-Iba Arena just before getting into his Dodge Durango.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Randy|title=Officers' actions questioned OSU police helped coach before crash, reports show|url=http://newsok.com/officers-actions-questionedbrosu-police-helped-coach-before-crash-reports-show/article/2932187|website=The Oklahoman|accessdate=May 17, 2015|date=February 18, 2006}}</ref> He appeared slightly dazed but still got into his car and drove away. A few minutes later, he was weaving on the road, driving to the left of center. His Durango struck the back of a Suburban before swerving left, then right and off the road into a tree. Sutton was taken to the hospital; nobody was seriously injured in the accident. Sutton announced he was taking a medical leave of absence from the basketball team, citing his health problems and the accident as reasons. The games played would continue to count against his overall record, though Head Coach Designate and Sutton's son Sean would coach for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baldwin|first1=Mike|title=Sean Sutton speaks out|url=http://newsok.com/sean-sutton-speaks-outbrim-tough-enough-to-handle-this-he-says/article/2932220|website=The Oklahoman|accessdate=May 17, 2015|date=February 18, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"admits drinking\">{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Murray|title=Sutton Admits Drinking Before Accident|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BKC_OKLAHOMA_ST_SUTTON?SITE=NJHAC&SECTION=HOME|publisher=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225192034/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BKC_OKLAHOMA_ST_SUTTON?SITE=NJHAC&SECTION=HOME|archivedate=February 25, 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn February 15, 2006, Sutton read a prepared statement over the phone at an OSU press conference. He admitted he had taken prescription medication and \"bought a bottle\" of alcohol on the night of the accident. He acknowledged his past struggles with alcohol in the late 1980s in which he went to treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic, and he said he would seek treatment once again.<ref name=\"admits drinking\"/>\n\nSutton eventually resigned from his position as Head Coach at Oklahoma State on May 19, 2006.

The Roman Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity and its related concepts, as well as the parallel neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty, play major roles in structural pluralist thought.\"{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=13}}<br/>\"Concurrent with this missionary movement in Africa, both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas. Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both social gospel movements and neo-Calvinism. Catholic political activism emerged principally in Italy, France, and Spain under the inspiration of both Rerum Novarum and its early progeny and of neo-Thomism. Both formed political parties, which now fall under the general aegis of the Christian Democratic Party movement. Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of \"social pluralism\" or \"subsidiarity,\" which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the \"individual in community.\"{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}} Christian democratic political ideology advocates for a commitment to [[social market]] principles and qualified interventionism. It was conceived as a combination of modern [[democracy|democratic]] ideas and [[Christian values|traditional Christian values]], incorporating the social teachings espoused by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Pentecostal]] traditions in various parts of the world.{{sfn|Freeden|2004|p=82}}{{refn|group=nb|Pentecostals have also secured parliamentary representation, for example, in Australia, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Peru, and have helped form Christian political parties that have won parliamentary seats. A noteworthy case is Sweden's Christian Democrat Party, not only because it is in a continent where Pentecostals have struggled to make political headway but also because its Pentecostal founder, Lewi Pethrus, who challenged secularization by creating institutions to foster a Christian counterculture, was active at a time when Pentecostals in Sweden or the United States shunned politics.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} }} After [[World War II]], the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and Catholic movements of the [[Social Gospel]] and [[Neo-Thomism]], respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} Christian democracy continues to be influential in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], although it is also present in other parts of the world.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2014|p=}}\n\nIn practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] on cultural, social and moral issues, and is a supporter of [[social conservatism]], but it is considered [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] \"with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy\" as well as the environment.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}{{refn|group=nb|The basic tenets of Christian Democracy call for applying Christian principles to public policy; Christian Democratic parties tend to be socially conservative but otherwise left of center with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy.{{sfn|Kte'pi|2009|p=131}} }} Specifically with regard to its fiscal stance, Christian democracy advocates a [[Social market economy|social market economy]].{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}\n\nWorldwide, many Christian democratic parties are members of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and some also of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Examples of major Christian democratic parties include the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], the [[Austrian People's Party]], Ireland's [[Fine Gael]], the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]], the [[Aruban People's Party]], the Dutch [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] and the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Van Hecke|Gerard|2004|p=}}\n\nToday, many European Christian democratic parties are affiliated with the [[European People's Party]]. Those with [[Eurosceptic#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Eurosceptic]] views in comparison with the pro-European EPP are members of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], or the more right-wing [[European Christian Political Movement]]. Many Christian democratic parties in the Americas are affiliated with the [[Christian Democrat Organization of America]].\n\n==Political viewpoints==\nAs a generalization, it can be said that Christian democratic parties in Europe tend to be moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], and in several cases form the main conservative party in their respective countries (e.g. in Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland: [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] (CVP), [[Christian Social Party (Switzerland)|Christian Social Party]] (CSP), [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland]] (EVP), and [[Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland]] (EDU)). In Latin America, by contrast, Christian democratic parties tend to be left-leaning and to some degree influenced by [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Szulc|1965|p=102}} These generalizations, however, must be nuanced by the consideration that Christian democracy does not fit precisely into the usual categories of political thought, but rather includes elements common to several other political ideologies, including [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]], and [[social democracy]].\n\n===Economics===\nInitially, many Catholic political movements in the 19th century had opposed [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] equally as both were seen as based on materialism and social conflict.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} They instead preferred the ideal of self-sufficient peasants and the [[guild]]-organized craftsmen that many [[Rerum Novarum|Catholic encyclicals]] advocated. However, by 1914 many of these movements had later reconciled themselves to capitalism as the prevailing economic system while at the same time helping to organize Catholic workers and peasants within that system, as socialism came to be seen as the greater threat.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}\n\nConsequently, this has led to the social market economy, which has been widely influential across much of continental Europe. The social market is a largely free market economy based on a [[free price system]] and private property, but is supportive of government activity to promote competitive markets with a comprehensive [[Social welfare|social welfare system]] and effective public services to address social inequalities that result from free market outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83\u201384}} The market is seen not so much an end in itself but as a means of generating wealth in order to achieve broader social goals and to maintain societal cohesion.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=84}} This particular model of capitalism, which is sometimes called Rhine\u2013Alpine capitalism or ''social capitalism'', is contrasted to [[Anglo-Saxon model|Anglo-American capitalism]] or ''enterprise capitalism''. Whereas the former stresses partnership and cooperation, the latter is based on the unrestricted workings of market economics and as a consequence there is a willingness on the part of Christian democratic parties to practice [[Keynesian]] and [[welfarist]] policies.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=84}}\n\nIn recent decades, however, some right-leaning Christian democratic parties in Europe have adopted policies consistent with an [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] point of view but still supporting a regulated economy with a welfare state, while by contrast other Christian democrats at times seem to hold views similar to [[Christian socialism]], or the economic system of [[distributism]]. The promotion of the Christian Democratic concepts of [[sphere sovereignty]] and [[subsidiarity]] led to the creation of corporatist welfare states throughout the world that continue to exist to this day.{{refn|group=nb|The Christian democrats promoted a corporatist welfare state, based on the principles of the so-called \"sphere sovereignty\" and \"subsidiarity\" in social policy.{{sfn|Bak|van Holthoon|Krabbendam|Ayers|1996|p=56}} }} In keeping with the Christian Democratic concepts of the [[cultural mandate]] and the [[preferential option for the poor]], Christian justice is viewed as demanding that the welfare of all people, especially the poor and vulnerable, must be protected because every human being has dignity, being made in the image of God.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}{{sfn|Mainwaring|2003|p=181}} In many countries, Christian Democrats organized labor unions that competed with Communist and social democratic unions, in contrast to conservativism's stance against worker organizations. Standing in solidarity with these labor unions, In Belgium for example, Christian Democrats have lobbied for Sunday [[blue laws]] that guarantee workers, as well as civil servants, a day of rest in line with historic [[Sabbatarianism|Christian Sabbath principles]].{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=119}}\n\n===Social policies===\nChristian democrats are usually [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and generally have a relatively skeptical stance towards [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]], although some Christian democratic parties have accepted the limited legalization of both. Christian Democrats have also supported the [[prohibition of drugs]].{{refn|group=nb|Conservatives, including the Christian Democrats, favor an abstinence strategy that aims at a controlled use of legal drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, and medical drugs, on the one hand, and prohibiting the use of illegal drugs (whether soft or hard), on the other.{{sfn|Kerbo|Strasser|2000|p=101}}{{sfn|Coleman|Kerbo|Ramos|2001|p=413}} }} Christian democratic parties are often likely to assert the [[Christianity|Christian]] heritage of their country, and to affirm explicitly [[Christian ethics]], rather than adopting a more liberal or secular stance;{{refn|group=nb|The main ideological and integrative theme present from the start concerned an emphasis on general Christian values, both as a moral rejection of the atheist, immoral and materialist Nazism and as a manner of distinction vis \u00e0 vis social democracy. The thrust of the Christian democratic argument was that politics had to be founded in Christianity and that a moral recovery was a prerequisite for social and economic recuperation. It was imperative to concede the importance of Christian ethics after an epoch of such inhuman and atheist cruelty.(Heidenheimer 1960:33-4; Mintzel 1982:133){{sfn|van Kersbergen|2003|p=63}} }} at the same time, Christian Democratic parties enshrine [[confessional liberty]].{{sfn|Heffernan Schindler|2008|p=144}} Christian Democracy fosters an \"[[ecumenical]] unity achieved on the religious level against the [[state atheism|atheism]] of the government in the Communist countries.\"{{refn|group=nb|European Christian Democracy after the Second World War really represented a common political front against the People's Democracies, that is, Christian Democracy was a kind of ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the atheism of the government in the Communist countries.{{sfn|Dussel|1981|p=217}} }}\n\nChristian Democrats' views include: Traditional moral values (on marriage, abortion, prohibition of drugs etc.),{{sfn|Poppa|2010|p=12}} opposition to [[secularization]], opposition to [[state atheism]], a view of the evolutionary (as opposed to revolutionary) development of society, an emphasis on law and order, and a rejection of [[Marxism-Leninism|communism]].{{sfn|Dussel|1981|p=217}}{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} Christian democrats are open to change (for example, in the structure of society) and not necessarily supportive of the social status quo, and have an emphasis on human rights and individual initiative. A rejection of [[secularism]], and an emphasis on the fact that the individual is part of a community and has duties towards it. An emphasis on the community, social justice and solidarity, support for a [[welfare state]], [[labor unions]] and support for regulation of market forces.{{sfn|Matlary|Veiden |Hansen|2011|p=}} Most European Christian Democrats reject the concept of [[class struggle]] (although less so in some Latin American countries, which have been influenced by [[liberation theology]]), opposing both excessive State institutions and unregulated capitalism in favor of robust non-governmental, non-profit, intermediary institutions to deliver social services and [[social insurance]].\n\nGeoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood have noted that \"Christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.\"{{sfn|Roberts|Hogwood|1997|p=}}\n\nChristian Democrats hold that the various sectors of society (such as education, family, economy and state) have autonomy and responsibility over their own sphere, a concept known as [[sphere sovereignty]].{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=133}} One sphere ought not to dictate the obligations of another social entity; for example, the sphere of the state is not permitted to interfere with the raising of children, a role that belongs to sphere of the family.{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=133}} Within the sphere of government, Christian Democrats maintain that civil issues should first be addressed at the lowest level of government before being examined at a higher level, a doctrine known as [[subsidiarity]].{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}} These concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity are considered to be cornerstones of Christian Democracy political ideology.{{sfn|Lamberts|1997|p=401}}\n\nAs advocates of environmentalism, Christian democrats support the principle of [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]], which upholds the idea that humans should safeguard the planet for future generations of life.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nThe origins of Christian democracy go back to the [[French Revolution]], where initially French republicanism and the Catholic church were deeply hostile to one another as the revolutionary government had attacked the church, confiscated the church's lands, persecuted its priests and had attempted to establish a new religion around reason and the supreme being.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}} After the decades following the French revolution, the Catholic church saw the rise of [[liberalism]] as a threat to catholic values. The rise of capitalism and the resulting industrialization and urbanization of society were seen to be destroying the traditional communal and family life. According to the Catholic Church [[Economic liberalism|liberal economics]] promoted selfishness and materialism with the liberal emphasis on individualism, tolerance, and free expression enabled all kinds of self-indulgence and permissiveness to thrive.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}}\n\nConsequently, for much of the 19th century the Catholic church was hostile to democracy and liberalism. Later, however, many political Catholic movements were formed in European countries advocating reconciling Catholicism with liberalism, if not democracy. From about the 1870s, political Catholicism emerged based on the idea that it was to the Church's advantage to participate in the modern political process,{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} and it became a significant force in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Austria. These Catholic political movements tended to have many similar policies of opposition to liberal secularism, civil marriage and state control of education. They were also against the common view of liberalism that church and state must be separated.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} Consequently, they were closely connected to the church and confined to the faithful. The first priority was privileging Catholic teaching and the church in politics. Democracy was chosen because it was an expedient political tool, not because democracy was seen as an ideal.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}\n\nIn [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, Christian democratic parties were founded by more conservative Protestants in reaction to secularization.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} In the Netherlands, for instance, the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] was founded in 1879 by conservative Protestants; it institutionalized early 19th century opposition against the ideas from the French Revolution on popular sovereignty and held that government derived its authority from God, not from the people. It was a response to the liberal ideas that predominated in political life. The [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] of Sweden, rooted in the [[Pentecostal]] religious tradition, has a similar history.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nLargely as a result of the [[Pope|papal]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' of [[Pope Leo XIII]], in which the [[Holy See|Vatican]] recognized workers' misery and agreed that something should be done about it, in reaction to the rise of the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union]] movements. The position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on this matter was further clarified in subsequent encyclicals, such as ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1931, ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1967, ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, and ''[[Caritas in veritate]]'' by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.{{sfn|Sturzo|1947|p= 5}} At the same time, \"Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both [[social gospel]] movements and [[neo-Calvinism]]\".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} After [[World War II]], \"both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas\".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} Modern authors important to the formation of Christian democratic ideology include [[Emmanuel Mounier]] and [[Jacques Maritain]].{{sfn|Pombeni|2000}} [[John Witte Jr.|John Witte]], explaining the origin of Christian democracy, states that:\n{{quotation|Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies.

Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of \"social pluralism\" or \"subsidiarity,\" which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the \"individual in community.\"{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}}\n\nAs such, Christian democracy has been adopted by Roman Catholics as well as many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Christian democracy has evolved considerably since then, and it is no longer the Catholic ideology of [[distributism]], although it is based on Catholic social teaching, as outlined in the 2006 official \"Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church\". (In Germany, for example, the Christian Democratic Party emerged as a grouping dominated by Rhenish and Westphalian Catholics, but also encompassed the more conservative elements of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] population.) Following [[World War&nbsp;II]], Christian democracy was seen as a neutral and unifying voice of compassionate conservatism, and distinguished itself from the [[far right]]. It gave a voice to \"conservatives of the heart\", particularly in Germany, who had detested [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime yet agreed with the right on many issues.\n\nSome Christian democratic parties, particularly in Europe, no longer emphasize religion and have become much more [[secular]] in recent years. Also within Europe, two essentially Islamic parties, the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] and Turkey's ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (usually known by the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] acronym AKP, for ''Adalet ve Kalk\u0131nma Partisi'') have moved towards the tradition. The Democratic League of Kosovo is now a full member of the Centrist Democrat International ''(see [[#Christian democracy around the world|below]])''. {{Citation needed|reason=LDK is not on the list of http://idc-cdi.com/en/parties/|date=June 2017 }}\n\nChristian democracy can trace its philosophical roots back to [[Thomas Aquinas]] and his thoughts on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[ontology]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} According to Aquinas, [[human rights]] are based on [[natural law]] and defined as the things that humans need to function properly. For example, food is a human right because without food humans cannot function properly. Christian Democratic initiatives based on its philosophy also have practical and political results in the movement's direction.  Christian Democrats believe in the importance of intermediary organizations that operate in between the individual and the state.  Therefore, they support labor unions but in many countries organized their own Christian trade unions separate from socialist unions.  These unions in turn formed the strong left wing of many CD parties.  Christian democratic opposition to secularism and support of religious organizations as intermediary organizations led to support for church operated schools, hospitals, charities and even social insurance funds. This resulted in strong Christian Democratic support for the government (or mandatory payroll tax) social welfare funding of these institutions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n==Christian democracy around the world== <!--Linked from above text.-->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Propaganda Dc.jpg|360px|right]] -->\n{{Main|List of Christian democratic parties}}\n\nThe international organization of Christian democratic parties, the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI), formerly known as the Christian Democratic International, is the second largest international political organization in the world (second only to the [[Socialist International]]). European Christian democratic parties have their own regional organization called the [[European People's Party]], which form the largest group in the [[European Parliament]], the [[European People's Party Group]].\n\n===Latin America===\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{expand section|date=June 2008}}<!--\"Among others\" doesn't cut it.-->\n}}\nChristian democracy has been especially important in [[Politics of Chile|Chile]] ''(see [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]])'' and Venezuela (see [[COPEI]]{{snd}} Christian Democratic Party of Venezuela), among others, and partly also in [[Politics of Mexico|Mexico]], starting with the ascendancy of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] in 2000, followed by [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] ''(see [[National Action Party (Mexico)]])''. Cuba counts with several Christian democratic political associations, both on the island and in exile. The most significant is perhaps the Movimiento Cristiano de Liberaci\u00f3n (MCL) led by Cuban dissident [[Oswaldo Pay\u00e1]], who was killed in a tragic automobile accident in the summer of 2012 and has been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In Uruguay, the [[Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay]], although numerically small, was instrumental in the creation of the leftist [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] in 1971.\n\n===Australia===\nChristian democratic parties in Australia include the [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] (regarded by some as a conservative party), the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]] (regarded by some as a social democratic party), and the former [[Family First Party]] (regarded by some as a liberal democratic party).\n\nThe Democratic Labor Party (DLP) was formed in 1955 as a split from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[New South Wales]], state executive members, parliamentarians and branch members associated with the Industrial Groups or [[B.&nbsp;A. Santamaria]] and \"The Movement\" (and therefore strongly identified with [[Roman Catholicism]]) were expelled from the party, and formed the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in [[Queensland]], with the resulting group subsequently joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]] at various times, though it was much stronger in the former mentioned states. This party was in agreement with the ruling conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties on many issues, which resulted in their [[Ranked voting systems|preferencing]] of these parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist and socially compassionate than the Liberals. The DLP heavily lost ground in the federal election of 1974 that saw its primary vote cut by nearly two-thirds, and the election of an ALP government. The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party (now the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]]). Though his party was effectively gone, Santamaria and his National Civic Council took a strong diametrically opposed stance to dominant [[Third Way]]/[[neoliberal]]/[[New Right]] tendencies within both the ALP and Liberal parties throughout the eighties and early nineties.\n\nIn 2006, the new DLP experienced a resurgence. The successor party struggled through decades of Victorian elections before finally gaining a parliamentary seat when the Victorian upper house was redesigned. Nevertheless, its electoral support is still very small in Victoria (around 2%). It has recently reformed state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. In the [[2010 Australian federal election]], the DLP won the sixth senate seat in Victoria, giving it representation in the [[Australian Senate]].<ref name=\"AusCon\" />\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] (initially known as the \"Call to Australia\" party) is identified with [[Protestantism]] and the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum. It is active in state politics. It gained 9.1% of the vote in the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) state election of 1981. This party had some very similar social policies to the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]]. Its support base has generally been restricted to NSW and [[Western Australia]], where it usually gains between 2\u20134% of votes, with its support being minuscule in other states. It has had two members of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] for most of its existence and currently holds the Balance of Power.<ref name=\"cdp.org.au\" /> The [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|CDP]] saw a surge in support during the 2016 Federal Election with a 96% increase in NSW.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/media-releases/2016-federal-election-results-update/|title=2016 Federal Election Results Update|website=cdp.org.au|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Family First Party]] is a former political party which was linked with [[Pentecostal Church]] and other smaller Christian denominations, and was also identified with the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum. It has had one or two members in the SA parliament since 2002, and in 2004 also managed to elect a Victorian senator. Its electoral support is small, with the largest constituencies being [[South Australia]] (4\u20136%), and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (around 4%). Family First generally receives lower support in national elections than in state elections. [[Family First Party|Family First]] was merged with the [[Australian Conservatives]] Party in 2017.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\" />\n\n===North America===\nIn the [[United States]], the [[American Solidarity Party]] is a minor third party which identifies as a Christian democratic party.{{sfn|Longenecker|2016|ps=:In 2011 the Christian Democratic Party USA was formed, and after the 2012 election it was re-named as the American Solidarity Party.

The Roman Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity and its related concepts, as well as the parallel neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty, play major roles in structural pluralist thought.\"{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=13}}<br/>\"Concurrent with this missionary movement in Africa, both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas. Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both social gospel movements and neo-Calvinism. Catholic political activism emerged principally in Italy, France, and Spain under the inspiration of both Rerum Novarum and its early progeny and of neo-Thomism. Both formed political parties, which now fall under the general aegis of the Christian Democratic Party movement. Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of \"social pluralism\" or \"subsidiarity,\" which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the \"individual in community.\"{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}} Christian democratic political ideology advocates for a commitment to [[social market]] principles and qualified interventionism. It was conceived as a combination of modern [[democracy|democratic]] ideas and [[Christian values|traditional Christian values]], incorporating the social teachings espoused by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Pentecostal]] traditions in various parts of the world.{{sfn|Freeden|2004|p=82}}{{refn|group=nb|Pentecostals have also secured parliamentary representation, for example, in Australia, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Peru, and have helped form Christian political parties that have won parliamentary seats. A noteworthy case is Sweden's Christian Democrat Party, not only because it is in a continent where Pentecostals have struggled to make political headway but also because its Pentecostal founder, Lewi Pethrus, who challenged secularization by creating institutions to foster a Christian counterculture, was active at a time when Pentecostals in Sweden or the United States shunned politics.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} }} After [[World War II]], the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and Catholic movements of the [[Social Gospel]] and [[Neo-Thomism]], respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} Christian democracy continues to be influential in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], although it is also present in other parts of the world.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2014|p=}}\n\nIn practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] on cultural, social and moral issues, and is a supporter of [[social conservatism]], but it is considered [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] \"with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy\" as well as the environment.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}{{refn|group=nb|The basic tenets of Christian Democracy call for applying Christian principles to public policy; Christian Democratic parties tend to be socially conservative but otherwise left of center with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy.{{sfn|Kte'pi|2009|p=131}} }} Specifically with regard to its fiscal stance, Christian democracy advocates a social market economy.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}\n\nWorldwide, many Christian democratic parties are members of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and some also of the [[International Democrat Union]]. Examples of major Christian democratic parties include the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], the [[Austrian People's Party]], Ireland's [[Fine Gael]], the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]], the [[Aruban People's Party]], the Dutch [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] and the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Van Hecke|Gerard|2004|p=}}\n\nToday, many European Christian democratic parties are affiliated with the [[European People's Party]]. Those with [[Eurosceptic#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Eurosceptic]] views in comparison with the pro-European EPP are members of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], or the more right-wing [[European Christian Political Movement]]. Many Christian democratic parties in the Americas are affiliated with the [[Christian Democrat Organization of America]].\n\n==Political viewpoints==\nAs a generalization, it can be said that Christian democratic parties in Europe tend to be moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], and in several cases form the main conservative party in their respective countries (e.g. in Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland: [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]] (CVP), [[Christian Social Party (Switzerland)|Christian Social Party]] (CSP), [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland]] (EVP), and [[Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland]] (EDU)). In Latin America, by contrast, Christian democratic parties tend to be left-leaning and to some degree influenced by [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Szulc|1965|p=102}} These generalizations, however, must be nuanced by the consideration that Christian democracy does not fit precisely into the usual categories of political thought, but rather includes elements common to several other political ideologies, including [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]], and [[social democracy]].\n\n===Economics===\nInitially, many Catholic political movements in the 19th century had opposed [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] equally as both were seen as based on materialism and social conflict.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} They instead preferred the ideal of self-sufficient peasants and the [[guild]]-organized craftsmen that many [[Rerum Novarum|Catholic encyclicals]] advocated. However, by 1914 many of these movements had later reconciled themselves to capitalism as the prevailing economic system while at the same time helping to organize Catholic workers and peasants within that system, as socialism came to be seen as the greater threat.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}\n\nConsequently, this has led to the social market economy, which has been widely influential across much of continental Europe. The social market is a largely free market economy based on a [[free price system]] and private property, but is supportive of government activity to promote competitive markets with a comprehensive [[Social welfare|social welfare system]] and effective public services to address social inequalities that result from free market outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83\u201384}} The market is seen not so much an end in itself but as a means of generating wealth in order to achieve broader social goals and to maintain societal cohesion.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=84}} This particular model of capitalism, which is sometimes called Rhine\u2013Alpine capitalism or ''social capitalism'', is contrasted to [[Anglo-Saxon model|Anglo-American capitalism]] or ''enterprise capitalism''. Whereas the former stresses partnership and cooperation, the latter is based on the unrestricted workings of market economics and as a consequence there is a willingness on the part of Christian democratic parties to practice [[Keynesian]] and [[welfarist]] policies.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=84}}\n\nIn recent decades, however, some right-leaning Christian democratic parties in Europe have adopted policies consistent with an [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] point of view but still supporting a regulated economy with a welfare state, while by contrast other Christian democrats at times seem to hold views similar to [[Christian socialism]], or the economic system of [[distributism]]. The promotion of the Christian Democratic concepts of [[sphere sovereignty]] and [[subsidiarity]] led to the creation of corporatist welfare states throughout the world that continue to exist to this day.{{refn|group=nb|The Christian democrats promoted a corporatist welfare state, based on the principles of the so-called \"sphere sovereignty\" and \"subsidiarity\" in social policy.{{sfn|Bak|van Holthoon|Krabbendam|Ayers|1996|p=56}} }} In keeping with the Christian Democratic concepts of the [[cultural mandate]] and the [[preferential option for the poor]], Christian justice is viewed as demanding that the welfare of all people, especially the poor and vulnerable, must be protected because every human being has dignity, being made in the image of God.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}{{sfn|Mainwaring|2003|p=181}} In many countries, Christian Democrats organized labor unions that competed with Communist and social democratic unions, in contrast to conservativism's stance against worker organizations. Standing in solidarity with these labor unions, In Belgium for example, Christian Democrats have lobbied for Sunday [[blue laws]] that guarantee workers, as well as civil servants, a day of rest in line with historic [[Sabbatarianism|Christian Sabbath principles]].{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=119}}\n\n===Social policies===\nChristian democrats are usually [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and generally have a relatively skeptical stance towards [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]], although some Christian democratic parties have accepted the limited legalization of both. Christian Democrats have also supported the [[prohibition of drugs]].{{refn|group=nb|Conservatives, including the Christian Democrats, favor an abstinence strategy that aims at a controlled use of legal drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, and medical drugs, on the one hand, and prohibiting the use of illegal drugs (whether soft or hard), on the other.{{sfn|Kerbo|Strasser|2000|p=101}}{{sfn|Coleman|Kerbo|Ramos|2001|p=413}} }} Christian democratic parties are often likely to assert the [[Christianity|Christian]] heritage of their country, and to affirm explicitly [[Christian ethics]], rather than adopting a more liberal or secular stance;{{refn|group=nb|The main ideological and integrative theme present from the start concerned an emphasis on general Christian values, both as a moral rejection of the atheist, immoral and materialist Nazism and as a manner of distinction vis \u00e0 vis social democracy. The thrust of the Christian democratic argument was that politics had to be founded in Christianity and that a moral recovery was a prerequisite for social and economic recuperation. It was imperative to concede the importance of Christian ethics after an epoch of such inhuman and atheist cruelty.(Heidenheimer 1960:33-4; Mintzel 1982:133){{sfn|van Kersbergen|2003|p=63}} }} at the same time, Christian Democratic parties enshrine [[confessional liberty]].{{sfn|Heffernan Schindler|2008|p=144}} Christian Democracy fosters an \"[[ecumenical]] unity achieved on the religious level against the [[state atheism|atheism]] of the government in the Communist countries.\"{{refn|group=nb|European Christian Democracy after the Second World War really represented a common political front against the People's Democracies, that is, Christian Democracy was a kind of ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the atheism of the government in the Communist countries.{{sfn|Dussel|1981|p=217}} }}\n\nChristian Democrats' views include: Traditional moral values (on marriage, abortion, prohibition of drugs etc.),{{sfn|Poppa|2010|p=12}} opposition to [[secularization]], opposition to [[state atheism]], a view of the evolutionary (as opposed to revolutionary) development of society, an emphasis on law and order, and a rejection of [[Marxism-Leninism|communism]].{{sfn|Dussel|1981|p=217}}{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} Christian democrats are open to change (for example, in the structure of society) and not necessarily supportive of the social status quo, and have an emphasis on human rights and individual initiative. A rejection of [[secularism]], and an emphasis on the fact that the individual is part of a community and has duties towards it. An emphasis on the community, social justice and solidarity, support for a [[welfare state]], [[labor unions]] and support for regulation of market forces.{{sfn|Matlary|Veiden |Hansen|2011|p=}} Most European Christian Democrats reject the concept of [[class struggle]] (although less so in some Latin American countries, which have been influenced by [[liberation theology]]), opposing both excessive State institutions and unregulated capitalism in favor of robust non-governmental, non-profit, intermediary institutions to deliver social services and [[social insurance]].\n\nGeoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood have noted that \"Christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.\"{{sfn|Roberts|Hogwood|1997|p=}}\n\nChristian Democrats hold that the various sectors of society (such as education, family, economy and state) have autonomy and responsibility over their own sphere, a concept known as [[sphere sovereignty]].{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=133}} One sphere ought not to dictate the obligations of another social entity; for example, the sphere of the state is not permitted to interfere with the raising of children, a role that belongs to sphere of the family.{{sfn|Monsma|2012|p=133}} Within the sphere of government, Christian Democrats maintain that civil issues should first be addressed at the lowest level of government before being examined at a higher level, a doctrine known as [[subsidiarity]].{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}} These concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity are considered to be cornerstones of Christian Democracy political ideology.{{sfn|Lamberts|1997|p=401}}\n\nAs advocates of environmentalism, Christian democrats support the principle of [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]], which upholds the idea that humans should safeguard the planet for future generations of life.{{sfn|Vervliet|2009|pp=48\u201351}}\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nThe origins of Christian democracy go back to the [[French Revolution]], where initially French republicanism and the Catholic church were deeply hostile to one another as the revolutionary government had attacked the church, confiscated the church's lands, persecuted its priests and had attempted to establish a new religion around reason and the supreme being.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}} After the decades following the French revolution, the Catholic church saw the rise of [[liberalism]] as a threat to catholic values. The rise of capitalism and the resulting industrialization and urbanization of society were seen to be destroying the traditional communal and family life. According to the Catholic Church [[Economic liberalism|liberal economics]] promoted selfishness and materialism with the liberal emphasis on individualism, tolerance, and free expression enabled all kinds of self-indulgence and permissiveness to thrive.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=59}}\n\nConsequently, for much of the 19th century the Catholic church was hostile to democracy and liberalism. Later, however, many political Catholic movements were formed in European countries advocating reconciling Catholicism with liberalism, if not democracy. From about the 1870s, political Catholicism emerged based on the idea that it was to the Church's advantage to participate in the modern political process,{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} and it became a significant force in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Austria. These Catholic political movements tended to have many similar policies of opposition to liberal secularism, civil marriage and state control of education. They were also against the common view of liberalism that church and state must be separated.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}} Consequently, they were closely connected to the church and confined to the faithful. The first priority was privileging Catholic teaching and the church in politics. Democracy was chosen because it was an expedient political tool, not because democracy was seen as an ideal.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=60}}\n\nIn [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, Christian democratic parties were founded by more conservative Protestants in reaction to secularization.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }} In the Netherlands, for instance, the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] was founded in 1879 by conservative Protestants; it institutionalized early 19th century opposition against the ideas from the French Revolution on popular sovereignty and held that government derived its authority from God, not from the people. It was a response to the liberal ideas that predominated in political life. The [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] of Sweden, rooted in the [[Pentecostal]] religious tradition, has a similar history.{{sfn|Robeck|Yong|2014|p=178 }}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nLargely as a result of the [[Pope|papal]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' of [[Pope Leo XIII]], in which the [[Holy See|Vatican]] recognized workers' misery and agreed that something should be done about it, in reaction to the rise of the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union]] movements. The position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on this matter was further clarified in subsequent encyclicals, such as ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1931, ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1967, ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, and ''[[Caritas in veritate]]'' by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.{{sfn|Sturzo|1947|p= 5}} At the same time, \"Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both [[social gospel]] movements and [[neo-Calvinism]]\".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} After [[World War II]], \"both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas\".{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} Modern authors important to the formation of Christian democratic ideology include [[Emmanuel Mounier]] and [[Jacques Maritain]].{{sfn|Pombeni|2000}} [[John Witte Jr.|John Witte]], explaining the origin of Christian democracy, states that:\n{{quotation|Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of \"social pluralism\" or \"subsidiarity,\" which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the \"individual in community.\"{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}}}}\n\nAs such, Christian democracy has been adopted by Roman Catholics as well as many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Christian democracy has evolved considerably since then, and it is no longer the Catholic ideology of [[distributism]], although it is based on Catholic social teaching, as outlined in the 2006 official \"Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church\". (In Germany, for example, the Christian Democratic Party emerged as a grouping dominated by Rhenish and Westphalian Catholics, but also encompassed the more conservative elements of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] population.) Following [[World War&nbsp;II]], Christian democracy was seen as a neutral and unifying voice of compassionate conservatism, and distinguished itself from the [[far right]]. It gave a voice to \"conservatives of the heart\", particularly in Germany, who had detested [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime yet agreed with the right on many issues.\n\nSome Christian democratic parties, particularly in Europe, no longer emphasize religion and have become much more [[secular]] in recent years. Also within Europe, two essentially Islamic parties, the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] and Turkey's ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (usually known by the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] acronym AKP, for ''Adalet ve Kalk\u0131nma Partisi'') have moved towards the tradition. The Democratic League of Kosovo is now a full member of the Centrist Democrat International ''(see [[#Christian democracy around the world|below]])''. {{Citation needed|reason=LDK is not on the list of http://idc-cdi.com/en/parties/|date=June 2017 }}\n\nChristian democracy can trace its philosophical roots back to [[Thomas Aquinas]] and his thoughts on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[ontology]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.{{sfn|Witte|1993|p=9}} According to Aquinas, [[human rights]] are based on [[natural law]] and defined as the things that humans need to function properly. For example, food is a human right because without food humans cannot function properly. Christian Democratic initiatives based on its philosophy also have practical and political results in the movement's direction.  Christian Democrats believe in the importance of intermediary organizations that operate in between the individual and the state.  Therefore, they support labor unions but in many countries organized their own Christian trade unions separate from socialist unions.  These unions in turn formed the strong left wing of many CD parties.  Christian democratic opposition to secularism and support of religious organizations as intermediary organizations led to support for church operated schools, hospitals, charities and even social insurance funds. This resulted in strong Christian Democratic support for the government (or mandatory payroll tax) social welfare funding of these institutions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n==Christian democracy around the world== <!--Linked from above text.-->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Propaganda Dc.jpg|360px|right]] -->\n{{Main|List of Christian democratic parties}}\n\nThe international organization of Christian democratic parties, the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI), formerly known as the Christian Democratic International, is the second largest international political organization in the world (second only to the [[Socialist International]]). European Christian democratic parties have their own regional organization called the [[European People's Party]], which form the largest group in the [[European Parliament]], the [[European People's Party Group]].\n\n===Latin America===\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{expand section|date=June 2008}}<!--\"Among others\" doesn't cut it.-->\n}}\nChristian democracy has been especially important in [[Politics of Chile|Chile]] ''(see [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]])'' and Venezuela (see [[COPEI]]{{snd}} Christian Democratic Party of Venezuela), among others, and partly also in [[Politics of Mexico|Mexico]], starting with the ascendancy of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] in 2000, followed by [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]] ''(see [[National Action Party (Mexico)]])''. Cuba counts with several Christian democratic political associations, both on the island and in exile. The most significant is perhaps the Movimiento Cristiano de Liberaci\u00f3n (MCL) led by Cuban dissident [[Oswaldo Pay\u00e1]], who was killed in a tragic automobile accident in the summer of 2012 and has been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In Uruguay, the [[Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay]], although numerically small, was instrumental in the creation of the leftist [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] in 1971.\n\n===Australia===\nChristian democratic parties in Australia include the [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] (regarded by some as a conservative party), the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]] (regarded by some as a social democratic party), and the former [[Family First Party]] (regarded by some as a liberal democratic party).\n\nThe Democratic Labor Party (DLP) was formed in 1955 as a split from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[New South Wales]], state executive members, parliamentarians and branch members associated with the Industrial Groups or [[B.&nbsp;A. Santamaria]] and \"The Movement\" (and therefore strongly identified with [[Roman Catholicism]]) were expelled from the party, and formed the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in [[Queensland]], with the resulting group subsequently joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]] at various times, though it was much stronger in the former mentioned states. This party was in agreement with the ruling conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties on many issues, which resulted in their [[Ranked voting systems|preferencing]] of these parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist and socially compassionate than the Liberals. The DLP heavily lost ground in the federal election of 1974 that saw its primary vote cut by nearly two-thirds, and the election of an ALP government. The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party (now the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]]). Though his party was effectively gone, Santamaria and his National Civic Council took a strong diametrically opposed stance to dominant [[Third Way]]/[[neoliberal]]/[[New Right]] tendencies within both the ALP and Liberal parties throughout the eighties and early nineties.\n\nIn 2006, the new DLP experienced a resurgence. The successor party struggled through decades of Victorian elections before finally gaining a parliamentary seat when the Victorian upper house was redesigned. Nevertheless, its electoral support is still very small in Victoria (around 2%). It has recently reformed state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. In the [[2010 Australian federal election]], the DLP won the sixth senate seat in Victoria, giving it representation in the [[Australian Senate]].<ref name=\"AusCon\" />\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] (initially known as the \"Call to Australia\" party) is identified with [[Protestantism]] and the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum. It is active in state politics. It gained 9.1% of the vote in the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) state election of 1981. This party had some very similar social policies to the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]]. Its support base has generally been restricted to NSW and [[Western Australia]], where it usually gains between 2\u20134% of votes, with its support being minuscule in other states.

Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.

Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.

K. S. Iyengar]] and [[Indra Devi]].\n\nThe book's thesis is that modern yoga progressed in three stages from its pre-1900 state to what is observed today. Before 1900, [[ha\u1e6dha yoga]] was the despised religious practice of a small minority on the fringes of Indian society. In the first stage, pioneers such as Yogendra and Kuvalayananda treated yoga as the subject of medical inquiry, making it both secular and socially acceptable. Next, advocates of exercise brought standing poses from gymnastics into yoga: Pant Pratinidhi advocated [[Surya Namaskar]] (the sun salutation), a jumped sequence of poses, as daily exercise, while Krishnamacharya incorporated those poses and others as [[standing asanas]] in his yoga, along with the jumped transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) between them, making yoga dynamic. Finally, two pupils of Krishnamacharya, [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] and [[Indra Devi]], resacralised yoga, connecting the practice of asanas to ancient yoga tradition, and helped to spread yoga across the Western world.\n\nCritics, both academics and yoga teachers, broadly welcomed the book, noting Goldberg's many years of study and its detailed account of yoga's transformations. Others were more doubtful, noting the book's lack of an introduction, overview, or account of yoga's historical context.\n\n==Context==\n\nThe modern practice of [[yoga as exercise|yoga as a form of exercise]] developed from medieval [[ha\u1e6dha yoga]] in the 20th century by discarding most of its practices and focussing on [[asana]]s, physical postures. At the same time, it acquired an element of [[aerobic exercise]], initially through the adoption from [[physical culture]] of [[Surya Namaskar]], the series of postures connected by flowing movements known as the sun salutation. In some modern styles of yoga, these flowing movements have developed into [[vinyasa]]s, connecting sequences used throughout the yoga session.{{sfn|Goldberg|2016|p=xi}}\n\n==Book==\n[[File:Path of Modern Yoga acc to Goldberg 2016.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Goldberg divides the path of modern yoga into three steps, corresponding to the three parts of the book: Medicalisation, becoming Dynamic, and Resacralisation.]]\n\n===Synopsis===\n\n''The Path of Modern Yoga'', based on 10 years of research, examines the history of modern [[asana]]-based yoga through the lives of eleven pioneering figures: [[Yogendra|Sri Yogendra]]; [[Swami Kuvalayananda]]; [[Seetharaman Sundaram]]; [[Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]]; [[Swami Sivananda]]; the bodybuilder [[K.

These include Engadget Classic (the original Engadget blog), Engadget Mobile, Engadget HD and Engadget Alt. As of late 2013, these editions exist but have been wrapped into Engadget Classic. In March 2014, a UK edition of Engadget also launched to target the developing European tech market.\n\nLaunched in March 2004, Engadget is updated multiple times a day with articles on gadgets and consumer electronics.

Torrone was the host for the first 22 episodes of the podcast at which point Eric Rice took over. Eric Rice is known for his own podcast, called The Eric Rice Show and has also produced podcasts for [[Weblogs, Inc.]]. Eric hosted and produced 4 episodes of the podcast for Engadget until the show was taken over by Peter Rojas and Ryan Block. The podcast was hosted by Editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky along with editors Paul Miller and [[Nilay Patel]] with occasional special guests until their 2011 departure. The podcast was produced by Trent Wolbe under Topolsky's editorship and continued to be under Tim Stevens until December 2012.\n\nThe topic of discussion for the podcast is technology-related and closely linked to events that have happened during the week in the world of technology. The show generally lasts an hour or more. The show is normally weekly, however, the frequency can change, especially during special events. When events such as the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) and the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) occur, the podcast has been known to be broadcast daily.\n\nThe Engadget podcast is available as a subscription through [[iTunes]] and as an [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed. Alternatively, it can be downloaded directly from the site in either MP3, [[Ogg]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[m4b]] format. The m4b version features images related to the current topic of discussion and can be displayed in iTunes or on a compatible player.\n\nEngadget started doing live podcasts, usually broadcasting Thursday or Friday afternoons hosted by Ben Gilbert and Terrence O'Brien.

The magazine was born from Tim Stevens' desire to provide a different, distilled look at a week's worth of Engadget news, and to enable readers to enjoy that coverage without the frantic nature of the online experience being necessarily attached.

As of 2014, the show is cancelled.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Trademarks ===\nIn early 2006, Engadget reported that they were victims of their likeness being stolen and used as a store name at a mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Some employees suggested that AOL was sacrificing journalism for page views and that it would be difficult for the organization to apply a 'one size fits all' business model to reporting. The group set up a \"placeholder site\", ''[[This Is My Next]]'', while they developed a new technology news site in partnership with [[Vox Media]]. The new site, called ''[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]'', was launched on November 1, 2011.\n\n==Awards==\nEngadget has been nominated for numerous awards, including 2004 [[Bloggies|Bloggie]] for Best Technology Weblog, and 2005 Bloggies for Best Computers or Technology Weblog and Best Group Weblog; Engadget won Best Tech Blog in the 2004 and 2005 Weblog Awards.\n\n''The Engadget Show'' won the 2011 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in Consumer Electronics,<ref>{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Nilay |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/04/engadget-wins-the-peoples-voice-webby-in-consumer-electronics/ |title=wins the People's Voice Webby in Consumer Electronics, and you can win a Droid Incredible! |work=Engadget |date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> while also winning the official Webby in Consumer Electronics (voted on by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Tim |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/04/we-won-some-webby-awards-and-now-you-can-win-a-blackberry-playb/ |title=We won some Webby Awards, and now you can win a BlackBerry PlayBook! |work=Engadget |date=May 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Engadget}}\n*{{Official website|www.engadget.com}}\n\n{{Verizon Media}}\n\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2004]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Technology blogs]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Verizon Media]]\n[[Category:Video game podcasts]]\n[[Category:Video game websites]]\n[[Category:Weblogs, Inc.]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Technology blog network covering gadgets and consumer electronics}}\n{{Infobox website\n| name = Engadget\n| logo = Engadget-logo.svg\n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| url = {{URL|https://www.engadget.com/|engadget.com}}\n| commercial = Yes\n| type = [[Blog]]\n| registration = Optional\n| language = English, Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, Spanish, German\n| parent = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Weblogs, Inc.]] (2004\u20132011)\n* [[AOL|AOL Inc.]] (2011\u20132017)\n* [[Verizon Media]] (2017\u2013present)\n}}\n| editor = Dana Wollman\n| revenue = \n| owner = \n| alexa = {{decrease}} [http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/engadget.com 921 ] {{small|{{nowrap|(Global, {{as of|2020|01|28|alt=January 2019}})}}}}\n| launch_date = {{start date and age|2004|3}}\n| current_status = Online\n}}\n\n'''Engadget''' is a multilingual technology [[blog]] network with daily coverage of [[gadgets]] and [[consumer electronics]].

Eric hosted and produced 4 episodes of the podcast for Engadget until the show was taken over by Peter Rojas and Ryan Block. The podcast was hosted by Editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky along with editors Paul Miller and [[Nilay Patel]] with occasional special guests until their 2011 departure. The podcast was produced by Trent Wolbe under Topolsky's editorship and continued to be under Tim Stevens until December 2012.\n\nThe topic of discussion for the podcast is technology-related and closely linked to events that have happened during the week in the world of technology. The show generally lasts an hour or more. The show is normally weekly, however, the frequency can change, especially during special events. When events such as the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) and the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) occur, the podcast has been known to be broadcast daily.\n\nThe Engadget podcast is available as a subscription through [[iTunes]] and as an [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed. Alternatively, it can be downloaded directly from the site in either MP3, [[Ogg]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[m4b]] format. The m4b version features images related to the current topic of discussion and can be displayed in iTunes or on a compatible player.\n\nEngadget started doing live podcasts, usually broadcasting Thursday or Friday afternoons hosted by Ben Gilbert and Terrence O'Brien.

The show will be free admission and will later be put onto the site. It features one-on-one interviews, roundtable discussions, short video segments, and live music. At first it was taped at the Tishman Auditorium at [[Parsons The New School for Design]], but after the fifth show they began taping at The Times Center, part of [[The New York Times Building]].\n\nThe show was originally hosted by Joshua Topolsky along with editors Paul Miller and [[Nilay Patel]]. After their departure from Engadget and AOL in early 2011 newly appointed editor in chief Tim Stevens became the show's host. It is directed by Michelle Stahl and is executive produced by Joshua Fruhlinger and Michael Rubens. As of 2014, the show is cancelled.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Trademarks ===\nIn early 2006, Engadget reported that they were victims of their likeness being stolen and used as a store name at a mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. However, they stated they would not be taking any action.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rojas |first=Peter |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/07/10/a-visit-to-the-engadget-store/ |title=A visit to the Engadget store... |work=Engadget |date=July 10, 2006}}</ref> The store has since changed its name (or possibly shut down and a new store opened with a new name). In July 2007, another store had opened, also in Malaysia, with a logo bearing the same resemblance to Engadget's.<ref>{{cite web|last=Block |first=Ryan |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/07/01/the-fake-engadget-store-returns-in-a-new-location/ |title=The (fake) Engadget store returns in a new location! |work=Engadget |date=July 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn March 31, 2008, Engadget reported that [[Deutsche Telekom]] (the parent company of [[T-Mobile]] and [[T-Mobile USA]]) had sent a letter requesting that Engadget cease using the color magenta in its Engadget Mobile site, claiming that T-Mobile had trademarked the color.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/31/deutsche-telekom-t-mobile-demands-engadget-mobile-discontinue/|title=Deutsche Telekom / T-Mobile demands Engadget Mobile discontinue using the color magenta|work=Engadget|author=Ryan Block|date=March 31, 2008|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}</ref> Engadget issued a response on April 1, mainly by repainting the Engadget sites and changing the Mobile logo for the day to a logo that looks as though it is saying \"Engadge t-mobile\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/01/painting-the-town-magenta/|title=Painting the town magenta|work=Engadget|author=Ryan Block|date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}</ref> The site has since returned to normal format, with the exception of the highlighting color.\n\n===William Shatner and Twitter verification===\nOn June 21, 2014, actor [[William Shatner]] raised an issue with several of Engadget's editorial staff and their \"verification\" status on [[Twitter]]. This began when the site's social media editor, [[John Colucci]] tweeted a celebration of the site hitting over 1 million Twitter followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanwhite/william-shatner-went-on-a-massive-rant-about-how-hes-sick-of/|title=William Shatner Went On A Massive Rant About How He's Sick Of \"Nobodies\" Getting Verified On Twitter|work=BuzzFeed|author=Alan White|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref> Besides Colucci, Shatner also targeted several junior members of the staff for being \"nobodies\" unlike some of his actor colleagues who did not have such distinction. Shatner claimed Colucci and team were bullying him when giving a text interview to Mashable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ulanoff |first=Lance |url=http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/ |title=William Shatner: My Problem With Twitter's Verified Accounts |work=Engadget |date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> Over a month later, Shatner continued to discuss the issue on his Tumblr page,<ref>{{cite web|last=Shatner |first=William |url=http://williamshatner.tumblr.com/post/93274499035/abusing-verification-segueing-with-shatner |title=Abusing Verification - Segueing with Shatner |work=Engadget |date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> to which Engadget replied with its own response, defending its team and discussing the controversy around social media verification.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Nicole |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/31/the-perks-of-being-somebody-online/ |title=The perks of being 'somebody' online |work=Engadget |date=July 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===''The Verge''===\nIn early 2011, eight of the more prominent editorial and technology staff members left [[AOL]] to build a new gadget site with CEO [[Jim Bankoff]] at [[SB Nation]].<ref>Carr, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/business/media/04carr.html \"No Longer Shackled by AOL\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 3, 2011,</ref> On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, \"We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven't made a hire since I started running the site, and I thought we could be more successful elsewhere\".\n\nIt appears the departure of the team from AOL which includes not only Topolsky but editors [[Nilay Patel]], Paul Miller, [[Joanna Stern]], Ross Miller, Chris Ziegler, Chad Mumm, Justin Glow, Dan Chilton, Thomas Ricker and Vladislav Savov was primarily the cause of an internal memo distributed by AOL detailing \"The AOL Way\", a 58-page long company plan to grow [[AOL]] into a media empire. Some employees suggested that AOL was sacrificing journalism for page views and that it would be difficult for the organization to apply a 'one size fits all' business model to reporting. The group set up a \"placeholder site\", ''[[This Is My Next]]'', while they developed a new technology news site in partnership with [[Vox Media]]. The new site, called ''[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]'', was launched on November 1, 2011.\n\n==Awards==\nEngadget has been nominated for numerous awards, including 2004 [[Bloggies|Bloggie]] for Best Technology Weblog, and 2005 Bloggies for Best Computers or Technology Weblog and Best Group Weblog; Engadget won Best Tech Blog in the 2004 and 2005 Weblog Awards.\n\n''The Engadget Show'' won the 2011 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in Consumer Electronics,<ref>{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Nilay |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/04/engadget-wins-the-peoples-voice-webby-in-consumer-electronics/ |title=wins the People's Voice Webby in Consumer Electronics, and you can win a Droid Incredible! |work=Engadget |date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> while also winning the official Webby in Consumer Electronics (voted on by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Tim |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/04/we-won-some-webby-awards-and-now-you-can-win-a-blackberry-playb/ |title=We won some Webby Awards, and now you can win a BlackBerry PlayBook! |work=Engadget |date=May 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Engadget}}\n*{{Official website|www.engadget.com}}\n\n{{Verizon Media}}\n\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2004]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Technology blogs]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Verizon Media]]\n[[Category:Video game podcasts]]\n[[Category:Video game websites]]\n[[Category:Weblogs, Inc.]]\n", "name_user": "WeyerStudentOfAgrippa", "label": "safe", "comment": "removing inconsistent italicization", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget"}
