Commonly nicknamed the \"Piano Man\" after his first major hit and signature [[Piano Man (song)|song of the same name]], he has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having released twelve studio albums from 1971 to 1993 as well as one studio album in 2001.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006). In 2001, Joel received the [[Johnny Mercer]] Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.songhall.org/awards/winner/Billy_Joel|title=Billy Joel: Johnny Mercer Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, Joel received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

It is perhaps best known for \"[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]\", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \"The Entertainer\" as a sarcastic response: \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered{{By whom|date=February 2018}} one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \"Los Angelenos\" and \"[[Root Beer Rag]]\", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.\n\nIn late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.\n\nDisenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\"; \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\"; \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],\" a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986). ''The Stranger'' was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the ''Billboard'' charts: \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\" (No. 3), \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)|Movin' Out]]\" (No. 17), \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\" ( No. 24), and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\" (No. 17).

The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the following hits: \"[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]\" (No. 3); followed successes from the album were \"[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]\" (No. 14), and \"[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]\" (No. 24).

''52nd Street ''won Grammy awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and Album of the Year.\n\nIn 1979, Joel also traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place between March 2\u20134, alongside [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata G\u00fcines]] and [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |title=article on Havana Jam |work=People |date=March 19, 1979 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> His performance is captured in [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.\n\n===1979\u20131983: ''Glass Houses'' and ''The Nylon Curtain''===\nThe success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\", \"She's Always a Woman\", and \"Honesty\" led some critics to label Joel a \"[[ballad]]eer\" and \"[[soft rock]]er\". Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release.

At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]].

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007.

Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 4.jpg|thumb|Joel with [[Mike DelGuidice]] in 2016]]\nOn January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. Joel performed his classical piece titled, \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\".\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.\n\nJoel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006). In 2001, Joel received the [[Johnny Mercer]] Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.songhall.org/awards/winner/Billy_Joel|title=Billy Joel: Johnny Mercer Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, Joel received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

Columbia released a remastered version of ''Cold Spring Harbor ''in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.\n\nJoel began his ''Cold Spring Harbor'' tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band ([[Rhys Clark]] on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and [[Larry Russell (bassist)|Larry Russell]] on bass guitar) throughout the US and Puerto Rico, opening for groups such as [[the J.

Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican [[Mar y Sol Pop Festival]] was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album ''[[Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival (album)|Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival]]''.

Artie Ripp sold Joel's first contract to Columbia. [[Walter Yetnikoff]], the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel's songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift.<ref>''The Last Play at Shea'' (documentary film). 2010.

Despite modest sales, ''Piano Man''<nowiki/>'s title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That year Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 [[Helen Reddy]] recorded \"You're My Home\" (''Piano Man'').\n\n===1974\u20131977: ''Streetlife Serenade'' and ''Turnstiles''===\nIn 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''.

It is perhaps best known for \"[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]\", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \"The Entertainer\" as a sarcastic response: \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered{{By whom|date=February 2018}} one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \"Los Angelenos\" and \"[[Root Beer Rag]]\", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.\n\nIn late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.\n\nDisenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\", \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]]\", a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the following hits: \"[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]\" (No. 3); followed successes from the album were \"[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]\" (No. 14), and \"[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]\" (No. 24). A cover of \"My Life\" (sung by Gary Bennett) became the theme song for a new television sitcom, ''[[Bosom Buddies]]'', which featured actor [[Tom Hanks]] in one of his earliest roles. ''52nd Street ''won Grammy awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and Album of the Year.\n\nIn 1979, Joel also traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place between March 2\u20134, alongside [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata G\u00fcines]] and [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |title=article on Havana Jam |work=People |date=March 19, 1979 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> His performance is captured in [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.\n\n===1979\u20131983: ''Glass Houses'' and ''The Nylon Curtain''===\nThe success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\", \"She's Always a Woman\", and \"Honesty\" led some critics to label Joel a \"[[ballad]]eer\" and \"[[soft rock]]er\". Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release.

At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]].

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007.

He later appears as the main protagonist in the 2015 [[anime]] film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure and also being mentored by his father's best friend, [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]].'' In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the ''Boruto'' film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates\u2014[[Sarada Uchiha]] and [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]]\u2014as well as his teacher, [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]].\n\nDespite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by [[Kokoro Kikuchi]] in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and by [[Y\u016bko Sanpei]] in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by [[Amanda C. Miller]].\n\nBoruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the ''Naruto'' manga. In ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto created Boruto in 2013 when the manga ''[[Naruto]]'' was at its climax. The motivation for the creation was him wanting [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to become a father when the manga ends.<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |title=\u300cBoruto -Naruto The Movie-\u300d\u5267\u573a\u7248\u4e0a\u6620\u524d\u7279\u522b\u8282\u76ee |date=August 5, 2015 |publisher=AC Fun |access-date=June 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701041528/http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |archivedate=July 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the finale of ''Naruto'', Boruto makes a prank in the mountain of Konoha that shows all its leaders, the Hokages.

In the making of the ''Boruto'' film, Yamashita said some scenes regarding to Boruto were removed due to time constraints such as one of the character's interactions with his father as well as another interaction between Boruto and Sarada. A difficult scene for the staff was the use of Boruto's {{nihongo|Rasengan|\u87ba\u65cb\u4e38||lit. spiral sphere, English manga: \"Spiral Chakra Sphere\"}} technique which had to disappear shortly after being used and then appearing again in an attack.

Additionally, he gave him a simpler costume than Naruto's original one that would yet remain the symbol of the Uzumaki clan.

He later appears as the main protagonist in the 2015 [[anime]] film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure and also being mentored by his father's best friend, [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]].'' In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the ''Boruto'' film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates\u2014[[Sarada Uchiha]] and [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]]\u2014as well as his teacher, [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]].\n\nDespite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by [[Kokoro Kikuchi]] in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and by [[Y\u016bko Sanpei]] in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by [[Amanda C. Miller]].\n\nBoruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the ''Naruto'' manga. In ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto created Boruto in 2013 when the manga ''[[Naruto]]'' was at its climax. The motivation for the creation was him wanting [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to become a father when the manga ends.<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |title=\u300cBoruto -Naruto The Movie-\u300d\u5267\u573a\u7248\u4e0a\u6620\u524d\u7279\u522b\u8282\u76ee |date=August 5, 2015 |publisher=AC Fun |access-date=June 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701041528/http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |archivedate=July 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the finale of ''Naruto'', Boruto makes a prank in the mountain of Konoha that shows all its leaders, the Hokages.

Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single [[character (computing)|character]] of text in a computer<ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Bemer_1959\"/> and for this reason it is the smallest [[address space|addressable]] unit of [[Computer memory|memory]] in many [[computer architecture]]s.\n\nThe size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. Sizes from 1 to 48 bits have been used.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\"/><ref name=\"CDC_1965_3600\"/><ref name=\"Rao_1989\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/> The [[six-bit character code]] was an often used implementation in early encoding systems and computers using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common in the 1960s. These systems often had [[Word (computer architecture)|memory words]] of 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 bits, corresponding to 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 six-bit bytes. In this era, bit groupings in the instruction stream were often referred to as ''[[Syllable (computing)|syllables]]'', before the term ''byte'' became common.\n\nThe modern [[de facto standard]] of eight bits, as documented in ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993, is a convenient [[power of two]] permitting the [[binary number|binary-encoded]] values 0 through 255 for one byte\u20142 to the power 8 is 256.<ref name=\"ISO_IEC_2382-1_1993\"/> The international standard [[IEC 80000-13]] codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the eight-bit size.<ref name=\"CHM_1964\"/> Modern architectures typically use 32- or 64-bit words, built of four or eight bytes.\n\nThe unit symbol for the byte was designated as the upper-case letter ''B'' by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE)<ref name=\"MIXF\"/> in contrast to the bit, whose IEEE symbol is a lower-case ''b''. Internationally, the unit ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'', symbol ''o'', explicitly defines a sequence of eight bits, eliminating the ambiguity of the byte.<ref name=\"TCPIP\"/><ref name=\"ISO_2382-4\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe term ''byte'' was coined by [[Werner Buchholz]] in June 1956,<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Timeline_1956\"/>{{efn|{{anchor|Note-Dates}}Many sources erroneously indicate a birthday of the term ''byte'' in July 1956, but [[Werner Buchholz]] claimed that the term would have been coined in [[#Buchholz-1977|June 1956]]. In fact, the [[#Buchholz-1956-1|earliest document]] supporting this dates from 1956-06-11. Buchholz stated that the transition to 8-bit bytes was conceived in [[#Buchholz-1977|August 1956]], but the earliest document found using this notion dates from [[#Buchholz-1956-3|September 1956]].}} during the early design phase for the [[IBM 7030|IBM Stretch]]<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_2\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_3\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Timeline_1956\"/><ref name=\"ESR\"/><ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/> computer, which had addressing to the bit and variable field length (VFL) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/>\nIt is a deliberate respelling of ''[[bite]]'' to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Blaauw_1959\"/>\n\nAnother origin of ''byte'' for bit groups smaller than a computers's word size, and in particular groups of [[Nibble (computing)|four bits]], is on record by Louis G. Dooley, who claimed he coined the term while working with [[Jules Schwartz]] and Dick Beeler on an air defense system called [[Experimental SAGE Subsector|SAGE]] at [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] in 1956 or 1957, which was jointly developed by [[Rand Corporation|Rand]], MIT, and IBM.<ref name=\"Dooley_1995_Byte\"/><ref name=\"Ram_Byte\"/> Later on, Schwartz's language [[JOVIAL]] actually used the term, but the author recalled vaguely that it was derived from [[AN/FSQ-31]].<ref name=\"Schwartz_Brooks_ACM\"/><ref name=\"Ram_Byte\"/>\n\nEarly computers used a variety of four-bit [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) representations and the [[Sixbit|six-bit]] codes for printable graphic patterns common in the [[U.S. Army]] ([[FIELDATA]]) and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII) as the [[Federal Information Processing Standard]], which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of [[control character]]s to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media.<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/> During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of [[System/360]] the eight-bit [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (EBCDIC), an expansion of their [[six-bit binary-coded decimal]] (BCDIC) representations{{efn|There was more than one BCD code page.}} used in earlier card punches.<ref name=\"ibmebcdic\"/>\nThe prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size,<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_3\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/> while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[AT&T]] introduced [[digital telephony]] on long-distance [[trunk line]]s. These used the eight-bit [[\u03bc-law algorithm|\u03bc-law encoding]]. This large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for eight-bit data.\n\nThe development of [[eight-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s in the 1970s popularized this storage size. Microprocessors such as the [[Intel 8008]], the direct predecessor of the [[Intel 8080|8080]] and the [[Intel 8086|8086]], used in early personal computers, could also perform a small number of operations on the [[4bit|four-bit]] pairs in a byte, such as the decimal-add-adjust (DAA) instruction. A four-bit quantity is often called a [[nibble]], also ''nybble'', which is conveniently represented by a single [[hexadecimal]] digit.\n\nThe term ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'' is used to unambiguously specify a size of eight bits.<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/><ref name=\"ISO_2382-4\"/> It is used extensively in [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] definitions.\n\nHistorically, the term ''octad'' or ''octade'' was used to denote eight bits as well at least in Western Europe;<ref name=\"Williams_1969\"/><ref name=\"Philips_1971\"/> however, this usage is no longer common. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it can be found in British, Dutch, and German sources of the 1960s and 1970s, and throughout the documentation of [[Philips]] mainframe computers.\n\n==Unit symbol==\n{{Bit and byte prefixes}}\nThe unit symbol for the byte is specified in [[IEC 80000-13]], [[IEEE 1541]] and the Metric Interchange Format<ref name=\"MIXF\"/> as the upper-case character ''B''. In contrast, IEEE 1541 specifies the lower case character ''b'' as the symbol for the [[bit]], but IEC 80000-13 and Metric-Interchange-Format specify the symbol as ''bit'', providing disambiguation from B for byte.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ), B is the symbol of the ''[[bel (acoustics)|bel]]'', a unit of logarithmic power ratios named after [[Alexander Graham Bell]], creating a conflict with the IEC specification. However, little danger of confusion exists, because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the [[decibel]] (dB), for [[signal strength]] and [[sound pressure level]] measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, the decibyte, and other fractions, are only used in derived units, such as transmission rates.\n\nThe lowercase letter o for [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is defined as the symbol for octet in IEC 80000-13 and is commonly used in languages such as [[French language|French]]<ref name=\"IEC_Binary\"/> and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and is also combined with metric prefixes for multiples, for example ko and Mo.\n\nThe usage of the term ''octad(e)'' for eight bits is no longer common.<ref name=\"Williams_1969\"/><ref name=\"Philips_1971\"/>\n\n==Unit multiples==\n[[File:Binaryvdecimal.svg|thumb|right|275px|Percentage difference between decimal and binary interpretations of the unit prefixes grows with increasing storage size]]\n\nDespite standardization efforts, ambiguity still exists in the meanings of the [[SI prefix|SI (or metric) prefixes]] used with the unit byte, especially concerning the prefixes ''kilo'' (k or K), ''mega'' (M), and ''giga'' (G). Computer memory has a binary architecture in which multiples are expressed in [[power of two|powers of 2]]. In some fields of the software and computer hardware industries a [[binary prefix]] is used for bytes and bits, while producers of computer storage devices practice adherence to decimal SI multiples. For example, a computer disk drive capacity of 100&nbsp;gigabytes is specified when the disk contains 100&nbsp;billion bytes (93&nbsp;gibibytes) of storage space.\n\nWhile the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is relatively small for the prefixes [[Kilo-|kilo]] and [[Mega-|mega]], it grows to over 20% for prefix [[yotta]]. The linear\u2013log graph illustrates the difference versus storage size up to an [[exa]]byte.\n\n==Common uses==\nMany [[programming language]]s defined the [[data type]] ''byte''.\n\nThe [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages define ''byte'' as an \"''addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment''\" (clause 3.6 of the C standard). The C standard requires that the integral data type ''[[signedness|unsigned]] char'' must hold at least 256 different values, and is represented by at least eight bits (clause 5.2.4.2.1). Various implementations of C and C++ reserve 8, 9, 16, 32, or 36 bits for the storage of a byte.<ref name=\"Cline_Bytes\"/><ref name=\"Klein_2008\"/>{{efn|The actual number of bits in a particular implementation is documented as <code>CHAR_BIT</code> as implemented in the file [[limits.h]].}} In addition, the C and C++ standards require that there are no gaps between two bytes. This means every bit in memory is part of a byte.<ref name=\"Cline_FAQ\"/>\n\n[[Java (programming language)|Java's]] primitive <code>byte</code> data type is always defined as consisting of 8 bits and being a signed data type, holding values from \u2212128 to 127.\n\n.NET programming languages, such as C#, define both an unsigned <code>byte</code> and a signed <code>sbyte</code>, holding values from 0 to 255, and [[two's complement|\u2212128 to 127]], respectively.\n\nIn data transmission systems, the byte is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits in a serial data stream representing the smallest distinguished unit of data. A transmission unit might include start bits, stop bits, or [[parity bit]]s, and thus could vary from 7 to 12 bits to contain a single 7-bit [[ASCII]] code.<ref name=\"NWU\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Data]]\n* [[Data hierarchy]]\n* [[JBOB]], Just a Bunch Of Bytes\n* [[Nibble]]\n* [[Primitive data type]]\n* [[Tryte]]\n* [[Qubyte]] (quantum byte)\n* [[Word (computer architecture)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\">{{anchor|Buchholz-1956-1}}{{cite book |title=The Link System |chapter=7.

The 60 bits are dumped into [[magnetic core]]s on six different levels. Thus, if a 1 comes out of position 9, it appears in all six cores underneath.

The 0-diagonal is pulsed first, sending out the six bits 0 to 5, of which the Adder accepts only the first four (0\u20133). Bits 4 and 5 are ignored. Next, the 4 diagonal is pulsed.

His letter tells the story.''<br />Not being a regular reader of your magazine, I heard about the question in the November 1976 issue regarding the origin of the term \"byte\" from a colleague who knew that I had prepetrated this piece of jargon ''[see page 77 of November 1976 BYTE, \"Olde Englishe\"]''. I searched my files and could not locate a birth certificate. But I am sure that \"byte\" is coming of age in 1977 with its 21st birthday. Many have assumed that byte, meaning 8 bits, originated with the IBM System/360, which spread such bytes far and wide in the mid-1960s. The editor is correct in pointing out that the term goes back to the earlier Stretch computer (but incorrect in that Stretch was the first, not the last, of IBM's second-generation transistorized computers to be developed). -->[\u2026] The first reference found in the files was contained in an internal memo written in June 1956 during the early days of developing [[IBM Stretch|Stretch]]. A byte was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input-output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8 bit bytes was considered in [[#Note-Dates|August 1956]] and incorporated in the design of Stretch [[#Buchholz-1956-3|shortly thereafter]]. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper '[[#Blaauw-1959|Processing Data in Bits and Pieces]]' by [[Gerrit Anne Blaauw|G&nbsp;A&nbsp;Blaauw]], [[Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.|F&nbsp;P&nbsp;Brooks&nbsp;Jr]] and [[Werner Buchholz|W&nbsp;Buchholz]] in the ''[[IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers]]'', June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of ''[[#Buchholz-1962|Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch)]]'', edited by W&nbsp;Buchholz, [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows:<br />Byte ''denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input-output units. A term other than ''character'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)''<br />[[System/360]] took over many of the Stretch concepts, including the basic byte and word sizes, which are powers of 2. For economy, however, the byte size was fixed at the 8 bit maximum, and addressing at the bit level was replaced by byte addressing. [\u2026]<!-- Since then the term byte has generally meant 8 bits, and it has thus passed into the general vocabulary. Are there any other terms coined especially for the computer field which have found their way into general dictionaries of English language?<br />W.

Thus Buchholz's 'byte' caught on everywhere. I myself did not like the name for many reasons. The design had 8 bits moving around in parallel. But then came a new IBM part, with 9 bits for self-checking, both inside the CPU and in the [[tape drive]]s. I exposed this 9-bit byte to the press in 1973. But long before that, when I headed software operations for [[Cie. Bull]] in France in 1965\u201366, I insisted that 'byte' be deprecated in favor of '[[octet (computing)|octet]]'. [\u2026]<!-- You can notice that my preference then is now the preferred term. --> It is justified by new communications methods that can carry 16, 32, 64, and even 128 bits in parallel. But some foolish people now refer to a '16-bit byte' because of this parallel transfer, which is visible in the [[UNICODE]] set. I'm not sure, but maybe this should be called a '[[hextet]]'.

In that era, computer memory structure was already defined in terms of [[word size (computing)|word size]]. A word consisted of x number of [[bit]]s; a bit represented a binary notational position in a word. Operations typically operated on all the bits in the full word.<br />We coined the word byte to refer to a logical set of bits less than a full word size. At that time, it was not defined specifically as x bits but typically referred to as a set of [[Nibble (computing)|4 bits]], as that was the size of most of our coded data items. Shortly afterward, I went on to other responsibilities that removed me from SAGE. After having spent many years in Asia, I returned to the U.S. and was bemused to find out that the word byte was being used in the new microcomputer technology to refer to the basic addressable memory unit.}} (NB. According to his son, Dooley wrote to him:<!-- See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Byte#Not_.22to_bite.22_but_.22a_bite.22 --> \"On good days, we would have the [[IBM XD-1|XD-1]] up and running and all the programs doing the right thing, and we then had some time to just sit and talk idly, as we waited for the computer to finish doing its thing.

The origin of the word was a need for referencing only a part of the word length of the computer, but a part larger than just one bit...Many programs had to access just a specific [[Nibble (computing)|4-bit]] segment of the full word...I wanted a name for this smaller segment of the fuller word.

Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single [[character (computing)|character]] of text in a computer<ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Bemer_1959\"/> and for this reason it is the smallest [[address space|addressable]] unit of [[Computer memory|memory]] in many [[computer architecture]]s.\n\nThe size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. Sizes from 1 to 48 bits have been used.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\"/><ref name=\"CDC_1965_3600\"/><ref name=\"Rao_1989\"/><ref name=\"Tafel_1971\"/> The [[six-bit character code]] was an often used implementation in early encoding systems and computers using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common in the 1960s. These systems often had [[Word (computer architecture)|memory words]] of 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 bits, corresponding to 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 six-bit bytes. In this era, bit groupings in the instruction stream were often referred to as ''[[Syllable (computing)|syllables]]'', before the term ''byte'' became common.\n\nThe modern [[de facto standard]] of eight bits, as documented in ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993, is a convenient [[power of two]] permitting the [[binary number|binary-encoded]] values 0 through 255 for one byte\u20142 to the power 8 is 256.<ref name=\"ISO_IEC_2382-1_1993\"/> The international standard [[IEC 80000-13]] codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the eight-bit size.<ref name=\"CHM_1964\"/> Modern architectures typically use 32- or 64-bit words, built of four or eight bytes.\n\nThe unit symbol for the byte was designated as the upper-case letter ''B'' by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE)<ref name=\"MIXF\"/> in contrast to the bit, whose IEEE symbol is a lower-case ''b''. Internationally, the unit ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'', symbol ''o'', explicitly defines a sequence of eight bits, eliminating the ambiguity of the byte.<ref name=\"TCPIP\"/><ref name=\"ISO_2382-4\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe term ''byte'' was coined by [[Werner Buchholz]] in June 1956,<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Timeline_1956\"/>{{efn|{{anchor|Note-Dates}}Many sources erroneously indicate a birthday of the term ''byte'' in July 1956, but [[Werner Buchholz]] claimed that the term would have been coined in [[#Buchholz-1977|June 1956]]. In fact, the [[#Buchholz-1956-1|earliest document]] supporting this dates from 1956-06-11. Buchholz stated that the transition to 8-bit bytes was conceived in [[#Buchholz-1977|August 1956]], but the earliest document found using this notion dates from [[#Buchholz-1956-3|September 1956]].}} during the early design phase for the [[IBM 7030|IBM Stretch]]<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_2\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_3\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Timeline_1956\"/><ref name=\"ESR\"/><ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/> computer, which had addressing to the bit and variable field length (VFL) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/>\nIt is a deliberate respelling of ''[[bite]]'' to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.<ref name=\"Buchholz_1962\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/><ref name=\"Blaauw_1959\"/>\n\nAnother origin of ''byte'' for bit groups smaller than a computers's word size, and in particular groups of [[Nibble (computing)|four bits]], is on record by Louis G. Dooley, who claimed he coined the term while working with [[Jules Schwartz]] and Dick Beeler on an air defense system called [[Experimental SAGE Subsector|SAGE]] at [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] in 1956 or 1957, which was jointly developed by [[Rand Corporation|Rand]], MIT, and IBM.<ref name=\"Dooley_1995_Byte\"/><ref name=\"Ram_Byte\"/> Later on, Schwartz's language [[JOVIAL]] actually used the term, but the author recalled vaguely that it was derived from [[AN/FSQ-31]].<ref name=\"Schwartz_Brooks_ACM\"/><ref name=\"Ram_Byte\"/>\n\nEarly computers used a variety of four-bit [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) representations and the [[Sixbit|six-bit]] codes for printable graphic patterns common in the [[U.S. Army]] ([[FIELDATA]]) and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII) as the [[Federal Information Processing Standard]], which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of [[control character]]s to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media.<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/> During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of [[System/360]] the eight-bit [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (EBCDIC), an expansion of their [[six-bit binary-coded decimal]] (BCDIC) representations{{efn|There was more than one BCD code page.}} used in earlier card punches.<ref name=\"ibmebcdic\"/>\nThe prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size,<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_3\"/><ref name=\"Buchholz_1977\"/> while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[AT&T]] introduced [[digital telephony]] on long-distance [[trunk line]]s. These used the eight-bit [[\u03bc-law algorithm|\u03bc-law encoding]]. This large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for eight-bit data.\n\nThe development of [[eight-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s in the 1970s popularized this storage size. Microprocessors such as the [[Intel 8008]], the direct predecessor of the [[Intel 8080|8080]] and the [[Intel 8086|8086]], used in early personal computers, could also perform a small number of operations on the [[4bit|four-bit]] pairs in a byte, such as the decimal-add-adjust (DAA) instruction. A four-bit quantity is often called a [[nibble]], also ''nybble'', which is conveniently represented by a single [[hexadecimal]] digit.\n\nThe term ''[[Octet (computing)|octet]]'' is used to unambiguously specify a size of eight bits.<ref name=\"Bemer_2000\"/><ref name=\"ISO_2382-4\"/> It is used extensively in [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] definitions.\n\nHistorically, the term ''octad'' or ''octade'' was used to denote eight bits as well at least in Western Europe;<ref name=\"Williams_1969\"/><ref name=\"Philips_1971\"/> however, this usage is no longer common. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it can be found in British, Dutch, and German sources of the 1960s and 1970s, and throughout the documentation of [[Philips]] mainframe computers.\n\n==Unit symbol==\n{{Bit and byte prefixes}}\nThe unit symbol for the byte is specified in [[IEC 80000-13]], [[IEEE 1541]] and the Metric Interchange Format<ref name=\"MIXF\"/> as the upper-case character ''B''. In contrast, IEEE 1541 specifies the lower case character ''b'' as the symbol for the [[bit]], but IEC 80000-13 and Metric-Interchange-Format specify the symbol as ''bit'', providing disambiguation from B for byte.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ), B is the symbol of the ''[[bel (acoustics)|bel]]'', a unit of logarithmic power ratios named after [[Alexander Graham Bell]], creating a conflict with the IEC specification. However, little danger of confusion exists, because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the [[decibel]] (dB), for [[signal strength]] and [[sound pressure level]] measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, the decibyte, and other fractions, are only used in derived units, such as transmission rates.\n\nThe lowercase letter o for [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is defined as the symbol for octet in IEC 80000-13 and is commonly used in languages such as [[French language|French]]<ref name=\"IEC_Binary\"/> and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and is also combined with metric prefixes for multiples, for example ko and Mo.\n\nThe usage of the term ''octad(e)'' for eight bits is no longer common.<ref name=\"Williams_1969\"/><ref name=\"Philips_1971\"/>\n\n==Unit multiples==\n[[File:Binaryvdecimal.svg|thumb|right|275px|Percentage difference between decimal and binary interpretations of the unit prefixes grows with increasing storage size]]\n\nDespite standardization efforts, ambiguity still exists in the meanings of the [[SI prefix|SI (or metric) prefixes]] used with the unit byte, especially concerning the prefixes ''kilo'' (k or K), ''mega'' (M), and ''giga'' (G). Computer memory has a binary architecture in which multiples are expressed in [[power of two|powers of 2]]. In some fields of the software and computer hardware industries a [[binary prefix]] is used for bytes and bits, while producers of computer storage devices practice adherence to decimal SI multiples. For example, a computer disk drive capacity of 100&nbsp;gigabytes is specified when the disk contains 100&nbsp;billion bytes (93&nbsp;gibibytes) of storage space.\n\nWhile the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is relatively small for the prefixes [[Kilo-|kilo]] and [[Mega-|mega]], it grows to over 20% for prefix [[yotta]]. The linear\u2013log graph illustrates the difference versus storage size up to an [[exa]]byte.\n\n==Common uses==\nMany [[programming language]]s defined the [[data type]] ''byte''.\n\nThe [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages define ''byte'' as an \"''addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment''\" (clause 3.6 of the C standard). The C standard requires that the integral data type ''[[signedness|unsigned]] char'' must hold at least 256 different values, and is represented by at least eight bits (clause 5.2.4.2.1). Various implementations of C and C++ reserve 8, 9, 16, 32, or 36 bits for the storage of a byte.<ref name=\"Cline_Bytes\"/><ref name=\"Klein_2008\"/>{{efn|The actual number of bits in a particular implementation is documented as <code>CHAR_BIT</code> as implemented in the file [[limits.h]].}} In addition, the C and C++ standards require that there are no gaps between two bytes. This means every bit in memory is part of a byte.<ref name=\"Cline_FAQ\"/>\n\n[[Java (programming language)|Java's]] primitive <code>byte</code> data type is always defined as consisting of 8 bits and being a signed data type, holding values from \u2212128 to 127.\n\n.NET programming languages, such as C#, define both an unsigned <code>byte</code> and a signed <code>sbyte</code>, holding values from 0 to 255, and [[two's complement|\u2212128 to 127]], respectively.\n\nIn data transmission systems, the byte is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits in a serial data stream representing the smallest distinguished unit of data. A transmission unit might include start bits, stop bits, or [[parity bit]]s, and thus could vary from 7 to 12 bits to contain a single 7-bit [[ASCII]] code.<ref name=\"NWU\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Data]]\n* [[Data hierarchy]]\n* [[JBOB]], Just a Bunch Of Bytes\n* [[Nibble]]\n* [[Primitive data type]]\n* [[Tryte]]\n* [[Qubyte]] (quantum byte)\n* [[Word (computer architecture)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Buchholz_1956_1\">{{anchor|Buchholz-1956-1}}{{cite book |title=The Link System |chapter=7.

The 60 bits are dumped into [[magnetic core]]s on six different levels. Thus, if a 1 comes out of position 9, it appears in all six cores underneath. Pulsing any diagonal line will send the six bits stored along that line to the Adder. The Adder may accept all or only some of the bits.<br />Assume that it is desired to operate on 4 bit [[decimal digit]]s, starting at the right. The 0-diagonal is pulsed first, sending out the six bits 0 to 5, of which the Adder accepts only the first four (0\u20133). Bits 4 and 5 are ignored. Next, the 4 diagonal is pulsed. This sends out bits 4 to 9, of which the last two are again ignored, and so on.<br />It is just as easy to use all six bits in [[alphanumeric]] work, or to handle bytes of only one bit for logical analysis, or to offset the bytes by any number of bits. All this can be done by pulling the appropriate shift diagonals. An analogous matrix arrangement is used to change from serial to parallel operation at the output of the adder.

His letter tells the story.''<br />Not being a regular reader of your magazine, I heard about the question in the November 1976 issue regarding the origin of the term \"byte\" from a colleague who knew that I had prepetrated this piece of jargon ''[see page 77 of November 1976 BYTE, \"Olde Englishe\"]''. I searched my files and could not locate a birth certificate. But I am sure that \"byte\" is coming of age in 1977 with its 21st birthday. Many have assumed that byte, meaning 8 bits, originated with the IBM System/360, which spread such bytes far and wide in the mid-1960s. The editor is correct in pointing out that the term goes back to the earlier Stretch computer (but incorrect in that Stretch was the first, not the last, of IBM's second-generation transistorized computers to be developed). -->[\u2026] The first reference found in the files was contained in an internal memo written in June 1956 during the early days of developing [[IBM Stretch|Stretch]]. A byte was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input-output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8 bit bytes was considered in [[#Note-Dates|August 1956]] and incorporated in the design of Stretch [[#Buchholz-1956-3|shortly thereafter]]. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper '[[#Blaauw-1959|Processing Data in Bits and Pieces]]' by [[Gerrit Anne Blaauw|G&nbsp;A&nbsp;Blaauw]], [[Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.|F&nbsp;P&nbsp;Brooks&nbsp;Jr]] and [[Werner Buchholz|W&nbsp;Buchholz]] in the ''[[IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers]]'', June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of ''[[#Buchholz-1962|Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch)]]'', edited by W&nbsp;Buchholz, [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows:<br />Byte ''denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input-output units. A term other than ''character'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)''<br />[[System/360]] took over many of the Stretch concepts, including the basic byte and word sizes, which are powers of 2. For economy, however, the byte size was fixed at the 8 bit maximum, and addressing at the bit level was replaced by byte addressing. [\u2026]<!-- Since then the term byte has generally meant 8 bits, and it has thus passed into the general vocabulary. Are there any other terms coined especially for the computer field which have found their way into general dictionaries of English language?<br />W.

[\u2026]<!-- Add 26 lower case letters to 47 existing, and one got 73 -- 9 more than 6 bits could represent. --> I even made a proposal (in view of [[IBM Stretch|STRETCH]], the very first computer I know of with an 8-bit byte) that would extend the number of [[punch card]] character codes to 256 [\u2026].<!-- [1]. Some folks took it seriously. I thought of it as a spoof. --> So some folks started thinking about 7-bit characters, but this was ridiculous. With IBM's STRETCH computer as background, handling 64-character words divisible into groups of 8 (I designed the character set for it, under the guidance of Dr. [[Werner Buchholz]], the man who DID coin the term 'byte' for an 8-bit grouping). [\u2026]<!-- [2] --> It seemed reasonable to make a universal 8-bit character set, handling up to 256. In those days my mantra was 'powers of 2 are magic'. And so the group I headed developed and justified such a proposal [\u2026]<!-- [3]. That was a little too much progress when presented to the standards group that was to formalize ASCII, so they stopped short for the moment with a 7-bit set, or else an 8-bit set with the upper half left for future work. --> The [[IBM System 360|IBM 360]] used 8-bit characters, although not ASCII directly. Thus Buchholz's 'byte' caught on everywhere. I myself did not like the name for many reasons. The design had 8 bits moving around in parallel. But then came a new IBM part, with 9 bits for self-checking, both inside the CPU and in the [[tape drive]]s. I exposed this 9-bit byte to the press in 1973. But long before that, when I headed software operations for [[Cie. Bull]] in France in 1965\u201366, I insisted that 'byte' be deprecated in favor of '[[octet (computing)|octet]]'. [\u2026]<!-- You can notice that my preference then is now the preferred term. --> It is justified by new communications methods that can carry 16, 32, 64, and even 128 bits in parallel. But some foolish people now refer to a '16-bit byte' because of this parallel transfer, which is visible in the [[UNICODE]] set. I'm not sure, but maybe this should be called a '[[hextet]]'.

In that era, computer memory structure was already defined in terms of [[word size (computing)|word size]]. A word consisted of x number of [[bit]]s; a bit represented a binary notational position in a word. Operations typically operated on all the bits in the full word.<br />We coined the word byte to refer to a logical set of bits less than a full word size. At that time, it was not defined specifically as x bits but typically referred to as a set of [[Nibble (computing)|4 bits]], as that was the size of most of our coded data items. Shortly afterward, I went on to other responsibilities that removed me from SAGE. After having spent many years in Asia, I returned to the U.S. and was bemused to find out that the word byte was being used in the new microcomputer technology to refer to the basic addressable memory unit.}} (NB.

On one such occasion, I coined the word \"byte\", they ([[Jules Schwartz]] and Dick Beeler) liked it, and we began using it amongst ourselves. The origin of the word was a need for referencing only a part of the word length of the computer, but a part larger than just one bit...Many programs had to access just a specific [[Nibble (computing)|4-bit]] segment of the full word...I wanted a name for this smaller segment of the fuller word. The word \"[[bit]]\" lead to \"[[bite]]\" (meaningfully less than the whole), but for a unique spelling, \"i\" could be \"y\", and thus the word \"byte\" was born.\")</ref>\n<ref name=\"Schwartz_Brooks_ACM\">{{citation |title=Origin of the term \"byte\", 1956 |url=http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0646.html |access-date=2017-04-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410125522/http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0646.html |archive-date=2017-04-10 |quote=A question-and-answer session at an [[ACM conference]] on the history of programming languages included this exchange:<br />[[John Goodenough|JOHN GOODENOUGH]]: You mentioned that the term \"byte\" is used in [[JOVIAL]].
