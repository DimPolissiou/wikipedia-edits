It is the closest relative of ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'', the wild silk moth. The '''silkworm''' is the [[larva]] or [[caterpillar]] of a silk moth. It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of [[silk]]. A silkworm's preferred food is [[white mulberry]] leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even [[Osage orange]]. Domestic silk moths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are thus not as commercially viable in the production of silk.\n\n[[Sericulture]], the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China,<ref>{{cite book |title=Prehistoric Textiles: the Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean |author=E.

The major groups of silkworms fall under the univoltine (\"uni-\"=one, \"voltine\"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories. The univoltine type is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe. The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually. The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]]. The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles. The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only be found in the tropics. The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trevisan|first=Adrian|title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture|url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|publisher=Sense of Nature|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10746 An adult silkworm moth.jpg|thumb|left|Adult silk moth]]\n[[File:Silkmoth.jpg|thumb|left|Wild silk moth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'']]\n\nEggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a preference for [[Morus alba|white mulberry]], having an attraction to the mulberry odorant [[Jasmone|cis-jasmone]]. They are not [[monophagous]], since they can eat other species of ''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]'', as well as some other [[Moraceae]], mostly [[Osage orange]]. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to [[Ecdysis|molt]]. After molting, the [[larva]]l phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.\n\nAfter they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow, and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the [[pupa]]l phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the [[salivary glands]]. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other [[Lepidoptera]] produce cocoons, but only a few\u2014the [[Bombycidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Bombyx]]'', and the [[Saturniidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Antheraea]]''\u2014have been exploited for fabric production.\n\nIf the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it releases [[proteolytic enzyme]]s to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which seriously reduces the value of the silk [[Yarn|threads]], but not silk cocoons used as \"stuffing\" available in China and elsewhere for doonas, jackets, etc. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled. The heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm itself is eaten.\n\nAs the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larva, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was critical of silk production based on the [[Ahimsa]] philosophy \"not to hurt any living thing\". This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute. He also promoted [[Ahimsa silk]], [[wild silk]] made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silk moths.<ref>\"Mahatma Gandhi: 100 years\", 1968, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVuAAAAMAAJ p. 349]</ref>\n\nThe moth \u2013 the adult phase of the lifecycle \u2013 is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild ''B. mandarina'' and other ''Bombyx'' species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. However, some silk moths can still fly.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjK6k70xNA8</ref> Silk moths have a wingspan of {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored. Adult [[Bombycidae]] have reduced mouthparts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.\n\n== Cocoon ==\n[[File:Cocoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cocoon of ''B. mori'']]\n\nThe cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000&nbsp;ft) long. The fibers are very fine and luscious, about 10 \u03bcm (0.0004&nbsp;in) in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make 1 pound of silk (0.4&nbsp;kg). At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/603/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=603#ancor|title=faostat.fao.org}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:Micrographia Schem 25 fig 2.jpg|thumb|A study of an egg of a silkworm from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n[[File:Maria_Sibylla_Merian_Maulbeerbaum_samt_Frucht_plate_1.png|thumb|right|1679 study of the silkworm metamorphosis by [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], it depicts the fruit and leaves of a [[mulberry]] tree and the eggs and larvae of the silkworm moth.]]\n\nDue to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a [[model organism]] in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology.

She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.\n\nThe Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, \"hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry\", probably in the first half of the first century AD.<ref>Sarah Underhill Wisseman, Wendell S. Williams. ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials ''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|2-88124-632-X}}. Page 131.</ref> About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms, in a hollow stick, out of China and sold the secret to the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nAccording to a Vietnamese folk tale, silkworms were originally a beautiful housemaid running away from her gruesome masters and living in the mountain, where she was protected by the mountain god. One day, a lecherous god from the heaven came down to Earth to seduce women. When he saw her, he tried to rape her but she was able to escape and hidden by the mountain god. The lecherous god then tried to find and capture her by setting a net trap around the mountain. With the blessing of [[Guanyin]], the girl was able to safely swallow that net into her stomach. Finally, the evil god summons his fellow thunder and rain gods to attack and burn away her clothes, forcing her to hide in a cave. Naked and cold, she spitted out the net and used it as a blanket to sleep. The girl died in her sleep, and as she wished to continue to help other people, her soul turned into silkworms.\n\n== Silkworm diseases ==\n*''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body. This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity. This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage. This fungus, however, can spread to other insects.\n*[[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|Grasserie]], also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the ''Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus''<!--ICTV MSL 2018b.v2--> (aka ''Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus'', genus ''[[Alphabaculovirus]]''). If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing. Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching. Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house. This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.\n*[[P\u00e9brine]] is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, ''[[Nosema (microsporidian)|Nosema bombycis]]''. Diseased larvae show slow growth, undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death. ''N. bombycis'' kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs. This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then to eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food that the silkworms eat. Female moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of silkworms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.\n*[[Flacherie]] infected silkworms look weak and are colored dark brown before they die. The disease destroys the larva's gut and is caused by viruses or poisonous food.\n*Several diseases caused by a variety of funguses are collectively named [[Muscardine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cocoonase]]\n* [[History of silk]]\n* [[Silk Road]]\n* [[List of animals that produce silk]]\n* ''[[Samia cynthia]]''\n* [[Thai silk]]\n* [[Lao silk]]\n* [[Japanese silk]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4waAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1 |title=The culture of the mulberry silkworm |first1=Henrietta Aiken |last1=Kelly |place=Washington DC |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |year=1903 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |last2=Engel |first1=David A. |first2=Michael S. |authorlink1=David A.

It is the closest relative of ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'', the wild silk moth. The '''silkworm''' is the [[larva]] or [[caterpillar]] of a silk moth. It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of [[silk]]. A silkworm's preferred food is [[white mulberry]] leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even [[Osage orange]]. Domestic silk moths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are thus not as commercially viable in the production of silk.\n\n[[Sericulture]], the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China,<ref>{{cite book |title=Prehistoric Textiles: the Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean |author=E.

The major groups of silkworms fall under the univoltine (\"uni-\"=one, \"voltine\"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories. The univoltine type is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe. The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually. The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]]. The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles. The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only be found in the tropics. The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trevisan|first=Adrian|title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture|url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|publisher=Sense of Nature|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10746 An adult silkworm moth.jpg|thumb|left|Adult silk moth]]\n[[File:Silkmoth.jpg|thumb|left|Wild silk moth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'']]\n\nEggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a preference for [[Morus alba|white mulberry]], having an attraction to the mulberry odorant [[Jasmone|cis-jasmone]]. They are not [[monophagous]], since they can eat other species of ''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]'', as well as some other [[Moraceae]], mostly [[Osage orange]]. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to [[Ecdysis|molt]]. After molting, the [[larva]]l phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.\n\nAfter they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow, and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the [[pupa]]l phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the [[salivary glands]]. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other [[Lepidoptera]] produce cocoons, but only a few\u2014the [[Bombycidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Bombyx]]'', and the [[Saturniidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Antheraea]]''\u2014have been exploited for fabric production.\n\nIf the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it releases [[proteolytic enzyme]]s to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which seriously reduces the value of the silk [[Yarn|threads]], but not silk cocoons used as \"stuffing\" available in China and elsewhere for doonas, jackets, etc. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled. The heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm itself is eaten.\n\nAs the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larva, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was critical of silk production based on the [[Ahimsa]] philosophy \"not to hurt any living thing\". This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute. He also promoted [[Ahimsa silk]], [[wild silk]] made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silk moths.<ref>\"Mahatma Gandhi: 100 years\", 1968, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVuAAAAMAAJ p. 349]</ref>\n\nThe moth \u2013 the adult phase of the lifecycle \u2013 is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild ''B. mandarina'' and other ''Bombyx'' species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. However, some silk moths can still fly.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjK6k70xNA8</ref> Silk moths have a wingspan of {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored. Adult [[Bombycidae]] have reduced mouthparts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.\n\n== Cocoon ==\n[[File:Cocoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cocoon of ''B. mori'']]\n\nThe cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000&nbsp;ft) long. The fibers are very fine and luscious, about 10 \u03bcm (0.0004&nbsp;in) in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make 1 pound of silk (0.4&nbsp;kg). At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/603/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=603#ancor|title=faostat.fao.org}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:Micrographia Schem 25 fig 2.jpg|thumb|A study of an egg of a silkworm from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n[[File:Maria_Sibylla_Merian_Maulbeerbaum_samt_Frucht_plate_1.png|thumb|right|1679 study of the silkworm metamorphosis by [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], it depicts the fruit and leaves of a [[mulberry]] tree and the eggs and larvae of the silkworm moth.]]\n\nDue to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a [[model organism]] in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology.

The domestic silk moths cannot fly, so the males need human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments have also been lost, so the domestic silk moths are leucistic, since camouflage is not useful when they only live in captivity.

In Israel, this is done in kindergarten as well. -->\n\nThe domestic silk moth has been raised as a hobby in countries such as China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Iran. Children often pass on the eggs, creating a non-commercial population. The experience provides children with the opportunity to witness the life cycle of silk moths.

She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.\n\nThe Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, \"hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry\", probably in the first half of the first century AD.<ref>Sarah Underhill Wisseman, Wendell S. Williams. ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials ''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|2-88124-632-X}}. Page 131.</ref>About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms, in a hollow stick, out of China and sold the secret to the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nAccording to a Vietnamese folk tale, silkworms were originally a beautiful housemaid running away from her gruesome masters and living in the mountain, where she was protected by the mountain god. One day, a lecherous god from the heaven came down to Earth to seduce women. When he saw her, he tried to rape her but she was able to escape and hidden by the mountain god. The lecherous god then tried to find and capture her by setting a net trap around the mountain. With the blessing of [[Guanyin]], the girl was able to safely swallow that net into her stomach. Finally, the evil god summons his fellow thunder and rain gods to attack and burn away her clothes, forcing her to hide in a cave. Naked and cold, she spitted out the net and used it as a blanket to sleep. The girl died in her sleep, and as she wished to continue to help other people, her soul turned into silkworms.\n\n== Silkworm diseases ==\n*''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body. This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity. This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage. This fungus, however, can spread to other insects.\n*[[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|Grasserie]], also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the ''Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus''<!--ICTV MSL 2018b.v2--> (aka ''Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus'', genus ''[[Alphabaculovirus]]''). If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing. Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching. Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house. This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.\n*[[P\u00e9brine]] is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, ''[[Nosema (microsporidian)|Nosema bombycis]]''. Diseased larvae show slow growth, undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death. ''N. bombycis'' kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs. This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then to eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food that the silkworms eat. Female moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of silkworms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.\n*[[Flacherie]] infected silkworms look weak and are colored dark brown before they die. The disease destroys the larva's gut and is caused by viruses or poisonous food.\n*Several diseases caused by a variety of funguses are collectively named [[Muscardine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cocoonase]]\n* [[History of silk]]\n* [[Silk Road]]\n* [[List of animals that produce silk]]\n* ''[[Samia cynthia]]''\n* [[Thai silk]]\n* [[Lao silk]]\n* [[Japanese silk]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4waAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1 |title=The culture of the mulberry silkworm |first1=Henrietta Aiken |last1=Kelly |place=Washington DC |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |year=1903 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |last2=Engel |first1=David A. |first2=Michael S. |authorlink1=David A.

[[Rajesh Khanna]], who has a double role in the film was nominated for a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] in 1982 for his performance in this film.\n\n\n==Plot==\nDeepak ([[Rajesh Khanna]]) is accused of killing a courtesan, Munnibai and a trial take place in court. His lover Seema ([[Hema Malini]]) appears against him as public prosecutor and gets him life imprisonment. Seema remembers her days with Deepak three years ago, when both were ardent lovers and how she loved him. Both consider themselves as married and united by their souls. Deepak wants to meet Seema and she unwillingly meets him in jail. Deepak explains to her how fate brought him into jail.\n\nDeepak is a lawyer and looks for good opportunities in his career. He has a sister Sushma ([[Poornima Jayaram]]), the only family he has left in this world. Seema introduces Deepak to her father, who dislikes their relationship, but pretends to accept them. Seema's father urges her to pursue her law career in America, but she refuses as she does not want to leave Deepak for three years. Deepak persuades her to go ahead and Seema obeys him, hoping to get married after three years. After Seema has left, Seema's father shows Deepak his real face and orders Deepak to go away from Seema and Deepak does not accept. Deepak's sister Sushma has got engaged with a man named Ajit and Deepak arranges for their marriage. Ajit initially behaves well, understanding Deepak's financial position, but turns evil when Seema's father tempts him with money to ask for dowry during their marriage and Ajit does so. Unable to get as much money as Ajit asked for, Deepak goes to Seema's father for help. Seema's father agrees to help him on the condition that he should marry another girl and leave Seema forever. Unwillingly, Deepak accepts for his sister's sake and marries another woman. But his wife dies in a year after giving birth to their son Vicky. Left alone with his child, Deepak's misfortune chases him when Ajit kills a courtesan Munnibai. Deepak takes the blame on himself and lands in jail. Seema understands her father's role behind everything and wants to make an appeal on the verdict, but Deepak stops her. He requests her to take care of his child Vicky and accept him as her son, to which Seema promises.\n\nSeema becomes mother of Vicky and raises him and Deepak spends his life in jail. As years passed, Vicky ([[Rajesh Khanna]]) returns from America after completing his studies and Deepak gets released from prison.

[[Rajesh Khanna]], who has a double role in the film was nominated for a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] in 1982 for his performance in this film.\n\n\n==Plot==\nDeepak ([[Rajesh Khanna]]) is accused of killing a courtesan, Munnibai and a trial take place in court. His lover Seema ([[Hema Malini]]) appears against him as public prosecutor and gets him life imprisonment. Seema remembers her days with Deepak three years ago, when both were ardent lovers and how she loved him. Both consider themselves as married and united by their souls. Deepak wants to meet Seema and she unwillingly meets him in jail. Deepak explains to her how fate brought him into jail.\n\nDeepak is a lawyer and looks for good opportunities in his career. He has a sister Sushma ([[Poornima Jayaram]]), the only family he has left in this world. Seema introduces Deepak to her father, who dislikes their relationship, but pretends to accept them. Seema's father urges her to pursue her law career in America, but she refuses as she does not want to leave Deepak for three years. Deepak persuades her to go ahead and Seema obeys him, hoping to get married after three years. After Seema has left, Seema's father shows Deepak his real face and orders Deepak to go away from Seema and Deepak does not accept. Deepak's sister Sushma has got engaged with a man named Ajit and Deepak arranges for their marriage. Ajit initially behaves well, understanding Deepak's financial position, but turns evil when Seema's father tempts him with money to ask for dowry during their marriage and Ajit does so. Unable to get as much money as Ajit asked for, Deepak goes to Seema's father for help. Seema's father agrees to help him on the condition that he should get married to another girl and go away from Seema forever. Unwillingly, Deepak accepts for his sister's sake and marries another woman. But his wife dies in a year after giving birth to their son Vicky. Left alone with his child, Deepak's misfortune chases him when Ajit kills a courtesan Munnibai. Deepak takes the blame on himself and lands in jail. Seema understands her father's role behind everything and wants to make an appeal on the verdict, but Deepak stops her. He requests her to take care of his child Vicky and accept him as her son, to which Seema promises.\n\nSeema becomes mother of Vicky and raises him and Deepak spends his life in jail. As years passed, Vicky ([[Rajesh Khanna]]) returns from America after completing his studies and Deepak gets released from prison. He does not want Vicky to know that he is his father as he is very unlucky man and his misfortunes should not affect his son. Vicky brings his lover Poonam ([[Poonam Dhillon]]) and introduces her to his mother. Deepak gets a job of gardener in Poonam's house and Vicky becomes a successful lawyer, replacing his mother Seema as public prosecutor. Deepak feels happy on seeing his son whenever he visits Poonam's home. Poonam and Vicky get engaged and everything goes smooth until the arrival of Ajit, who is now an evil drunkard. Ajit blackmails Seema that he wishes to meet Vicky and tell about Deepak to him.

The name was taken from the former [[North Western Road Car Company (1923)|North Western]] operations, which ran between 1923 and 1976. In 1988 the North Western operations were sold to Drawlane who was later sold to [[British Bus]],<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02756786 Companies House extract company no 2756786] British Bus Limited formerly British Bus plc</ref> who also took over the operations of the [[North Western Road Car Company (1986)|Bee Line Buzz Company]], who ran services in [[Greater Manchester]]. In 1996, British Bus was bought by the [[Arriva|Cowie Group]]. In November 1997 Cowie was rebranded as Arriva with North Western becoming Arriva North West in 1998.\n\nIn February 2000, Arriva North West purchased [[MTL (transport company)|MTL Trust Holdings]], which created a larger presence in the [[Merseyside]] area and more than doubled the size of the company. In 2002, Arriva North West merged with [[Arriva Buses Wales]] to form [[Arriva North West & Wales]].

Other recent deliveries include 128 Alexander Dennis Enviro400s which entered service at [[Bootle]], Green Lane, Speke, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] and [[Southport]] depots in between mid 2014 and mid 2015.

Prior to this, 35 [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s entered service in 2009, mainly displacing Volvo Olympians. 23 of the Enviro400s were allocated to Birkenhead for services through the [[Mersey Tunnels]], these being the first vehicles in the fleet to carry the \"Interurban\" livery, apart from a solitary demonstrator. The other twelve were for services between Bootle and Aigburth Vale.\n\nPreviously, 30 [[Volvo B7TL]]s with [[Alexander ALX400]] bodywork had entered service on routes between Liverpool and Garston in 2006, marking the end of a 7\u00bd year hiatus of new double-deckers. Between 2011 and 2013, the double deck fleet was updated with the arrival of 25 [[DAF DB250]]s with [[Plaxton President|Plaxton]] bodywork and seventeen Volvo B7TLs with [[Wright Eclipse Gemini|Wrightbus]] bodywork from [[Arriva London]], replacing [[Alexander ALX400|Alexander]]-bodied DAF DB250s, which were also ex-London buses. In 2017, a batch of eleven Wrightbus-bodied Volvo B5LH hybrids transferred to Arriva North West from [[Arriva Southern Counties]], with eleven VDL DB300s transferring to [[Maidstone]] in exchange.\n\n====Single deck====\n[[File:ANWScania5305.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wright Axcess-Ultralow]] bodied [[Scania L113]]CRL in September 2009]]\nThe standard single deck vehicle in the fleet is the [[VDL SB200]] with [[Wright Commander|Commander]], [[Wright Pulsar|Pulsar]] and Pulsar 2 bodywork; between them, these types now make up nearly two thirds (59%) of the single deck fleet.

Until early 2016, a batch of three Ikarus Polaris bodied DAF SB220s were operated on services in and around Bolton. These were the remaining examples out of seven that were acquired with the Blue Bus fleet, which accounted for a majority of those which were imported into the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2011, Speke depot received a total of ten [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] [[articulated bus]]es from [[Arriva London]].

The name was taken from the former [[North Western Road Car Company (1923)|North Western]] operations, which ran between 1923 and 1976.

In 1996, British Bus was bought by the [[Arriva|Cowie Group]]. In November 1997 Cowie was rebranded as Arriva with North Western becoming Arriva North West in 1998.\n\nIn February 2000, Arriva North West purchased [[MTL (transport company)|MTL Trust Holdings]], which created a larger presence in the [[Merseyside]] area and more than doubled the size of the company. In 2002, Arriva North West merged with [[Arriva Buses Wales]] to form [[Arriva North West & Wales]].

Prior to this, 35 [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s entered service in 2009, mainly displacing Volvo Olympians. 23 of the Enviro400s were allocated to Birkenhead for services through the [[Mersey Tunnels]], these being the first vehicles in the fleet to carry the \"Interurban\" livery, apart from a solitary demonstrator. The other twelve were for services between Bootle and Aigburth Vale.\n\nPreviously, 30 [[Volvo B7TL]]s with [[Alexander ALX400]] bodywork had entered service on routes between Liverpool and Garston in 2006, marking the end of a 7\u00bd year hiatus of new double-deckers. Between 2011 and 2013, the double deck fleet was updated with the arrival of 25 [[DAF DB250]]s with [[Plaxton President|Plaxton]] bodywork and seventeen Volvo B7TLs with [[Wright Eclipse Gemini|Wrightbus]] bodywork from [[Arriva London]], replacing [[Alexander ALX400|Alexander]]-bodied DAF DB250s, which were also ex-London buses.

Until early 2016, a batch of three Ikarus Polaris bodied DAF SB220s were operated on services in and around Bolton. These were the remaining examples out of seven that were acquired with the Blue Bus fleet, which accounted for a majority of those which were imported into the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2011, Speke depot received a total of ten [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] [[articulated bus]]es from [[Arriva London]].

As Sudan was administered as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]] from 1899 to 1955, [[Marching band#Military Style|British military bands]] have left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]] or even the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s. Until today, these marching bands represent a characteristic element in the parades for [[History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|Independence Day]] or other official celebrations.\n\n==The 1920s - Haqibah and the origins of modern Sudanese music==\nModern Sudanese music has its roots in [[haqibah]] style music (pronounced ''hagee-ba'' and meaning ''\"briefcase\"''). It originated in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Islamic praise of the prophet, known as [[madeeh]]. Haqibah is essentially a [[harmonic]] vocal style, with percussion coming from the [[tambourine]]-like [[riq]] and from other instruments. Occasionally, tonal instruments such as the [[piano]] and the [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]] (a stringed instrument) are used.\n\n{{Quote|text=The original Briefcase (translated from the Arabic El Haqiba), is a large and somewhat ill-defined collection of Sudanese songs from the mid 20th century, combining strong words and songs by both Sudanese and non-Sudanese poets and musicians. The name comes from the briefcase that the radio presenter Ahmed Osman used to carry the records in and from which he selected the different tracks to play on his radio show back in the 1920s.

As Sudan was administered as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]] from 1899 to 1955, [[Marching band#Military Style|British military bands]] have left their mark, especially through the musical training of Sudanese soldiers and by introducing Western [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]] or even the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s. Until today, these marching bands represent a characteristic element in the parades for [[History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|Independence Day]] or other official celebrations.\n\n==The 1920s - Haqibah and the origins of modern Sudanese music==\nModern Sudanese music has its roots in [[haqibah]] style music (pronounced ''hagee-ba'' and meaning ''\"briefcase\"''). It originated in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Islamic praise of the prophet, known as [[madeeh]]. Haqibah is essentially a [[harmonic]] vocal style, with percussion coming from the [[tambourine]]-like [[riq]] and from other instruments. Occasionally, tonal instruments such as the [[piano]] and the [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]] (a stringed instrument) are used.\n\n{{Quote|text=The original Briefcase (translated from the Arabic El Haqiba), is a large and somewhat ill-defined collection of Sudanese songs from the mid 20th century, combining strong words and songs by both Sudanese and non-Sudanese poets and musicians. The name comes from the briefcase that the radio presenter Ahmed Osman used to carry the records in and from which he selected the different tracks to play on his radio show back in the 1920s. Over time, these songs became the staple of Sudanese music, with every new genre introduction compared with and torn down against these \u2018original\u2019, \u2018authentic\u2019 songs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Briefcase: Bridging Musical Generational Gaps|accessdate=December 15, 2005|url=https://www.andariya.com/post/Briefcase-Bridging-Musical-Generational-Gaps|last= Gaafar|first=Reem |work=Andariya cultural magazine}}</ref>}}\n\n== The 1930s up to the 1950s - Rise of popular music through records, radio and music halls ==\nIn the 1930s, a number of music companies opened in Sudan, among them the [[Gordon Memorial College]] musical company, which included [[Mohamed Adam Adham]], whose ''Adhamiya'' was one of the earliest formal Sudanese compositions, and is still often played.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 15, 2005 |title=Sudanese Singing 1908-1958 |work=By: El Sirr A.

This period was marked by the introduction of tonal instruments from both East and West, such as the [[violin]], [[accordion]], [[oud]], [[tabla]] and [[bongo drum|bongo]]. A [[big band]] style came into existence, mirroring trends in the [[Western world|West]]. Post-haqibah, like haqibah, was based on the [[pentatonic]] scale.  Haqibah mixed with Egyptian and European elements is called ''al-aghani al-hadith''(modern songs).\n\nThe 1940s saw an influx of new names due to the rise of live radio shows at Radio Omdurman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.voanews.com/music-time-in-africa/2009/12/16/the-golden-era-of-omdurman-songs/|title=The Golden Era of Omdurman Songs \u00ab Music Time in Africa|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Early performers included Ismail Abdul Mennen, Hassan Atya, and Ahmed al Mustafa. Ismael Abdul Queen was a pioneer who strived to adapt to the new conditions and deserted the old style. He was followed by a singer-songwriter called Ahmed Ibrahim Falah. But both were soon overtaken by [[Ibrahim al Kashif]], who became known as the \"Father of modern singing\". Al Kashif began to sing under the influence of Haj Mohamed Ahmed Sarour and relied on what the pioneer of Sudanese singing Abdel-Karim Karouma had started, renewing these popular singing styles. For live performances, there were also two dance halls in Khartoum, St James' and the Gordon Music Hall.\n\n== The 1960s up to the 1980s - International influence of Western and African pop music ==\n\nIn the 1960s, American pop stars became well known, which had a profound effect on Sudanese musicians like Osman Alamu and Ibrahim Awad, the latter becoming the first Sudanese musician to dance onstage.<ref name=\"roughguide\" />  Under these influences, Sudanese popular music saw a further [[Westernisation]], with the introduction of [[guitar]]s and [[brass]] instruments; guitars came from the south of the country, played like the [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]lese guitar styles.

They introduced modern rhythms relating to Western pop and soul music, using for the first time electric guitars, double bass, and brass instruments, with the emphasis on the rhythm section. The lyrics were also poetic and popular. Up to the 2010s, Sharhabil's band has been one of the leading names in Sudanese music, performing both at home as well as internationally.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, female singers became socially acceptable with the rise of Mihera bint Abboud, Um el Hassan el Shaygiya and [[Aisha Musa Ahmad|Aisha al Falatiya]], who as early as 1943 was the first woman to sing on Sudanese radio.

The result was a kind of dance music, referred to as (Sudanese) ''jazz'', not related to the American style of [[jazz]], but similar to analogous modern styles throughout East Africa.

Watson advertisement, 1923]]Dr. Thomas Boswell Watson (1815\u20131860), from [[Scotland]], was the first member of the Watson family to arrive in the [[Far East]], where in 1845 he set up a private practice in [[Macau]], on the southwest coast of China.<ref name=\"RASHK\">{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/8deeba7475f950a5f3938fc24f687bbe.pdf|title=Hongs Kong's Hongs with Long Histories and British Connections|author=Dan Waters|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|year=1990|volume=30|pages=219\u2013256|issn=1991\u20137295}} p. 221</ref> After selling his practice to a fellow doctor, he moved to Hong Kong in 1856 where he became part owner of the Hong Kong Dispensary, an offshoot of the [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] Dispensary which operated from 1828 to 1858. \n\nKnown as the \"Big Medicine Shop\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u85e5\u623f}}; [[Cantonese]]: ''Dai Yeuk Fong''), the dispensary's main customers were soldiers and sailors. The dispensary was not known as A.S. Watson until 1870, although Alexander Skirving Watson took over in 1858 following management changes.<ref name=\"RASHK\"/> T. B. Watson sent his family back to Scotland in 1857, and he himself followed two years later.\n\nFollowing the death of Dr T. B. Watson in 1860, the Hong Kong Dispensary was leased to A. S. Watson and two other doctors, and onwards from 1862, the name A.S. Watson featured prominently at the Hong Kong Dispensary. In 1871, the Watson family leased the company to [[John David Humphreys|Dr John David Humphreys]] and Dr Arthur Hunt, and thereafter trading was executed under the name A.S. Watson & Company. \n\nRetail outlets were known as \"Watsons the Chemist\". The current owners, Hutchison Group, acquired a controlling interest in A.S. Watson & Co., Ltd in 1963.

Watson advertisement, 1923]]Dr. Thomas Boswell Watson (1815\u20131860), from [[Scotland]], was the first member of the Watson family to arrive in the [[Far East]], where in 1845 he set up a private practice in [[Macau]], on the southwest coast of China.<ref name=\"RASHK\">{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/8deeba7475f950a5f3938fc24f687bbe.pdf|title=Hongs Kong's Hongs with Long Histories and British Connections|author=Dan Waters|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|year=1990|volume=30|pages=219\u2013256|issn=1991\u20137295}} p. 221</ref> After selling his practice to a fellow doctor, he moved to Hong Kong in 1856 where he became part owner of the Hong Kong Dispensary, an offshoot of the [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] Dispensary which operated from 1828 to 1858. \n\nKnown as the \"Big Medicine Shop\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u85e5\u623f}}; [[Cantonese]]: ''Dai Yeuk Fong''), the dispensary's main customers were soldiers and sailors. The dispensary was not known as A.S. Watson until 1870, although Alexander Skirving Watson took over in 1858 following management changes.<ref name=\"RASHK\"/> T. B. Watson sent his family back to Scotland in 1857, and he himself followed two years later.\n\nFollowing the death of Dr T. B. Watson in 1860, the Hong Kong Dispensary was leased to A. S. Watson and two other doctors, and onwards from 1862, the name A.S. Watson featured prominently at the Hong Kong Dispensary. In 1871, the Watson family leased the company to [[John David Humphreys|Dr John David Humphreys]] and Dr Arthur Hunt, and thereafter trading was executed under the name A.S. Watson & Company. \n\nRetail outlets were known as \"Watsons the Chemist\". The current owners, Hutchison Group, acquired a controlling interest in A.S. Watson & Co., Ltd in 1963. In 1981, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. At this time, the group had 75 retail outlets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:HK Plaza Hollywood Watsons Store.jpg|Branch in [[Plaza Hollywood]], [[Diamond Hill]], [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:HK QRC Watsons Your Personal Store.JPG|Branch in [[Queen's Road Central]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Watsons Baby Store in Shatin Centre 2013.jpg|Watsons Baby Store Branch in [[Shatin Centre]], [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:BEAUTIQ by Watsons 2015.jpg|BEAUTIQ by Watsons Branch in [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Wastsons Shijie Store 20070331.jpg|Branch in [[Shilin Station]], [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Wastson-tainan.jpg|Branch in [[Tainan|Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Watson's Pharmacy, Dihua Street 20060225.jpg|Historical remains of Watsons Pharmacy in [[Dihua Street]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:WatsonsstoreinChengdu.jpg|Watsons store in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]]\nFile:Watsons i SM Aura, BGC.jpg|Branch in [[SM Aura Premier]], [[Fort Bonifacio|Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\nFile:Watsons SM City Sucat storefront.jpg|Branch in [[SM City Sucat]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Watsons shops|Watsons Personal Care Stores}}\n* [http://www.watsonsasia.com/ Customer website]\n* [http://www.aswatson.com/eng/html/index.html A.S.

[[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] and is now the [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] Under-23 lead coach.<ref

[[youth system|centre of excellence]]. After featuring regularly for the club's [[reserve team]], Morison made his first-team debut in 2002, and played a total of 28 times for the club during his three years with Northampton. He left Northampton and joined [[Conference South]] side [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] for an undisclosed fee in November 2004. Morison spent just under two years with Stortford, scoring prolifically, before joining another [[Hertfordshire]] team in the form of [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] for a \"small four-figure fee\" in August 2006.\n\nDuring the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307 season]], Morison scored a total of 34 times in 53 games,<ref name=\"season2006\u201c>{{Soccerbase season|30051|2006}}</ref> including the winner in Stevenage's 3\u20132 victory over [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in the [[FA Trophy]] final in May 2007 \u2013 the first competitive cup final to be held at the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. The following season, Morison netted 22 times in 45 matches, before scoring 30 times during the club's [[2008-09 in English football|2008\u201309 campaign]]; scoring again in Stevenage's 2\u20130 win against [[York City F.C.|York City]] in the FA Trophy final in May 2009, his last game for the club. He joined Millwall for \u00a3130,000 ahead of the [[2009-10 in English football|2009\u201310 season]], and helped the club to promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] by scoring 23 goals in 52 games. He finished as Millwall's top goalscorer [[2010\u201311 Millwall F.C. season|the following season]], before signing for [[Premier League]] side Norwich City for an undisclosed fee in June 2011. In January 2013, Morison signed for Leeds United as part of a swap deal. After just five months at Leeds, Morison rejoined Millwall on a season-long loan in June 2013.\n\nMorison earned eight [[cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national football C team|England C]] team, scoring three goals.

It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] and burial site for [[List of monarchs of England|English]] and, later, [[List of British monarchs|British]] monarchs. The building itself was a [[Benedictine monasteries|Benedictine monastic church]] until the monastery was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539.

It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] and burial site for [[List of monarchs of England|English]] and, later, [[List of British monarchs|British]] monarchs. The building itself was a [[Benedictine monasteries|Benedictine monastic church]] until the monastery was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539.
