By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to [[non-player character]]s that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThis attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the \"Wall Kick\", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.\n\n===Power-ups===\n[[File:Tanooki Mario.jpg|upright|thumb|Mario seen wearing the Tanooki Suit in [[Super Mario Bros. 3]].

By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to [[non-player character]]s that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThis attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the \"Wall Kick\", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.\n\n===Power-ups===\n[[File:Tanooki Mario.jpg|upright|thumb|Mario seen wearing the Tanooki Suit.

At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the [[Danube]] to [[Ruse, Bulgaria]], to pick up another train to [[Varna]]. They then completed their journey to [[Constantinople]]<!--Using the name Constantinople instead of Istanbul--> by [[ferry]]. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople<!--Still known as such from 1885--> via rail from Vienna to [[Belgrade]] and [[Ni\u0161]], carriage to [[Plovdiv]], and rail again to \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL ORIENT EXPRESS.jpg|thumb|WL Orient Express]]\nIn 1889, the train's eastern terminus became [[Varna]] in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], where passengers could take a ship to Constantinople. On June 1, 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris (Gare de l'Est). Istanbul, known as Constantinople until circa 1930 in English,<!--See [[:en:Names of Istanbul]]--> remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] by the [[Golden Horn]]. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the [[Bosphorus]] to [[Istanbul Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal|Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]], the terminus of the Asian lines of the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie|Ottoman Railways]].<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nThe onset of the [[First World War]] in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]] allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Trieste]]. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] contained a clause requiring [[Austria]] to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:Orient Express Buchs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Badge of the ''Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits'' on a car of the Orient Express]]\nThe 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express, which ran via [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Innsbruck]] to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and [[Athens]]. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their [[cuisine]]. [[Royal family|Royalty]], [[nobility|nobles]], [[diplomacy|diplomats]], [[businessperson|business people]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from [[Calais]] to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL GOLDEN ARROW.jpg|thumb|WL Golden Arrow]]\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German [[Mitropa]] company had run some services on the route through the [[Balkans]],<ref name=\"EngRail\">{{cite web | url = http://www.engrailhistory.info/r045.html | title = The Orient Express \u2013 Across Europe from London to Istanbul | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | work = Eng Rail History | publisher = engrailhistory.info}}</ref> but [[Yugoslav Partisans]] frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the [[Bulgaria]]n\u2013[[Turkey|Turkish]] border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to \u0130stanbul during that time. As the [[Iron Curtain]] fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but [[Warsaw Pact|the Communist nations]] increasingly replaced the ''[[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagon-Lits]]'' cars with carriages run by their own railway services.\n\n[[File:\u00c9tiquette \u00e0 bagage, (c)wagons-lits diffusion, paris.jpg|thumb|Luggage tag]]\n\nBy 1962, the Orient Express and [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to \u0130stanbul and Athens.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Wagon-Lits'' company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris\u2013Athens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris\u2013\u0130stanbul service running on May 19 of that year.<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref name=\"Christie\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to [[Bucharest]] as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest \u2014 and even eastwards from Vienna \u2014 was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant, that Paris\u2013Budapest and Vienna\u2013Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, so a journey was only possible with changing carriages \u2014 despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was canceled, the new final station has become Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared twice a week \u2014 now operated by [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]]. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris\u2013[[Vienna]], already in [[EuroNight]] quality \u2014 but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a Paris\u2013[[Strasbourg]] express. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name ''Orient Express'', until June 8, 2007.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nWith the opening of the [[LGV Est]] Paris\u2013Strasbourg high speed rail line on June 10, 2007, the ''Orient Express'' service was further cut back to Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name,<ref name=\"Christie\" /><ref name=\"Seat61\" /> but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades. \nThe remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the Strasbourg-Paris [[TGV]], but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive. In the last years through coaches between Vienna and [[Karlsruhe]] (continuing first to [[Dortmund]], then to [[Amsterdam]], and finally \u2014 partly from Budapest \u2014 to [[Frankfurt]]) were attached. The very last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on the 10th of December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.[[File:Sirkeci-station Orient Express.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\n== Route legacy ==\nThough the final service ran only from [[Strasbourg]] to [[Vienna]], it was possible to retrace the entire original Orient Express route with four trains: Paris\u2013Strasbourg, Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, Vienna\u2013[[Belgrade]], and Belgrade-[[\u0130stanbul]], each of which were operated daily. Other routes from Paris to \u0130stanbul exist even today, such as Paris\u2013[[Munich]]\u2013[[Budapest]]\u2013[[Bucharest]]\u2013\u0130stanbul, or Paris\u2013Z\u00fcrich\u2013Belgrade\u2013\u0130stanbul, all of which have comparable travel times of approximately 60 hours without delays. Train services across the border to [[Turkey]] were stopped through several years due to construction works, but they were reintroduced in June 2017, however, ending in \u0130stanbul's suburb [[Halkal\u0131 railway station|Halkal\u0131]], from where a transfer bus is provided to the city centre.\n\nThe luxurious dining car, where scenes for ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and other movies were filmed, is now in the OSE museum of [[Thessalonica|Thessalon\u00edka]]. The local authorities plan to refit the train to make it available for tourist use around [[the Balkans]] in the near future.\n\n== Privately run trains using the name ==\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\nIn 1976, the Swiss travel company ''Intraflug AG'' had first hired, then also bought, several CIWL-carriages, and operated them as Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express from Z\u00fcrich to [[\u0130stanbul]]. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient-Express was celebrated by a trip of this train from Paris to \u0130stanbul, and in 1988 it was run to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] via the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. From there it was transferred by ferry to [[Japan]], and used there for some excursions after regauging.\n\nAfter the failure of the American European Express (see below), ''Intraflug'' became bankrupt, and the carriages were taken over by the Reiseb\u00fcro Mittelthurgau. The sleeping cars and some other coaches (Pullmans, dining cars, luggage vans) were transferred to [[Russia]] and used between Moscow and the Mongolian-Chinese border. (The adjacent Chinese train was also branded for a while as China Orient Express; nowadays it's known as Shangri-La Express.) The remaining vehicles were used in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as diner trains until the company's 2003 bankruptcy. Since then the trains have been standing unused in different countries, as the new owners sort out problems with operations due to a lawsuit about the usage rights of the name Orient Express.\n\nIn 1982, the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] was established as a private venture, running restored 1920s and 1930s carriages from London to [[Venice]]. This service runs between March and November, and is firmly aimed at leisure travellers, with tickets costing over $3,120 per person from [[London]] to [[Venice]] (via [[Paris]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Innsbruck]], and [[Verona]]\u2014also, despite its name, the train is running via the [[Brenner Pass]] instead of the Simplon tunnel) including meals. Two or three times a year, [[Prague]] or [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] are also accessed, starting from Venice, and returning to Paris and London. Every September the train also goes from London and Paris to [[\u0130stanbul]] via [[Budapest]], [[Sinaia]], and [[Bucharest]]\u2014in the last three cities a sightseeing (and in the two capitals an overnight in hotel) also takes place\u2014the return trip on the same route ends up in Venice.\nWhile the above-mentioned routes are available almost every year, some seasons have also included unique destinations, among them [[Cologne]], [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Lucerne]], the [[High Tatras]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Stockholm]]. Such a journey is provided currently to [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Orient.Express.in.Poland.02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Venice-Simplon Orient Express in [[Poland]], in 2007]]\n\nThe company also offers a similarly themed luxury train in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]] called the [[Eastern and Oriental Express]], and operates other luxury overnight trains in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Peru]].\n\nThe Pullman Orient Express was established by the CIWL in 1994. This train has only Pullman and dining cars, but no sleepers. It's used for gourmet trips in France. After the legal disputes about the name it was taken over by the [[SNCF]] and operated since then as ''Pullman Orient-Express''.\n\nIn [[North America]], the [[American Orient Express]], formerly the American European Express and later GrandLuxe Express, operated several train sets in charter service between 1989 and 2008.\n\n[[File:CIWL ORIENT EXPRESS TAURUS, (c) wagons-lits diffusion.jpg|thumb|Orient Express poster]]\n\n== CIWL phototheque and historical archives ==\nThe CIWL archives contain more than 100 years of posters, photos, plans, and communication material that represents a tremendous interest for cultural, academic, or commercial projects.

Istanbul, known as Constantinople until circa 1930 in English,<!--See [[:en:Names of Istanbul]]--> remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] by the [[Golden Horn]]. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the [[Bosphorus]] to [[Istanbul Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal|Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]], the terminus of the Asian lines of the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie|Ottoman Railways]].<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nThe onset of the [[First World War]] in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]] allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Trieste]]. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] contained a clause requiring [[Austria]] to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and \u0130stanbul.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:Orient Express Buchs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Badge of the ''Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits'' on a car of the Orient Express]]\nThe 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express, which ran via [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Innsbruck]] to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and [[Athens]]. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their [[cuisine]]. [[Royal family|Royalty]], [[nobility|nobles]], [[diplomacy|diplomats]], [[businessperson|business people]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from [[Calais]] to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\n[[File:WL GOLDEN ARROW.jpg|thumb|WL Golden Arrow]]\nThe start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German [[Mitropa]] company had run some services on the route through the [[Balkans]],<ref name=\"EngRail\">{{cite web | url = http://www.engrailhistory.info/r045.html | title = The Orient Express \u2013 Across Europe from London to Istanbul | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | work = Eng Rail History | publisher = engrailhistory.info}}</ref> but [[Yugoslav Partisans]] frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.<ref name=\"Seat61\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the [[Bulgaria]]n\u2013[[Turkey|Turkish]] border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to \u0130stanbul during that time. As the [[Iron Curtain]] fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but [[Warsaw Pact|the Communist nations]] increasingly replaced the ''[[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Wagon-Lits]]'' cars with carriages run by their own railway services.\n\n[[File:\u00c9tiquette \u00e0 bagage, (c)wagons-lits diffusion, paris.jpg|thumb|Luggage tag]]\n\nBy 1962, the Orient Express and [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg]] Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to \u0130stanbul and Athens.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Wagon-Lits'' company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris\u2013Athens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris\u2013\u0130stanbul service running on May 19 of that year.<ref name=\"Independent\"/><ref name=\"Christie\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to [[Bucharest]] as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest \u2014 and even eastwards from Vienna \u2014 was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant, that Paris\u2013Budapest and Vienna\u2013Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, so a journey was only possible with changing carriages \u2014 despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was canceled, the new final station has become Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared twice a week \u2014 now operated by [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]]. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris\u2013[[Vienna]], already in [[EuroNight]] quality \u2014 but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a Paris\u2013[[Strasbourg]] express. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name ''Orient Express'', until June 8, 2007.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nWith the opening of the [[LGV Est]] Paris\u2013Strasbourg high speed rail line on June 10, 2007, the ''Orient Express'' service was further cut back to Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name,<ref name=\"Christie\" /><ref name=\"Seat61\" /> but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades. \nThe remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the Strasbourg-Paris [[TGV]], but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive. In the last years through coaches between Vienna and [[Karlsruhe]] (continuing first to [[Dortmund]], then to [[Amsterdam]], and finally \u2014 partly from Budapest \u2014 to [[Frankfurt]]) were attached. The very last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on the 10th of December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.[[File:Sirkeci-station Orient Express.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in [[\u0130stanbul]]]]\n\n== Route legacy ==\nThough the final service ran only from [[Strasbourg]] to [[Vienna]], it was possible to retrace the entire original Orient Express route with four trains: Paris\u2013Strasbourg, Strasbourg\u2013Vienna, Vienna\u2013[[Belgrade]], and Belgrade-[[\u0130stanbul]], each of which were operated daily. Other routes from Paris to \u0130stanbul exist even today, such as Paris\u2013[[Munich]]\u2013[[Budapest]]\u2013[[Bucharest]]\u2013\u0130stanbul, or Paris\u2013Z\u00fcrich\u2013Belgrade\u2013\u0130stanbul, all of which have comparable travel times of approximately 60 hours without delays. Train services across the border to [[Turkey]] were stopped through several years due to construction works, but they were reintroduced in June 2017, however, ending in \u0130stanbul's suburb [[Halkal\u0131 railway station|Halkal\u0131]], from where a transfer bus is provided to the city centre.\n\nThe luxurious dining car, where scenes for ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and other movies were filmed, is now in the OSE museum of [[Thessalonica|Thessalon\u00edka]]. The local authorities plan to refit the train to make it available for tourist use around [[the Balkans]] in the near future.\n\n== Privately run trains using the name ==\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\nIn 1976, the Swiss travel company ''Intraflug AG'' had first hired, then also bought, several CIWL-carriages, and operated them as Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express from Z\u00fcrich to [[\u0130stanbul]]. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient-Express was celebrated by a trip of this train from Paris to \u0130stanbul, and in 1988 it was run to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] via the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. From there it was transferred by ferry to [[Japan]], and used there for some excursions after regauging.\n\nAfter the failure of the American European Express (see below), ''Intraflug'' became bankrupt, and the carriages were taken over by the Reiseb\u00fcro Mittelthurgau. The sleeping cars and some other coaches (Pullmans, dining cars, luggage vans) were transferred to [[Russia]] and used between Moscow and the Mongolian-Chinese border. (The adjacent Chinese train was also branded for a while as China Orient Express; nowadays it's known as Shangri-La Express.) The remaining vehicles were used in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as diner trains until the company's 2003 bankruptcy. Since then the trains have been standing unused in different countries, as the new owners sort out problems with operations due to a lawsuit about the usage rights of the name Orient Express.\n\nIn 1982, the [[Venice-Simplon Orient Express]] was established as a private venture, running restored 1920s and 1930s carriages from London to [[Venice]]. This service runs between March and November, and is firmly aimed at leisure travellers, with tickets costing over $3,120 per person from [[London]] to [[Venice]] (via [[Paris]], [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Innsbruck]], and [[Verona]]\u2014also, despite its name, the train is running via the [[Brenner Pass]] instead of the Simplon tunnel) including meals. Two or three times a year, [[Prague]] or [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] are also accessed, starting from Venice, and returning to Paris and London. Every September the train also goes from London and Paris to [[\u0130stanbul]] via [[Budapest]], [[Sinaia]], and [[Bucharest]]\u2014in the last three cities a sightseeing (and in the two capitals an overnight in hotel) also takes place\u2014the return trip on the same route ends up in Venice.\nWhile the above-mentioned routes are available almost every year, some seasons have also included unique destinations, among them [[Cologne]], [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Lucerne]], the [[High Tatras]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Stockholm]]. Such a journey is provided currently to [[Berlin]].\n\n[[File:Orient.Express.in.Poland.02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Venice-Simplon Orient Express in [[Poland]], in 2007]]\n\nThe company also offers a similarly themed luxury train in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]] called the [[Eastern and Oriental Express]], and operates other luxury overnight trains in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Peru]].\n\nThe Pullman Orient Express was established by the CIWL in 1994. This train has only Pullman and dining cars, but no sleepers. It's used for gourmet trips in France. After the legal disputes about the name it was taken over by the [[SNCF]] and operated since then as ''Pullman Orient-Express''.\n\nIn [[North America]], the [[American Orient Express]], formerly the American European Express and later GrandLuxe Express, operated several train sets in charter service between 1989 and 2008.\n\n[[File:CIWL ORIENT EXPRESS TAURUS, (c) wagons-lits diffusion.jpg|thumb|Orient Express poster]]\n\n== CIWL phototheque and historical archives ==\nThe CIWL archives contain more than 100 years of posters, photos, plans, and communication material that represents a tremendous interest for cultural, academic, or commercial projects.

He was a well-behaved teenager who was very close to his mother. During an interview on the making of ''Hero'', he says that he sees his mother as his definition of a \"hero[ine]\" for having brought up two children alone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Television career==\nAfter quitting his studies, Leung worked in a variety of jobs, first as a grocer's runner at his uncle's shop, then a showroom salesman in a Hong Kong shopping centre. Around the age of 16 he met future actor and comedian [[Stephen Chow]] who influenced his decision to become an actor and remains a good friend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonyleung.info/tony/?p=169|title=The Melancholic Charm of Tony Leung Chiu Wai|publisher=[[yesasia.com]]|date=16 January 2007|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he passed the training courses of television channel [[TVB]]. Due to his boyish looks, TVB cast him as host of a children's programme, ''[[430 Space Shuttle]]''. Leung enjoyed comedies during his television years; it was for these he became well known. So, in the 1980s, he was named as one of \"TVB's [[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tigers]]\" (their five up-and-coming male TV stars) along with [[Andy Lau]], [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]] and [[Kent Tong]]. Leung starred in the highly successful ''Police Cadet'' TV serial in 1984 (later named ''Police Cadet 84'' to distinguish it from subsequent sequels).\n\nHe played an outgoing young man who decides to become a police officer; [[Maggie Cheung]], who also started her career at the same time, played a shy bookworm, Leung's upstairs neighbour and love interest. Since then they have worked together on ''[[The Yang's Saga]]'' (1985), ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1991), ''[[The Eagle Shooting Heroes]]'' (1993), ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' (1994), ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), ''Hero'' (2002), and ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2005).\n\nInterviewed by Wong Kar Wai, Leung said that he considered Maggie to be his alter ego. \"Maggie is a truly formidable partner \u2013 one to waltz with. We do not spend a lot of time with each other, as we like to keep some mystery between us. Whenever I see her, I discover something new about her\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Wong Kar Wai |title=Tony Leung: the unforgettable cowboy leading man of Asian cinema shows his true grit to a legendary director and fellow frontiersman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_35/ai_n14931780 |website=BNet |accessdate=1 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625080452/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_35/ai_n14931780 |archivedate=2008-06-25 |url-status=dead|format=Interview |date=May 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Tony Leung Chiu Wai Hands.jpg|right|thumb|Leung's hand print and autograph at the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]] in Hong Kong.]]\nMany consider Leung's role in director [[John Woo]]'s 1992 [[Hong Kong action cinema|action film]] ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' in which he co-starred with [[Chow Yun-fat]], as his breakthrough role.

Wong Kar-wai said, \"Originally, there were plans for ''Days of Being Wild'' I and II, and the sequence featuring Leung was meant to be the opening scene of the second movie. But two things happened, one of which was that ''Days of Being Wild'' didn't do well in Hong Kong, so the producers said, \"No Part 2.\" The other reason was Carina Lau's kidnapping.<ref name=\"nopart2\"/>\n\nOn 21 July 2008, the couple got married in [[Bhutan]] in royal fashion.

He is considered one of Asia's most successful and internationally recognised actors and was named as \"Small Tiger\"  among [[Five Tiger Generals of TVB]]. He has won many international acting prizes, including the [[Cannes Film Festival]] award for Best Actor for his performance in Wong Kar-wai's film ''[[In the Mood for Love]]''. Leung is widely considered the best native Hong Kong actor of his generation. He was named by [[CNN]] as one of \"Asia's 25 Greatest Actors of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Asia's 25 greatest actors of all time|url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/none/asias-25-greatest-actors-all-time-223697/|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nLeung is known for his collaborations with director [[Wong Kar-wai]], with whom he has worked in seven films including ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994), ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' (1997), ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), and ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]'' (2013).  He also appeared in three [[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]]-winning films, including ''[[A City of Sadness]]'' (1989), ''[[Cyclo (film)|Cyclo]]'' (1995) and ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007), directed by [[Ang Lee]]. Leung also stars in the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', and the box office hits ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' (1992) and ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (2002). Leung was cast as the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and will appear in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).\n\nFor ''In the Mood for Love'', Leung earned the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. He is also a seven-time winner at the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] and three-time winner at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]], holding the record for most awards in the Best Actor category. The 2002 book ''East Asian Film Stars'' describes Leung as \"undoubtedly one of the most successful and widely-acclaimed Hong Kong actors of his generation, with a broad and diverse filmography.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Daniel|editor=Leung, Wing-fai |editor2=Willis, Andy|title=East Asian Film Stars|date=2014|chapter=Body of Action, Face of Authenticity: Symbolic Stars in the Transnational Marketing and Reception of East Asian Cinema|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1137029188|page=21}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLeung was born in Hong Kong. Leung's early childhood was punctuated with parents' quarrels and arguments about money. A mischievous boy in his early years, Leung's personality changed when his father, a chronic [[gambler]], left the family when he was eight; he and his younger sister were brought up by their mother.<ref name=\"Born To Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/20/content_283096.htm |title=HK Mr Charming Tony Leung born to be an actor |date=20 November 2003 |work=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Times\">{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article2678331.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Why Tony Leung is in the mood for lust | first=Damon | last=Wise | date=18 October 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeung was a reticent, quiet child.<ref name=\"nopart2\">{{cite news|first=Karen |last=Durbin| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/movies/07durb.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Still in the Mood for a Collaboration |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=7 August 2005}}</ref> He has said that his childhood experiences paved the way for his acting career, which allows him to openly express his feelings:\n\n{{Cquote|<blockquote>\"You don't know what happened, just one day your pop disappears. And from that day on I try not to communicate with anyone. I'm so afraid to talk to my classmates, afraid that if someone says something about family I won't know what to do. So I became very isolated. So that's why I love acting, because I can express all my feelings the way I couldn't for so long.\" \"I'm a quiet person. And then when I went to TV it all came out; I cried and I wasn't ashamed. The audience thinks it's the character's feelings, but really it's my feelings, all coming out in a rush.\"<ref name=\"Born To Act\" /></blockquote>}}\n\nLeung went to private school, but he quit at the age of 15 due to financial difficulties. He was a well-behaved teenager who was very close to his mother. During an interview on the making of ''Hero'', he says that he sees his mother as his definition of a \"hero[ine]\" for having brought up two children alone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Television career==\nAfter quitting his studies, Leung worked in a variety of jobs, first as a grocer's runner at his uncle's shop, then a showroom salesman in a Hong Kong shopping centre. Around the age of 16 he met future actor and comedian [[Stephen Chow]] who influenced his decision to become an actor and remains a good friend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonyleung.info/tony/?p=169|title=The Melancholic Charm of Tony Leung Chiu Wai|publisher=[[yesasia.com]]|date=16 January 2007|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he passed the training courses of television channel [[TVB]]. Due to his boyish looks, TVB cast him as host of a children's programme, ''[[430 Space Shuttle]]''. Leung enjoyed comedies during his television years; it was for these he became well known. So, in the 1980s, he was named as one of \"TVB's [[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tigers]]\" (their five up-and-coming male TV stars) along with [[Andy Lau]], [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]] and [[Kent Tong]]. Leung starred in the highly successful ''Police Cadet'' TV serial in 1984 (later named ''Police Cadet 84'' to distinguish it from subsequent sequels).\n\nHe played an outgoing young man who decides to become a police officer; [[Maggie Cheung]], who also started her career at the same time, played a shy bookworm, Leung's upstairs neighbour and love interest. Since then they have worked together on ''[[The Yang's Saga]]'' (1985), ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1991), ''[[The Eagle Shooting Heroes]]'' (1993), ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' (1994), ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), ''Hero'' (2002), and ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2005).\n\nInterviewed by Wong Kar Wai, Leung said that he considered Maggie to be his alter ego. \"Maggie is a truly formidable partner \u2013 one to waltz with. We do not spend a lot of time with each other, as we like to keep some mystery between us. Whenever I see her, I discover something new about her\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Wong Kar Wai |title=Tony Leung: the unforgettable cowboy leading man of Asian cinema shows his true grit to a legendary director and fellow frontiersman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_35/ai_n14931780 |website=BNet |accessdate=1 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625080452/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_8_35/ai_n14931780 |archivedate=2008-06-25 |url-status=dead|format=Interview |date=May 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Tony Leung Chiu Wai Hands.jpg|right|thumb|Leung's hand print and autograph at the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]] in Hong Kong.]]\nMany consider Leung's role in director [[John Woo]]'s 1992 [[Hong Kong action cinema|action film]] ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' in which he co-starred with [[Chow Yun-fat]], as his breakthrough role.

They had known each other since ''The Replica'' in 1984, and worked on-screen together in ''Replica'' (1984), ''Duke of Mount Deer'' (1984), ''Police Cadet'' (1984, 1985, 1988),  ''The Yangs' Saga'' (1985), ''Days of Being Wild'' (1991), ''He ain't heavy, he's my father'' (1993), ''Ashes of Time'' (1994), and ''2046'' (2005).\n\nIn 1990, during the filming of ''Days of Being Wild'', Lau was abducted for several hours. Wong Kar-wai said, \"Originally, there were plans for ''Days of Being Wild'' I and II, and the sequence featuring Leung was meant to be the opening scene of the second movie. But two things happened, one of which was that ''Days of Being Wild'' didn't do well in Hong Kong, so the producers said, \"No Part 2.\" The other reason was Carina Lau's kidnapping.<ref name=\"nopart2\"/>\n\nOn 21 July 2008, the couple got married in [[Bhutan]] in royal fashion. The wedding created a media frenzy in Hong Kong, with companies spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue the wedding party.<ref>International Herald Tribune. \"[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/20/technology/hkmedia.php IHT].\" '' Actors' wedding leads to Hong Kong media frenzy.''

Its contemporary modern culture consists of a combination of [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] and [[Europe]]an cultures, mainly by [[Malay Archipelago|Malay]], [[South Asia]]n, [[East Asia]]n, and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] influences.

It was a vassal state of various empires before being reestablished and renamed by [[Sang Nila Utama]]. The island was ruled by various sultanates until 1819, when the British came to the island and set up a port and colony. During British rule, the port of Singapore flourished and attracted many migrants. After [[Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965|independence in 1965]], Singapore made its own way. The British ruled Singapore from 1945 to 1964.\n\nIt has a diverse populace of over 5.47 million people<ref>{{cite web|title=SingStat|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/browse-by-theme/population-and-population-structure|access-date=2015-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901152332/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/browse-by-theme/population-and-population-structure|archive-date=2015-09-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> which is made up of Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Eurasians (plus other mixed groups) and Asians of different origins, such as the [[Peranakan]] people, descendants of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants with Malay or Indonesian heritage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturally.co/blog/who-are-peranakans-and-what-are-their-traditions|title=Who Are The Peranakans and What Are Their Traditions?|date=2017-12-26|website=culturally.co}}</ref>\n\n==Attitudes and beliefs==\n\n=== Meritocracy ===\n\"The system of [[meritocracy]] in Singapore ensures that the best and brightest, regardless of race, religion and socio-economic background, are encouraged to develop to their fullest potential.

[[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] (NAFA) and [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] are the two main arts institutions offering full-time programmes for the performing arts in Singapore.\n\n==Languages==\n{{Further information|Languages of Singapore|Singapore English|Singlish}}\n\nMany Singaporeans are [[bilingual]]. Most speak [[Singapore Standard English|Singaporean English]] and another language, most commonly [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Singapore Colloquial English]] (Singlish). Singapore Standard English is virtually the same as [[British English|British]], Malaysian, and [[Indian English|Indian Standard English]] in most aspects of grammar and spelling, though there are some differences vocabulary and minor spelling differences; for example, the word 'swap' is commonly spelled 'swop', as is standard in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore, Indonesia on track to implement automatic tax data swop|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/business/more-business-stories/story/singapore-indonesia-track-implement-automatic-tax-data-swo|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll Singaporeans study English as their first language in schools, under the compulsory local education system, and their mother-tongue language as their second language. Thus, most Singaporeans are effectively bilingual, especially the youths in today's society. There are four main languages in usage in Singapore. The 'national' language of Singapore is [[Bahasa Melayu]]. This is in recognition of the Malay people as the indigenous community in Singapore. 85% of Singaporeans do not speak Malay. Malay is used in the national anthem, national motto and military parade drill commands. Tamil is an official language as a majority of South Asians in Singapore are ethnic Tamils from India and Sri Lanka. While most Chinese Singaporeans are descendants of southern Chinese migrants who spoke a variety of regional languages, it is the northern Chinese language of Mandarin that is official in Singapore, though dialects such as Hokkien and Cantonese are still prevalent in the older generation of Chinese.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main article|Music of Singapore}}\n{{see also|Censorship in Singapore}}\nSingapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from rock and pop to folk and classical.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main article|Media of Singapore}}\n{{see also|Cinema of Singapore|Censorship in Singapore}}\n\n==Parks==\n[[File:Supertree Grove, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore - 20120712-02.jpg|thumb|200px|The Supertree Grove at [[Gardens by the Bay]]]]\n{{Main article|List of parks in Singapore}}\n{{See also|Gardens by the Bay|Singapore Botanic Gardens}}\nGardens and gardening have a special place in Singaporean culture as well as in politics.

It was also a pre-missionary school. Trustees included two signers of the Declaration of Independence, as well as bankers, merchants, and reverends. The faculty was composed of notable figures like Noah Webster Jr. of Webster Dictionaries. Its first campus was located on the east side of Fourth Street and was directed by Rev.

Some saw it as a flight from the diversity and cosmopolitan society of Philadelphia. Despite considerable efforts to maintain diversity on campus, the school remains predominantly white, protestant Christian, and very wealthy. Ties to Philadelphia have mostly been lost.

It operates on an 8-day, rotating block schedule designed by a committee of faculty and administrators.  The basic structure of this schedule, which is designed to allow students to take six or seven academic courses, has been in place since 1998. There are two semesters, with each semester representing one-half of a credit (a one-credit long course will meet during both semesters). For the past 5 years, the Upper School did a J-Term immediately following winter break where the students would participate in one course for two weeks straight. This year, 2019, the students are doing a May-Term instead. \n\nGraduation requirements are as follows:\n4 Credits (4 years) of English; 3 Credits of Math (including Algebra 2 and Geometry); 3 Credits of Laboratory Science; 3 Credits of History (including U.S. History); 2 Credits of the same modern or classical Language (French, Spanish, Mandarin, Ancient Greek, and Latin); 1 Credit of Religion, 1 Credit of Arts (music, theater, and visual arts). New for the 2019-2020 school year is a 1/2 credit (1 semester) of Computer Science.\n\n===Athletics===\nThe Episcopal Academy is a member of the Inter-Ac league.\n\nFor boys the Inter-Ac league includes the [[The Haverford School|Haverford School]], [[Malvern Preparatory School]], [[Chestnut Hill Academy]], [[William Penn Charter School|Penn Charter]], and [[Germantown Academy]]. For girls this league includes [[William Penn Charter School|Penn Charter]], [[Germantown Academy]], [[Academy of Notre Dame de Namur (Villanova, Pennsylvania)|Notre Dame Academy]], the [[Baldwin School]], the [[Agnes Irwin School]], and [[Springside School]].\n\nThe sports requirement requires all students to participate in athletics during each of the three seasons.  Freshman and sophomores are required to participate in at least two inter-scholastic sports with the option of participating in the \"Fitness\" option for one season. Juniors may elect to participate in the \"Fitness\" option for two seasons. \"Fitness\" consists of organized athletic activities three days a week and community service two days a week. There is also a theatre offering (both on the stage and in technical theatre) in the spring (a musical) and the fall. This counts as a \"Fitness\" option as well. Seniors are permitted to take a \"Senior Cut\", that is they do not have to participate in any athletics for one season so long as they never received an \"unsatisfactory\" effort grade in any sport during their four years in the upper school.\n\nAs a co-founder of the oldest High School sport's league in America, the \"[[Inter-Academic League]],\" and in the second oldest school rivalry in the nation, (against [[the Haverford School]], later adding [[Agnes Irwin School]]) Episcopal Academy athletic teams have gained a national reputation. The boys basketball team, coached by Daniel Dougherty, gained national attention in 2005 and 2006, with full team effort including players Gerald Henderson '06 and Wayne Ellington '06.  Both were nationally ranked high school basketball players.  Henderson signed to play for [[Duke University]] while Ellington signed to play for the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].\n\nSports offered in the fall include cross country, soccer, water polo, and crew for both boys and girls. Football is offered just for boys, and tennis and field hockey are offered just for girls.\n\nSports offered in the winter include basketball, squash, swimming and diving, and winter track for both boys and girls.  Ice hockey and wrestling are offered just for boys.  A coed team is fielded in ultimate frisbee.\n\nSpring sports include crew, golf, lacrosse, and track for both boys and girls.  Baseball and tennis are offered just for boys. Softball is offered just for girls.\n\nIntramural sports such as [[paddle tennis]] and bike polo are also offered.\n\n====Events====\n\n=====A Centennial athletic tradition=====\nThe Episcopal Academy carries a tradition of inter-league competition, notably through Haverford-Irwin's Weekend.  Formerly known as Haverford Day, this tradition of competition with the Haverford School of Haverford, Pennsylvania, was established when EA was still an all-boys school, but in 2006 the rivalry and day of events was extended to include girls' athletic competition against the Agnes Irwin School of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\nEvery November, the three Inter-Academic rivals meet to compete against each other in cross country, football, soccer, field hockey, girls' tennis, and water polo. The venue alternates each year between the schools.  The weekend is preceded by \"Spirit Week,\" marked by various activities intended to energize the students for the weekend of competition and spectatorship.  Spirit Week concludes with an Upper School Pep Rally on Friday.\nOn Friday, Episcopal and Agnes Irwin (female competitors) compete in cross country, soccer, field hockey, and tennis. On Saturday, Episcopal and Haverford compete in soccer, cross country, waterpolo and [[List of high school football rivalries (100 years+)|one of the oldest football rivalries in the nation]]. The girls compete for the \"banner\" and the boys compete for the \"sweater\" which is presented to the school which wins 3 of the 4 competitive events. In the event of a tie the schools split ownership of the banner or the sweater for the year.\n\n===Religion and service===\n[[File:Episcopal Acad Chapel ext.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Episcopal Academy Chapel, designed by alumnus [[Robert Venturi]]]]\n\n====The chapel program====\nUpper School students meet once every other day for a morning chapel service in the Class of 1944 Chapel.  Middle School Chapel also meets once every other day for a morning chapel service in Christ Chapel.  Lower School Chapel meets once a week.  The Chapel service typically gives students a thirty-minute break during the school day and consists of student musical offering (violin, piano or an organ-prelude), hymns, prayers, and an address by the chaplain, a member of the faculty, a student, or a guest. An elected student vestry plans most aspects of the chapel program.  The students casually exit the chapel in single-file as a postlude carries through the campus.\n\n====Community service====\nThe Academy also runs an extensive community service program, and organizes weekly visits to a soup kitchen in Philadelphia as well as monthly visits to a nursing home and to a facility for adults with AIDS.  The Academy also participates in a tutoring program where students help younger children with their homework after school.  In addition, the Community Service office sponsors other special events throughout the year, including a clothing drive, a toy drive, and a blood drive.\n===Facilities===\n\n\n====Buildings====\n\n{{Prose|section|date=April 2019}}\n*Academic Center, with the Middle School, Upper School, and Science Center.\n*Lower School Building\n*Crawford Campus Center, including the Annenberg Library\n*Theater with Stadium Seating\n*Chapel, at the Center of Campus\n*Athletic Center, with a competition gymnasium and pool\n*Stadium Football Field\n*Black Box Theatre\n*Head of School's House\n*Chaplain's House\n\n==Notable alumni, faculty, and others==\n{{main|List of Episcopal Academy people}}\n\nAcademy Founder [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] wanted EA to be a place to produce \"leaders of society.\"  Episcopal also has a tradition of distinguished faculty.\n\nAlumni have won [[Academy Awards]], [[Emmy Awards]], [[Pulitzer Prizes]], [[Pritzker Prizes]] and one a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighthood]].

It operates on an 8-day, rotating block schedule designed by a committee of faculty and administrators.  The basic structure of this schedule, which is designed to allow students to take six or seven academic courses, has been in place since 1998. There are two semesters, with each semester representing one-half of a credit (a one-credit long course will meet during both semesters). For the past 5 years, the Upper School did a J-Term immediately following winter break where the students would participate in one course for two weeks straight. This year, 2019, the students are doing a May-Term instead. \n\nGraduation requirements are as follows:\n4 Credits (4 years) of English; 3 Credits of Math (including Algebra 2 and Geometry); 3 Credits of Laboratory Science; 3 Credits of History (including U.S. History); 2 Credits of the same modern or classical Language (French, Spanish, Mandarin, Ancient Greek, and Latin); 1 Credit of Religion, 1 Credit of Arts (music, theater, and visual arts). New for the 2019-2020 school year is a 1/2 credit (1 semester) of Computer Science.\n\n===Athletics===\nThe Episcopal Academy is a member of the Inter-Ac league.\n\nFor boys the Inter-Ac league includes the [[The Haverford School|Haverford School]], [[Malvern Preparatory School]], [[Chestnut Hill Academy]], [[William Penn Charter School|Penn Charter]], and [[Germantown Academy]]. For girls this league includes [[William Penn Charter School|Penn Charter]], [[Germantown Academy]], [[Academy of Notre Dame de Namur (Villanova, Pennsylvania)|Notre Dame Academy]], the [[Baldwin School]], the [[Agnes Irwin School]], and [[Springside School]].\n\nThe sports requirement requires all students to participate in athletics during each of the three seasons.  Freshman and sophomores are required to participate in at least two inter-scholastic sports with the option of participating in the \"Fitness\" option for one season. Juniors may elect to participate in the \"Fitness\" option for two seasons. \"Fitness\" consists of organized athletic activities three days a week and community service two days a week. There is also a theatre offering (both on the stage and in technical theatre) in the spring (a musical) and the fall. This counts as a \"Fitness\" option as well. Seniors are permitted to take a \"Senior Cut\", that is they do not have to participate in any athletics for one season so long as they never received an \"unsatisfactory\" effort grade in any sport during their four years in the upper school.\n\nAs a co-founder of the oldest High School sport's league in America, the \"[[Inter-Academic League]],\" and in the second oldest school rivalry in the nation, (against [[the Haverford School]], later adding [[Agnes Irwin School]]) Episcopal Academy athletic teams have gained a national reputation. The boys basketball team, coached by Daniel Dougherty, gained national attention in 2005 and 2006, with full team effort including players Gerald Henderson '06 and Wayne Ellington '06.  Both were nationally ranked high school basketball players.  Henderson signed to play for [[Duke University]] while Ellington signed to play for the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].\n\nSports offered in the fall include cross country, soccer, water polo, and crew for both boys and girls. Football is offered just for boys, and tennis and field hockey are offered just for girls.\n\nSports offered in the winter include basketball, squash, swimming and diving, and winter track for both boys and girls.  Ice hockey and wrestling are offered just for boys.  A coed team is fielded in ultimate frisbee.\n\nSpring sports include crew, golf, lacrosse, and track for both boys and girls.  Baseball and tennis are offered just for boys. Softball is offered just for girls.\n\nIntramural sports such as [[paddle tennis]] and bike polo are also offered.\n\n====Events====\n\n=====A Centennial athletic tradition=====\nThe Episcopal Academy carries a tradition of inter-league competition, notably through Haverford-Irwin's Weekend.  Formerly known as Haverford Day, this tradition of competition with the Haverford School of Haverford, Pennsylvania, was established when EA was still an all-boys school, but in 2006 the rivalry and day of events was extended to include girls' athletic competition against the Agnes Irwin School of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\nEvery November, the three Inter-Academic rivals meet to compete against each other in cross country, football, soccer, field hockey, girls' tennis, and water polo. The venue alternates each year between the schools.  The weekend is preceded by \"Spirit Week,\" marked by various activities intended to energize the students for the weekend of competition and spectatorship.  Spirit Week concludes with an Upper School Pep Rally on Friday.\nOn Friday, Episcopal and Agnes Irwin (female competitors) compete in cross country, soccer, field hockey, and tennis. On Saturday, Episcopal and Haverford compete in soccer, cross country, waterpolo and [[List of high school football rivalries (100 years+)|one of the oldest football rivalries in the nation]]. The girls compete for the \"banner\" and the boys compete for the \"sweater\" which is presented to the school which wins 3 of the 4 competitive events. In the event of a tie the schools split ownership of the banner or the sweater for the year.\n\n===Religion and service===\n[[File:Episcopal Acad Chapel ext.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Episcopal Academy Chapel, designed by alumnus [[Robert Venturi]]]]\n\n====The chapel program====\nUpper School students meet once every other day for a morning chapel service in the Class of 1944 Chapel.  Middle School Chapel also meets once every other day for a morning chapel service in Christ Chapel.  Lower School Chapel meets once a week.  The Chapel service typically gives students a thirty-minute break during the school day and consists of student musical offering (violin, piano or an organ-prelude), hymns, prayers, and an address by the chaplain, a member of the faculty, a student, or a guest. An elected student vestry plans most aspects of the chapel program.  The students casually exit the chapel in single-file as a postlude carries through the campus.\n\n====Community service====\nThe Academy also runs an extensive community service program, and organizes weekly visits to a soup kitchen in Philadelphia as well as monthly visits to a nursing home and to a facility for adults with AIDS.  The Academy also participates in a tutoring program where students help younger children with their homework after school.  In addition, the Community Service office sponsors other special events throughout the year, including a clothing drive, a toy drive, and a blood drive.\n===Facilities===\n\n\n====Buildings====\n\n{{Prose|section|date=April 2019}}\n*Academic Center, with the Middle School, Upper School, and Science Center.\n*Lower School Building\n*Crawford Campus Center, including the Annenberg Library\n*Theater with Stadium Seating\n*Chapel, at the Center of Campus\n*Athletic Center, with a competition gymnasium and pool\n*Stadium Football Field\n*Black Box Theatre\n*Head of School's House\n*Chaplain's House\n\n==Notable alumni, faculty, and others==\n{{main|List of Episcopal Academy people}}\n\nAcademy Founder [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] wanted EA to be a place to produce \"leaders of society.\"  Episcopal also has a tradition of distinguished faculty.\n\nAlumni have won [[Academy Awards]], [[Emmy Awards]], [[Pulitzer Prizes]], [[Pritzker Prizes]] and one a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighthood]].

However, restoration work in 1904\u20131905 caused the removal of overpainting that revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]]. This indicated that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have explainsd this to be because most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over who the subject is has caused many Italian musicians and politicians to be proposed as the young man. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/> It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> \n\n===The Musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score.]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson237\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 237</ref> He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint|underpainted]] brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp. 92</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart73\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 73</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/> The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.<ref name=\"Pedretti\">Pedretti 1989, pp. 68</ref> A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defned Leonardo claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url-access=subscription |url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\">Z\u00f6llner 2015, pp. 45</ref> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |authorlink=Carmen C.

However, restoration work in 1904\u20131905 caused the removal of overpainting that revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]]. This indicated that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have explainsd this to be because most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over who the subject is has caused many Italian musicians and politicians to be proposed as the young man. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/l/leonardo/03/1musicia.html |author1=Kr\u00e9n, Emil |author2=Marx, Daniel |title=Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/> It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.<ref name=\"Palmer\"/> \n\n===The Musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score.]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson237\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 237</ref> He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint|underpainted]] brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp. 92</ref><ref name=\"Fagnart73\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 73</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/> The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.<ref name=\"Pedretti\">Pedretti 1989, pp. 68</ref> A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defned Leonardo claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url-access=subscription |url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref><ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/>\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson237\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\">Z\u00f6llner 2015, pp. 45</ref> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.<ref name=\"Fagnart77\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/><ref name=\"Kemp\"/> This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commision a portrait himself.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n*{{cite magazine |last=Bambach |first=Carmen C. |authorlink=Carmen C.

For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] (Doge's Palace), because he feared they would soon be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.\n\nWhen she met Millais five years later, she was still a virgin, as Ruskin had persistently put off [[consummate|consummating]] the marriage. Gray and Ruskin had agreed upon abstaining from sex for five years to allow Ruskin to focus on his studies.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another reason may have involved his disgust with some aspect of her body. As she later wrote to her father,\n\n<blockquote>He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason...  that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.<ref name=\"Hewison1979\">{{cite book|author=Robert Hewison|title=John Ruskin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XjntfarTykC&pg=PA201|year=1979|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=201\u2013202|id=GGKEY:8PSQ7NGSATA}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRuskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: \"It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.\"<ref>Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p.191</ref> The reason for Ruskin's disgust with \"circumstances in her person\" is unknown.

She then became close to Millais when he accompanied the couple on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait according to the critic's artistic principles. During this time, spent in [[Brig o' Turk]] in the [[Trossachs]], they fell in love. While working on the portrait of her husband, Millais made many drawings and sketches of her. He also sent humorous cartoons of himself, Effie and Ruskin to friends. She copied some of his works.\n\nAfter their return to London, she left Ruskin, nominally to visit her family.

She had previously been married to the critic [[John Ruskin]], but the marriage was annulled, and she left him without it having been consummated. This famous Victorian \"[[love triangle]]\" has been dramatised in plays, films and an opera.\n\n==Early life==\nEuphemia Chalmers Gray, initially known by the pet name of \"Phemy\", later as \"Effie,\" was born on 7 May 1828 to Sophia Margaret Gray and George Gray in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]].

Millais\".]]\nGray's family knew Ruskin's father, and they encouraged a match between Ruskin and Gray. Ruskin wrote the fantasy novel ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' for her in 1841, when she was twelve years old. She married Ruskin when she was only 20 years old.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pre-Raphaelite Girl Gang|last=Walker|first=Kirsty Stonell|publisher=Unicorn|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}</ref> After their marriage in 1848,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Order of Release: The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais Told for the First Time in their Unpublished Letters|year=1948|publisher=J.

For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] (Doge's Palace), because he feared they would soon be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.\n\nWhen she met Millais five years later, she was still a virgin, as Ruskin had persistently put off [[consummate|consummating]] the marriage. Gray and Ruskin had agreed upon abstaining from sex for five years to allow Ruskin to focus on his studies.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another reason may have involved his disgust with some aspect of her body. As she later wrote to her father,\n\n<blockquote>He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason...  that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.<ref name=\"Hewison1979\">{{cite book|author=Robert Hewison|title=John Ruskin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XjntfarTykC&pg=PA201|year=1979|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=201\u2013202|id=GGKEY:8PSQ7NGSATA}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRuskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: \"It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.\"<ref>Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p.191</ref> The reason for Ruskin's disgust with \"circumstances in her person\" is unknown.

She then became close to Millais when he accompanied the couple on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait according to the critic's artistic principles. During this time, spent in [[Brig o' Turk]] in the [[Trossachs]], they fell in love. While working on the portrait of her husband, Millais made many drawings and sketches of her.

Many of the Union generals would eventually be memorialized in [[Washington, D.C.]], with statues spread throughout the city.  While looking at one of his comrade's equestrian sculptures, Sheridan was not impressed with the depiction of the man and horse.  He reportedly told his wife \"Whatever you do after I'm gone, don't put me on a horse like that.\"  Following her husband's death in 1888, when an equestrian sculpture of her husband was being planned, Irene Sheridan insisted the horse be as \"proud and courageous as its rider.\"<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, Part 3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6HIB4fNjGoC&lpg=PA71&ots=kteSt_qrPZ&dq=Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20Memorial%20%28Stephenson%29&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q=Sheridan&f=false | location=Baltimore | publisher=JHU Press | pages=134\u2013138 | date=1998 | isbn=9780801858611 | accessdate=November 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 1889, Congress authorized the erection of a memorial to Sheridan and appropriated $50,000 for its construction.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=greiner>{{cite book | author=Greiner, Henry C. | title=General Phil Sheridan as I knew him, playmate \u2013 comrade \u2013 friend | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJwvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Philip%20Sheridan%20Gutzon&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Philip%20Sheridan%20Gutzon&f=false | location=Chicago | publisher=J.S.

While looking at one of his comrade's equestrian sculptures, Sheridan was not impressed with the depiction of the man and horse.  He reportedly told his wife \"Whatever you do after I'm gone, don't put me on a horse like that.\"  Following her husband's death in 1888, when an equestrian sculpture of her husband was being planned, Irene Sheridan insisted the horse be as \"proud and courageous as its rider.\"<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, Part 3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6HIB4fNjGoC&lpg=PA71&ots=kteSt_qrPZ&dq=Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20Memorial%20%28Stephenson%29&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q=Sheridan&f=false | location=Baltimore | publisher=JHU Press | pages=134\u2013138 | date=1998 | isbn=9780801858611 | accessdate=November 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 1889, Congress authorized the erection of a memorial to Sheridan and appropriated $50,000 for its construction.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=greiner>{{cite book | author=Greiner, Henry C. | title=General Phil Sheridan as I knew him, playmate \u2013 comrade \u2013 friend | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJwvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Philip%20Sheridan%20Gutzon&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Philip%20Sheridan%20Gutzon&f=false | location=Chicago | publisher=J.S.

They are used by the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles.

''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' introduced earlier models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT).

They can outrun opponents that underestimate {{nowrap|AT-AT}} walking speed, while their neck can pivot quickly enough to bring their heavy weaponry to bear against even fast-moving craft like snowspeeders. Their blasters and laser cannons do not have a high rate of fire, but the shots are powerful enough to destroy most small targets in one to two shots. Their armor is resistant to most standard blaster weapons; however, the \"neck\" column of the walker holds no such invulnerability and, if shot, can cause the entire walker to be destroyed.\n\nThe AT-AT is the primary assault vehicle during the [[Battle of Hoth]], first depicted in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. In the film, the squadron of {{nowrap|AT-ATs}}, lead by General Maximilian Veers, are responsible for destroying the shield generator protecting the Rebel headquarters, taking out soldiers, artillery batteries, and snowspeeders in the process. [[Luke Skywalker]], realizing that the walkers are all but impervious to artillery and snowspeeder blaster fire, orders his squadron's [[snowspeeder]]s to entangle their legs with [[tow cable]]s, a trick he remembered using on Tatooine to rein in hard-to-control farm animals. [[Wedge Antilles]] and his gunner Wes Janson successfully bring down an AT-AT using the tow cable: shortly after, another snowspeeder scores a direct hit on the fallen AT-AT's neck, causing a huge explosion. Skywalker, after being shot down and narrowly escaping his stricken snowspeeder before it is crushed beneath the AT-AT's leg, used his hoist cable to latch upon that AT-AT's underside, with a slash of his Lightsaber cutting away a panel so he can toss a thermal detonator inside, causing a series of internal explosions culminating with the cockpit and the walker toppling over. In the novelization of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', General Veers' {{nowrap|AT-AT}} is destroyed when its cockpit is rammed by a snowspeeder piloted by Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, however this never made it into the final cut of the film.\n\nAn AT-AT makes a brief appearance in ''Return of the Jedi''; one walks up alongside a landing platform on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] to deliver Luke to [[Darth Vader]]. \n\nThe first appearance of an {{nowrap|AT-AT}} in the ''Star Wars Rebels'' TV series occurs in [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 2 (2015)|the second-season episode]] \"Relics of the Old Republic\", when [[Agent Kallus]] unsuccessfully confronts the rebels while on Seelos, with a trio of the four-legged walkers challenging Captain Rex's retired clone cohorts and their own much-modified {{nowrap|AT-TE}} six-legged walker, where the rebels are hiding out. This walker is significantly bigger than those seen in the films and depicts an earlier model.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nA ruined {{nowrap|AT-AT}} appears in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' as the makeshift home of the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] on the planet Jakku.\n\nThe First Order uses an updated model of the AT-AT during the Battle of Crait at the end of ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'' alongside a similar but larger walker called the AT-M6.\n\nThe theme park attraction [[Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance]], set after ''The Last Jedi'', features two full-sized AT-ATs in a hangar bay. These walkers, while mostly static, can move their cannons to allow for a scene in which the walker's drivers spot the ride vehicles and fire at them.\n\n\n==All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)==\n{{Infobox fictional vehicle\n| name                = All Terrain Scout Transport\n| series              = Star Wars\n| image               = File:Star Wars All Terrain Scout Transport.jpg\n| alt                 =\n| caption             = An AT-ST walker, as depicted in ''Return of the Jedi''\n| first_major         = [[The Empire Strikes Back]]<br /> [[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]\n| first_minor         =\n| first_date          =\n| last_major          = [[The Mandalorian]]<br /> [[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order|Jedi: Fallen Order]]\n| last_minor          =\n| last_date           =\n| creator             = Kuat Drive Yards\n| based_on            = <!-- if not an original creation, use {{based on|vehicle|author}} -->\n| affiliation         = First Galactic Imperial Army\n| launched            =\n| decommissioned      =\n| captain             =\n| fighters            =\n| aux_vehicle         = {{plainlist|\n*550 metric tons cargo capacity\n}}\n| class               = Walker\n| registry            =\n| armaments           ={{plainlist|\n*Cheek-mounted Yaove Gunsmiths 88i twin light blaster cannon\n*Cheek-mounted Dymek DW-3 concussion grenade launcher\n*Grenade/Missile launcher\n}}\n| defense             = <!-- or |defence= -->\n| max_speed           = 90 km/h\n| propulsion          =\n| chassis             =\n| power               =\n| mass                =\n| length              = \n| width               =4.5m\n| height              = 9.4m\n| population_volume   = {{plainlist|\n*2 Pilots\n*1 Passenger\n}}\n}}\n\nThe All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) is a two-legged [[mech]] walker introduced briefly in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and featured extensively in ''Return of the Jedi''.

They are used by the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles.

Their blasters and laser cannons do not have a high rate of fire, but the shots are powerful enough to destroy most small targets in one to two shots.

In the film, the squadron of {{nowrap|AT-ATs}}, lead by General Maximilian Veers, are responsible for destroying the shield generator protecting the Rebel headquarters, taking out soldiers, artillery batteries, and snowspeeders in the process. [[Luke Skywalker]], realizing that the walkers are all but impervious to artillery and snowspeeder blaster fire, orders his squadron's [[snowspeeder]]s to entangle their legs with [[tow cable]]s, a trick he remembered using on Tatooine to rein in hard-to-control farm animals. [[Wedge Antilles]] and his gunner Wes Janson successfully bring down an AT-AT using the tow cable: shortly after, another snowspeeder scores a direct hit on the fallen AT-AT's neck, causing a huge explosion. Skywalker, after being shot down and narrowly escaping his stricken snowspeeder before it is crushed beneath the AT-AT's leg, used his hoist cable to latch upon that AT-AT's underside, with a slash of his Lightsaber cutting away a panel so he can toss a thermal detonator inside, causing a series of internal explosions culminating with the cockpit and the walker toppling over. In the novelization of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', General Veers' {{nowrap|AT-AT}} is destroyed when its cockpit is rammed by a snowspeeder piloted by Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, however this never made it into the final cut of the film.\n\nAn AT-AT makes a brief appearance in ''Return of the Jedi''; one walks up alongside a landing platform on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] to deliver Luke to [[Darth Vader]]. \n\nThe first appearance of an {{nowrap|AT-AT}} in the ''Star Wars Rebels'' TV series occurs in [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 2 (2015)|the second-season episode]] \"Relics of the Old Republic\", when [[Agent Kallus]] unsuccessfully confronts the rebels while on Seelos, with a trio of the four-legged walkers challenging Captain Rex's retired clone cohorts and their own much-modified {{nowrap|AT-TE}} six-legged walker, where the rebels are hiding out.
