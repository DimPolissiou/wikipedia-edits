{"title_page": "List of college athletic programs in Ohio", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe main article is '''[[College sports]]'''.\n\n'''Notes:'''\n*This list is in a tabular format, with columns arranged in the following order, from left to right:\n**Athletic team description (short school name and nickname), with a link to the school's athletic program article if it exists. When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but media now use \"Charleston\" for that school's athletic program).\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=9|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Ice hockey !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

The plot revolves around Carmen Eguiluz (Angely Gaviria), a witch and slave from 1646, and is set both in the 17th-century and present-day [[Cartagena, Colombia]].<ref name=dailydot/>\n\nIt was ordered direct-to-series, and the first full season premiered on Netflix streaming on January 1, 2019. It was renewed by Netflix for a second season, which aired worldwide on February 28, 2020.<ref name=whatson/> The show is dubbed in English for US audiences.<ref name=romper/>\n\n==Premise==\nIn ''Always a Witch'', Carmen Eguiluz (Angely Gaviria) is accused of witchcraft and is set to burn at the stake according to the way of the Inquisition in the 1646 colonial Colombia. While imprisoned and waiting for her execution, Carmen makes a deal with the wizard Aldemar, which makes her able to time-travel to 2019 in exchange for a favor. She won't be able to use magic there though, since it would make Lucien, a powerful but evil wizard, aware of her presence.<ref name=decider/><ref name=femestella/><ref name=mediaversityreviews/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe series has received mixed reviews from critics.  While some praised the show for having a strong black female lead character, others have criticized the slave/slave master romance, and the lead character's willingness to return to the 1600s, thus returning to being a slave, just to be with her white slave master boyfriend.<ref name=whatson/><ref name=medium/><ref name=remezcla/><ref name=refinery29/><ref name=vox/>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Angely Gaviria]] as Carmen Eguiluz, a powerful witch from the 1640s who is propelled forward in time to 2019.\n* Lenard Vanderaa as Cristobal De Aranoa, Carmen's lover in 1646. \n* Carlos Quintero as Le\u00f3n, Mayte's boyfriend and one of Carmen's friends in 2019.  \n* [[Sebasti\u00e1n Eslava]] as Esteban, Carmen's, Le\u00f3n's, Alicia's, Mayte's and Daniel's professor in 2019. \n* Cristina Warner as Isabel de Aranoa, Cristobal's mother in 1646. \n* Sofia Bernal Araujo as Alicia, Carmen's friend in 2019. \n* [[Valeria Henr\u00edquez]] as Mayte, Le\u00f3n's girlfriend and one of Carmen's friends in 2019. \n* Dylan Fuentes as Johnny Ki, Carmen's best friend and confidante in 2019. \n* [[Ver\u00f3nica Orozco]] as Ninib\u00e9, a biology professor and Aldemar's proteg\u00e9 in 2019.

Aldemar confronts Sandra about the ''Book of Shadows'', but when asked for more time he turns her to ash to Ninibe's horror. Meanwhile, Leon reveals the truth of Carmen's origins and Aldemar to Detective Corcel, and Aldemar meets with Carmen to retrieve the stone. There, Aldemar reveals that Esteban escaped by joining him and attacks Carmen when she refuses to do the same. However, when Aldemar attempts to burn her alive, Esteban turns against him and receives a mortal wound.

television series starring [[Angely Gaviria]], Lenard Vanderaa and Carlos Quintero. The plot revolves around Carmen Eguiluz (Angely Gaviria), a witch and slave from 1646, and is set both in the 17th-century and present-day [[Cartagena, Colombia]].<ref name=dailydot/>\n\nIt was ordered direct-to-series, and the first full season premiered on Netflix streaming on January 1, 2019.

While imprisoned and waiting for her execution, Carmen makes a deal with the wizard Aldemar, which makes her able to time-travel to 2019 in exchange for a favor.

While some praised the show for having a strong black female lead character, others have criticized the slave/slave master romance, and the lead character's willingness to return to the 1600s, thus returning to being a slave, just to be with her white slave master boyfriend.<ref name=whatson/><ref name=medium/><ref name=remezcla/><ref name=refinery29/><ref name=vox/>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Angely Gaviria]] as Carmen Eguiluz, a powerful witch from the 1640s who is propelled forward in time to 2019.\n* Lenard Vanderaa as Cristobal De Aranoa, Carmen's lover in 1646. \n* Carlos Quintero as Le\u00f3n, Mayte's boyfriend and one of Carmen's friends in 2019.  \n* [[Sebasti\u00e1n Eslava]] as Esteban, Carmen's, Le\u00f3n's, Alicia's, Mayte's and Daniel's professor in 2019. \n* Cristina Warner as Isabel de Aranoa, Cristobal's mother in 1646. \n* Sofia Bernal Araujo as Alicia, Carmen's friend in 2019. \n* [[Valeria Henr\u00edquez]] as Mayte, Le\u00f3n's girlfriend and one of Carmen's friends in 2019. \n* Dylan Fuentes as Johnny Ki, Carmen's best friend and confidante in 2019. \n* [[Ver\u00f3nica Orozco]] as Ninib\u00e9, a biology professor and Aldemar's proteg\u00e9 in 2019.

Carmen is captured by the police. \n\nIn a flashback to 1646, Carmen is sold on the slave market. She is purchased by the family of Cristobal De Aranoa and the two fall in love. However, they are caught by Cristobal's mother, Isabel, who accuses Carmen of bewitching her son. Cristobal tries to defend her from the mob and is shot by his father. Carmen is thrown in prison where she meets a wizard, Aldemar the Immortal. He offers her a deal, he will save Cristobal if Carmen travels to the future to find a woman named Ninibe and break Aldemar's curse. He warns her that if she uses magic, she will summon the evil wizard Lucien.  \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A University Witch\n| DirectedBy      = Liliana Bocanegra\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Maria Parra \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Carmen is interrogated by Corcel, and is eventually released. A university student, Alicia, is also questioned as she was seen arguing with Ninibe shortly before the latter's disappearance. At the hostel, Johnny Ki sees Carmen levitating in her sleep and takes a video. Carmen follows Alicia to the University, believing her to be the disciple mentioned by Ninibe. She joins the class, now taught by Esteban. She joins Alicia and Daniel at a welcome party for the biology students and discovers she can see memories by touching people's skin. She follows Alicia to Ninibe's home where Alicia is trying to download files from Ninibe's computer. However, they are interrupted by another woman and Carmen helps Alicia escape. Alicia reveals that she is being blackmailed by her ex-boyfriend, Angel, with an incriminating video and that she had gone to Ninibe for help. Carmen gives Alicia a potion to make her ex-boyfriend forget their relationship. However, the potion fails and Angel sends the video to Alicia's close friends. Carmen meanwhile has a vision of Ninibe in a forest, and discovers a burned skeleton. She writes a letter to Cristobal and tucks it in the gap above the window where they used to leave each other messages. Johnny Ki confronts Carmen about being a witch and says he needs her help. \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Ouija \n| DirectedBy      = Louis Milito\n| WrittenBy       = Jason Ning & Jenn Kao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Stolen Shadow, Witch Forgotten \n| DirectedBy      = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Ildy Modrovich]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = The Festival of Candela \n| DirectedBy      = [[Tim Matheson]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Sheri Elwood]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = The Ritual of Forgetting \n| DirectedBy      = Mateo Stivelberg\n| WrittenBy       = Jason Ning\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Lucien\n| DirectedBy      = Mateo Stivelberg\n| WrittenBy       = Alex Katsnelson\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = 1646\n| DirectedBy      = Mateo Stivelberg\n| WrittenBy       = Jenn Kao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = The Time Portal \n| DirectedBy      = Mateo Stivelberg\n| WrittenBy       = [[Chris Rafferty]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = The Final Trip \n| DirectedBy      = Mateo Stivelberg\n| WrittenBy       = Alex Katsnelson & [[Mike Costa]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Carmen and her friends decide they must stop Aldemar. Meanwhile, Aldemar returns to the Time Portal with Ninibe so he might travel and find other great witches and wizards and learn their secrets, however the green stone is gone and Ninibe begins to suspect she is being used. Aldemar attacks and bewitches Daniel who tells Carmen that Esteban escaped and she will never see him again. Mayte and Alicia infiltrate Ninibe's Women's Circle in hopes of finding clues to Aldemar's or Esteban's whereabouts. There, Alicia witnesses Ninibe threaten Sandra into returning the ''Book of Shadows''. Ninibe then bewitches Mayte and Alicia. Carmen uses the Ouija board to contact Esteban but finds Aldemar instead. Aldemar claims that he will set Esteban free if Carmen delivers the green stone. Carmen concocts a plan to capture Aldemar unaware that several of her friends are now his unwilling agents. Aldemar confronts Sandra about the ''Book of Shadows'', but when asked for more time he turns her to ash to Ninibe's horror. Meanwhile, Leon reveals the truth of Carmen's origins and Aldemar to Detective Corcel, and Aldemar meets with Carmen to retrieve the stone. There, Aldemar reveals that Esteban escaped by joining him and attacks Carmen when she refuses to do the same. However, when Aldemar attempts to burn her alive, Esteban turns against him and receives a mortal wound. Johnny Ki steals Aldemar's shadow, freeing Daniel, Alicia and Mayte from his spell, and he dissolves into ash. Carmen, whose powers have returned, heals Esteban, and Corcel, who witnessed the entire showdown, leaves to take Ninibe into custody. Ninibe, however, proves she is not the Fire Killer with a video of Aldemar killing Sandra and Corcel is forced to let her go. Carmen uses her powers to allow Johnny Ki to say goodbye to his parents, gently rebuffs Esteban, and prepares to return to the past. Before she can, Cristobal arrives through the Portal and Carmen realizes that Johnny Ki has gone back in time to try and save his parents, mistakenly going to the 17th century. It is revealed that Johnny Ki has been captured by pirates, who take him aboard a ship to an unknown location. \n| LineColor       = FED403\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2020)===\n{{Episode table |background=#0244A4 |overall= |season=|title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Someone Like Me\n |DirectedBy      =  \n |WrittenBy       = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|28}}\n |ShortSummary    = Carmen and Alicia find Johnny Ki in the 17th century, but he begs them for more time in the past.

NYU is one of the top three largest landowners in New York City.<ref name=\"Curbed NY\" />\n\n==Washington Square campus==\n[[File:NYU Maison francaise.gif|thumb|300px|[[La Maison Fran\u00e7aise (New York University)|La Maison Fran\u00e7aise]]]]\n\nMost of NYU's buildings on the main campus are scattered across a roughly square area bounded by [[Houston Street]] to the south, [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the east, [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the north, and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas) to the west. Most of NYU's main buildings, including the [[Silver Center]], [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], [[New York University Stern School of Business|Stern School of Business]], [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute of Mathematics]], and the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts|Kimmel Center]], surround [[Gould Plaza]] and [[Washington Square Park]].\n\nSince the late 1970s, the central part of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]]. Despite being public property, and expanding the [[Fifth Avenue]] axis into Washington Square Park, the [[Washington Square Arch]] is the unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2008, NYU's [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony was held in Washington Square Park. However, due to space constraints, ceremonies are now held at the [[Yankee Stadium]]. Important facilities at Washington Square are the [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], who also designed several other structures, such as Tisch Hall, Meyer Hall, and the Hagop Kevorkian Center. When designing these buildings Johnson and Foster also set up a master plan for a complete redesign of the NYU Washington Square campus. However, it was never implemented. Other historic buildings include the [[Silver Center]] (formerly known as \"Main building\"); the [[Brown Building of Science]]; Judson Hall, which houses the King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] Center;<ref>http://www.nyu.edu/pages/kjc/flash.php</ref> Vanderbilt Hall, the historic townhouse row on [[Washington Square North]]; The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the [[New York University]] art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions;<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html Grey Art Gallery art collection] Retrieved March 5, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/ The Grey Art Gallery] Retrieved March 5, 2011</ref> the Kaufman Management Center; and the  Torch Club \u2013 the NYU dining and club facility for alumni, faculty, and administrators. Just a block south of Washington Square is NYU's [[Washington Square Village]], housing graduate students and junior and senior faculty residences in the Silver Towers, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], where an enlargement of Picasso's sculpture Bust of Sylvette (1934) is displayed.\n\nThe contractors of the Old University Building used prisoners from [[Sing Sing]] to cut the marble. This hiring was the catalyst for the famous [[Stonecutter's Riot]]. The old University Building was also subject to several ghost stories. It was believed that the building was haunted by a young artist resident who had died in one of the building's turrets. The spirit was said to pace through the hallways and staircases. In 1880, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that \"the structure has an evil repute with the servant girls of the neighborhood ... They have a notion that deep in subcellars lie corpses, skeletons and other dreadful things.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q6s3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA431|title=Ten Thousand Miles on a Bicycle|last=Bagg|first=Lyman Hotchkiss|date=1887|publisher=Karl Kron|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=431|language=en}}</ref> The [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] on March 25, 1911, took place in the Brown Building of Science (formerly the [[Asch Building]]) which today is part of the NYU campus. More than a hundred garment workers, most young women and girls, died or jumped to their deaths after a fire broke out whilst all exit doors were locked. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].\n\nIn the 1990s, NYU became a \"Two Square\" university by building a second community around [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], about a 10-minute walk from Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community consists of the upperclassmen residence halls of Carlyle Court, Palladium Residence Hall, University Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Towers, Thirteenth Street Hall, and Third North Residence Hall.\n\n===NYU theaters and clubs===\nNYU operates several theaters and performance facilities that are often used by the university's [[music conservatory]] and [[Tisch School of the Arts]] but also external productions. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the [[Skirball Center for Performing Arts]] (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South; and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center. Recently, the Skirball Center hosted important speeches on foreign policy by [[John Kerry]]<ref>John Kerry's speech at NYU http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm</ref> and [[Al Gore]]<ref>Al Gore's speech at NYU {{cite web |url=http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715151552/http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}</ref> as well as the recording of the season finale of [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]] 3. Well-known also is NYU's Provincetown Playhouse on MacDougal Street, where Eugene O'Neill among many others launched his career and the Frederick Loewe Theatre outside Gould Plaza. Catalyst to many careers in music (Bruce Springsteen began his career here among many others) was the famous nightclub The Bottom Line, found on the corner of West 4th and Mercer Streets. Despite the objections of many supporters, this club was evicted by NYU after being unable to meet for several months the increased rent payments.\n\n===Bobst Library===\nThe [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at NYU and one of the largest academic libraries in the U.S. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], the 12-story, {{Convert|425,000|ft2|m2}} structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park and is the flagship of an eight-library, 4.5 million volume system that provides students and faculty members with access to the world's scholarship and serves as a center for the University's intellectual life. Bobst Library contains more than 3.3 million volumes, 20,000 journals, and more than 3.5 million microforms. The library is visited by more than 6,500 users each day, and circulates almost one million books annually.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/about/library.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708230006/http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/about/library.html# |archive-date=2007-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to its regular collection it houses a number of special collections and archives, including the Archives of Irish America and the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]].\n\nThe floor of the library, when viewed from above, was designed to appear three-dimensional. In late 2003, Bobst Library was the site of two suicidal incidents. Two students jumped from the open-air crosswalks inside the library onto the marble floor below. The students later died of their injuries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyusuicides.com/mediaclips005.html# |title=Media Clips<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504132957/http://www.nyusuicides.com/mediaclips005.html# |archive-date=2007-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the second suicide, NYU installed plexi-glass windows on each level to prevent further attempts. In 2003, Bobst Library was also in the news for being the home of a [[Bobst Boy|homeless student]] who resided at the library because he could not afford student housing.<ref>[http://www.homelessatnyu.com/ charity age concern donation fund at homelessatnyu.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3665885.stm Broke student 'slept in library']\n\n===Real estate and development===\nGreenwich Village has long had a mixed relationship with NYU. Residents and university leaders frequently have differing views on how the school, its buildings and its students should interact with the neighborhood.<ref name=\"Curbed NY\">{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Eli|title=After A Long War, Can NYU and the Village Ever Make Peace?|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/03/19/after_a_long_war_can_nyu_and_the_village_ever_make_peace.php|work=Curbed NY|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe tearing down of a block of tenements and brownstones in 1950 for construction of Vanderbilt Hall, the law school, was a signal of things to come. Residents both mourned the loss of the old block, on Washington Square South between [[MacDougal Street|MacDougal]] and [[Sullivan Street]]s, and worried about the university dominating the Washington Square area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grabar|first1=Henry|title=A Brief History of NYU Land Battles|url=http://www.citylab.com/politics/2012/07/brief-history-nyu-land-battles/2600/|publisher=The Atlantic Citylab|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> Following the closure of the Bronx campus (see History section above), the school expanded downtown, growing significantly \u2013 both in student body size and academic and dormitory footprint \u2013 from the 1980s through the present.<ref name=\"Curbed NY\"/>\n\nIn addition to the sheer mass of the school's real estate holdings, its approach to architecture has often been criticized. From 1964, when noted architecture critic [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that NYU had a \"consistent blindness to the area's architectural and historical features\",<ref>Ibid {{clarify|date=August 2017|post-text=Ibid where?}}</ref> to 2013, when critic James Russell wrote that \"for decades, New York University has waged architectural war on Greenwich Village\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=James|title=NYU Blights Village With Dumpsters, Fencing, Concrete|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-11/nyu-blights-village-with-dumpsters-fencing-concrete.html|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> the school has developed a reputation for construction that is insensitive to both aesthetic and community concerns.\n\nWhile the Bobst Library, built in 1973, and the many dorms built throughout the 1980s and 1990s all had their detractors, construction of the Kimmel Center for University Life (opened 2003) on Washington Square South sparked broader attention. Critics said the building would ruin the Fifth Avenue view through the Washington Square Arch and cast a shadow on the park, issues impacting a broader swath of city residents and tourists. Over the years, a local preservation group, the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), has been a vocal opponent of NYU.<ref>{{cite web|title=After the Kimmel Center: How Can We Better Plan to Protect Our Neighborhoods, Parks and View Corridors?|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/nyu/doc/after-kimmel.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> GVSHP was one of several dozen participants, including NYU itself, in the Community Task Force on NYU Development, which was convened by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer in 2006. \"In order to maintain the integrity of the affected neighborhoods, the University's goals for growth and development must be better aligned with those of the community at large\" stated the Findings and Recommendations report of March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Task Force on NYU Development|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb2/downloads/pdf/task_force_recommendations.1.pdf|publisher=Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> Controversies in recent years include:\n\n* Edgar Allan Poe house \u2013 As the university contemplated new construction to expand its law school, preservationists called for protection of 85 West [[Third Street (Manhattan)|Third Street]], where Poe lived from 1844 through early 1846. It is where he wrote \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\" and revised and published \"[[The Raven]]\". They asked the Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect the building, but it did not, so they also filed suit to save it. NYU officials said they did not consider the Poe house, or the Judson House on the same block (between Sullivan and [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]]s), important enough to save.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Siegal|first1=Nina|title=Rapping on Poe's Door, A Hint of Nevermore; Anger in Village Over N.Y.U.

On the site of the demolished St. Ann's Church on East 12th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, the university planned to build a dorm and solicited community input on its plans. The community asked that the 240-foot-tall building be scaled back, only to find in 2006 that construction plans were moving ahead to build a 26-story dormitory. That building, Founder's Hall, now towers over one preserved wall of the former St. Ann's Church, the gray stone fa\u00e7ade facing E. 12th Street.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Lincoln|title=Conceding nothing, N.Y.U. starts building megadorm|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_170/concedingnothingnyu.html|work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|accessdate=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820064150/http://thevillager.com/villager_170/concedingnothingnyu.html|archive-date=20 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Provincetown Playhouse and Apartments \u2013 Located at 133-139 MacDougal Street, this four-story complex hosted performances of works by playwrights from Edna St. Vincent Millay to Eugene O'Neill to Sam Shepard in its playhouse, while artists and others found shelter in the apartments above.

In the face of community opposition, NYU agreed to preserve just six percent of the old building: the walls containing the small theater in the southern corner of the building. However, during construction, behind construction barriers and invisible from the street, NYU secretly tore down parts of the walls they promised to preserve, a fact publicly revealed by GVSHP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Re: Failure to Maintain Commitments re:Provincetown Playhouse Theater Restoration|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/ptown/doc/ltr-nyu-11-19-10.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>  \n* NYU 2031 \u2013 This ambitious plan for the university's expansion was met by wide resistance both among unaffiliated city residents, and among university faculty and staff.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Joseph|title=N.Y.U.'s Plan for Expansion Draws Anger in Community|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nyregion/nyu-expansion-plan-upsets-some-greenwich-village-neighbors.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> Not only did community members consider the plan itself an abrogation of the \"Planning Principles\" that came out of the Community Task Force, but a new group formed called NYU Faculty Against the Sexton Plan (NYU FASP).

The center also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner & Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The Jack H.

It is centrally located in the [[MetroTech Center]] and is close to transportation routes and easily accessible from all parts of New York City and Long Island. The Brooklyn campus offers programs for undergraduates students as well as for graduate students, including those executive programs for students with related experience.\n\nThe engineering school played a leadership role in bringing about MetroTech Center, one of the largest urban university-corporate parks in the world and the largest in the United States. Today, the 16-acre (65,000 m\u00b2), $1 billion complex is home to the institute and several technology-dependent companies, including Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC), New York City Police Department's 911 Center, New York City Fire Department Headquarters and the U.S. technology and operations functions of JPMorgan Chase. In 1998, a Marriott Hotel was built adjacent to MetroTech. MetroTech has proven to be a case study in effective university, corporate, government and private-developer cooperation. It has resulted in renewing an area that once was characterized more by urban decay.\n\nThe [[Wunsch Building]] which now houses the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development's Brooklyn Office, dates back to 1847 and was the first independent black church in Brooklyn. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad and has been designated a historic landmark since November 24, 1981.\n\nThe Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology, opened in 1990, is the engineering school's library.  In addition, wireless networks allow users with notebook computers to access the library's electronic services from anywhere on campus.\n\nThe Brooklyn campus also houses the [[Center for Urban Science and Progress]] as well as several of [[Tisch School of the Arts]]<ref name=\"animationcareerreview.com\">http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/top-50-game-design-schools-and-colleges-us-%E2%80%93-2015</ref> and [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]]'s degree programs.<ref>http://magnet.nyu.edu/</ref> The Brooklyn campus houses NYU's Game Center Open Library, which is the largest collection of games held by any university in the world.<ref name=\"animationcareerreview.com\"/> In 2014, [[NYU Langone Medical Center]] acquired a 125,000 square foot healthcare facility in Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Mary|title=NYU Langone to take over LICH emergency department in Brooklyn on Friday|url=http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2014/10/29/nyu-langone-take-over-lich-emergency-department-brooklyn-friday|website=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|accessdate=April 4, 2016|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDesign and engineering work for the full renovation and fit-out of [[370 Jay Street]] in Brooklyn is underway.

The campus hosts the Medical School, Tisch Hospital, and the [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Other NYU Centers across the city include NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and the Bellevue Hospital Center. NYU's Ehrenkranz School of Social Work manages branch campus programs in Westchester County at [[Manhattanville College]] and in [[Rockland County]] at [[St. Thomas Aquinas College]]. In Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York, NYU has a research facility that contains several institutes, in particular the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine. The Midtown Center at 11 West 42nd Street and the [[Woolworth Building]] in the financial district are home to NYU's continuing education programs.\n\n===Recent construction===\n* Ronald O.

One noteworthy example is the {{convert|57|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus of NYU Florence at [[Villa La Pietra]] in Italy, bequeathed by the late Sir [[Harold Acton]] to NYU in 1994.<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/16/01/Stories/LaPietra.html NYU Today<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> NYU manages undergraduate academic year study abroad programs at [[NYU Florence]], [[NYU London]], [[NYU Paris]], NYU Prague, NYU Berlin, NYU Accra, NYU Madrid, [[NYU Shanghai]], NYU Buenos Aires, NYU Tel Aviv, [[NYU Abu Dhabi]], NYU Washington, DC, and NYU Sydney.\n\n==International houses on campus==\nNYU has several international houses to foster the study of international culture and languages. The international houses have their own classroom space, libraries, offices, and often host campus events. The NYU international houses are:\n* [[Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2]]\n* [[La Maison Fran\u00e7aise (New York University)|La Maison Fran\u00e7aise]]\n* Deutsches Haus<ref>[http://deutscheshaus.as.nyu.edu/page/home Deutsches Haus]</ref>\n* Glucksman Ireland House<ref>[http://www.irelandhouse.fas.nyu.edu Glucksman Ireland House]</ref>\n* King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center\n* Hagop Kevorkian Center<ref>[http://neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu/page/home Hagop Kevorkian Center]</ref>\n* Africa House\n* China House\n\nNYU was also the founding member of the [[League of World Universities]].\n\n==Residence halls==\n[[File:NYU Founders Hall St. Ann's Church.jpg|thumb|right|Founder's Hall]]\n{{Main|NYU residence halls}}\nWith 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh largest university housing system in the U.S. and the largest among private schools.<ref>[http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html UM General Information<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305034155/http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html |date=2007-03-05 }}</ref> Uniquely, many of NYU residence halls are converted apartment complexes or old hotels. Most freshman residence halls are in the Washington Square area. While nearly all the upper classmen dorms are in the Union Square area, a few of them are as far as the [[Financial District, Manhattan]]. Until the Spring 2005 semester, NYU used a lottery system to determine eligibility for residence hall preference. Under this system, a student received one point for every semester they had lived in campus housing. Freshmen are freed from the lottery system and are by tradition placed in the halls closest to the main campus area. Therefore, historically, most of the students who lived in dorms found off-campus were sophomores. However, beginning in the fall 2006 semester, sophomores received priority housing, giving them first choice of residence halls. The purpose of this initiative was to keep the sophomore class together in the [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] area. As a result, the junior class (class of 2008) and the senior class (class of 2007) never benefited from first choice as sophomores or seniors. The university operates its own transit system to transport its students, by bus or trolley, to campus. Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU.\n\nTwenty-two buildings are in NYU's undergraduate housing system in the United States. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens and living rooms/common areas, one residence hall even has maid service. All residence halls are staffed by 24-hour security staff, contain multiple [[resident assistant]]s (RAs), and several halls contain faculty in residence. Unlike many other universities, NYU rooms all have their own bathrooms and thus no common bathrooms exist. Many residence halls have their own dining hall, and the university has meal choices to suit various diets. Almost all the residence halls have a [[laundry]] room that is open to resident students 24 hours a day.\n\nAll the residence halls are governed by the [[Residence hall association|Inter-Residence Hall Council]] (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization. Each hall elects student representatives to the IRHC, and those representatives meet with one another to form committees and vote on an executive board. The goal of this group is to create programs for university students and to act as a link to university administration. [[Hometalk]] ranked NYU's student residences third in the United States in its list of best college dorms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hometalk.com/6444015/most-impressive-dorms |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504063304/http://www.hometalk.com/6444015/most-impressive-dorms |archive-date=2016-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Recent acquisitions==\nSome of the recent acquisitions include, among others:\n\n*In 2010, NYU purchased a 125,000 square foot building.

Most of NYU's main buildings, including the [[Silver Center]], [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], and the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts|Kimmel Center]], surround [[Washington Square Park]].\n\nSince the late 1970s, the central part of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]]. Despite being public property, and expanding the [[Fifth Avenue]] axis into Washington Square Park, the [[Washington Square Arch]] is the unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2008, NYU's [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony was held in Washington Square Park. However, due to space constraints, ceremonies are now held at the [[Yankee Stadium]]. Important facilities at Washington Square are the [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], who also designed several other structures, such as Tisch Hall, Meyer Hall, and the Hagop Kevorkian Center. When designing these buildings Johnson and Foster also set up a master plan for a complete redesign of the NYU Washington Square campus. However, it was never implemented. Other historic buildings include the [[Silver Center]] (formerly known as \"Main building\"); the [[Brown Building of Science]]; Judson Hall, which houses the King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] Center;<ref>http://www.nyu.edu/pages/kjc/flash.php</ref> Vanderbilt Hall, the historic townhouse row on [[Washington Square North]]; The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the [[New York University]] art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions;<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html Grey Art Gallery art collection] Retrieved March 5, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/ The Grey Art Gallery] Retrieved March 5, 2011</ref> the Kaufman Management Center; and the  Torch Club \u2013 the NYU dining and club facility for alumni, faculty, and administrators. Just a block south of Washington Square is NYU's [[Washington Square Village]], housing graduate students and junior and senior faculty residences in the Silver Towers, designed by [[I. M. Pei]], where an enlargement of Picasso's sculpture Bust of Sylvette (1934) is displayed.\n\nThe contractors of the Old University Building used prisoners from [[Sing Sing]] to cut the marble. This hiring was the catalyst for the famous [[Stonecutter's Riot]]. The old University Building was also subject to several ghost stories. It was believed that the building was haunted by a young artist resident who had died in one of the building's turrets. The spirit was said to pace through the hallways and staircases. In 1880, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that \"the structure has an evil repute with the servant girls of the neighborhood ... They have a notion that deep in subcellars lie corpses, skeletons and other dreadful things.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q6s3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA431|title=Ten Thousand Miles on a Bicycle|last=Bagg|first=Lyman Hotchkiss|date=1887|publisher=Karl Kron|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=431|language=en}}</ref> The [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] on March 25, 1911, took place in the Brown Building of Science (formerly the [[Asch Building]]) which today is part of the NYU campus. More than a hundred garment workers, most young women and girls, died or jumped to their deaths after a fire broke out whilst all exit doors were locked. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].\n\nIn the 1990s, NYU became a \"Two Square\" university by building a second community around [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], about a 10-minute walk from Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community consists of the upperclassmen residence halls of Carlyle Court, Palladium Residence Hall, University Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Towers, Thirteenth Street Hall, and Third North Residence Hall.\n\n===NYU theaters and clubs===\nNYU operates several theaters and performance facilities that are often used by the university's [[music conservatory]] and [[Tisch School of the Arts]] but also external productions. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the [[Skirball Center for Performing Arts]] (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South; and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center. Recently, the Skirball Center hosted important speeches on foreign policy by [[John Kerry]]<ref>John Kerry's speech at NYU http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm</ref> and [[Al Gore]]<ref>Al Gore's speech at NYU {{cite web |url=http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715151552/http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}</ref> as well as the recording of the season finale of [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]] 3. Well-known also is NYU's Provincetown Playhouse on MacDougal Street, where Eugene O'Neill among many others launched his career and the Frederick Loewe Theatre. Catalyst to many careers in music (Bruce Springsteen began his career here among many others) was the famous nightclub The Bottom Line, found on the corner of West 4th and Mercer Streets. Despite the objections of many supporters, this club was evicted by NYU after being unable to meet for several months the increased rent payments.\n\n===Bobst Library===\nThe [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]], built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at NYU and one of the largest academic libraries in the U.S. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], the 12-story, {{Convert|425,000|ft2|m2}} structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park and is the flagship of an eight-library, 4.5 million volume system that provides students and faculty members with access to the world's scholarship and serves as a center for the University's intellectual life. Bobst Library contains more than 3.3 million volumes, 20,000 journals, and more than 3.5 million microforms. The library is visited by more than 6,500 users each day, and circulates almost one million books annually.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/about/library.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708230006/http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/about/library.html# |archive-date=2007-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to its regular collection it houses a number of special collections and archives, including the Archives of Irish America and the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F.

Critics said the building would ruin the Fifth Avenue view through the Washington Square Arch and cast a shadow on the park, issues impacting a broader swath of city residents and tourists. Over the years, a local preservation group, the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), has been a vocal opponent of NYU.<ref>{{cite web|title=After the Kimmel Center: How Can We Better Plan to Protect Our Neighborhoods, Parks and View Corridors?|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/nyu/doc/after-kimmel.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> GVSHP was one of several dozen participants, including NYU itself, in the Community Task Force on NYU Development, which was convened by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer in 2006. \"In order to maintain the integrity of the affected neighborhoods, the University's goals for growth and development must be better aligned with those of the community at large\" stated the Findings and Recommendations report of March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Task Force on NYU Development|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb2/downloads/pdf/task_force_recommendations.1.pdf|publisher=Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> Controversies in recent years include:\n\n* Edgar Allan Poe house \u2013 As the university contemplated new construction to expand its law school, preservationists called for protection of 85 West [[Third Street (Manhattan)|Third Street]], where Poe lived from 1844 through early 1846. It is where he wrote \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\" and revised and published \"[[The Raven]]\". They asked the Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect the building, but it did not, so they also filed suit to save it. NYU officials said they did not consider the Poe house, or the Judson House on the same block (between Sullivan and [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]]s), important enough to save.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Siegal|first1=Nina|title=Rapping on Poe's Door, A Hint of Nevermore; Anger in Village Over N.Y.U.

On the site of the demolished St. Ann's Church on East 12th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, the university planned to build a dorm and solicited community input on its plans. The community asked that the 240-foot-tall building be scaled back, only to find in 2006 that construction plans were moving ahead to build a 26-story dormitory. That building, Founder's Hall, now towers over one preserved wall of the former St. Ann's Church, the gray stone fa\u00e7ade facing E. 12th Street.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Lincoln|title=Conceding nothing, N.Y.U. starts building megadorm|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_170/concedingnothingnyu.html|work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|accessdate=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820064150/http://thevillager.com/villager_170/concedingnothingnyu.html|archive-date=20 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Provincetown Playhouse and Apartments \u2013 Located at 133-139 MacDougal Street, this four-story complex hosted performances of works by playwrights from Edna St. Vincent Millay to Eugene O'Neill to Sam Shepard in its playhouse, while artists and others found shelter in the apartments above.

The center also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner & Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The Jack H. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts is a professionally operated and programmed 850-seat [[Proscenium|proscenium theater]]. Presentations there have included the Abbey Theater of Dublin's Playboy of the Western World, the world premiere of Mabou Mines Red Beads, a series of concerts by World Music Institute, and a series of superlative dance companies, including Lar Lubovitch and Bill T.

It is centrally located in the [[MetroTech Center]] and is close to transportation routes and easily accessible from all parts of New York City and Long Island. The Brooklyn campus offers programs for undergraduates students as well as for graduate students, including those executive programs for students with related experience.\n\nThe engineering school played a leadership role in bringing about MetroTech Center, one of the largest urban university-corporate parks in the world and the largest in the United States. Today, the 16-acre (65,000 m\u00b2), $1 billion complex is home to the institute and several technology-dependent companies, including Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC), New York City Police Department's 911 Center, New York City Fire Department Headquarters and the U.S. technology and operations functions of JPMorgan Chase. In 1998, a Marriott Hotel was built adjacent to MetroTech. MetroTech has proven to be a case study in effective university, corporate, government and private-developer cooperation. It has resulted in renewing an area that once was characterized more by urban decay.\n\nThe [[Wunsch Building]] which now houses the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development's Brooklyn Office, dates back to 1847 and was the first independent black church in Brooklyn. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad and has been designated a historic landmark since November 24, 1981.\n\nThe Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology, opened in 1990, is the engineering school's library.  In addition, wireless networks allow users with notebook computers to access the library's electronic services from anywhere on campus.\n\nThe Brooklyn campus also houses the [[Center for Urban Science and Progress]] as well as several of [[Tisch School of the Arts]]<ref name=\"animationcareerreview.com\">http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/top-50-game-design-schools-and-colleges-us-%E2%80%93-2015</ref> and [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]]'s degree programs.<ref>http://magnet.nyu.edu/</ref> The Brooklyn campus houses NYU's Game Center Open Library, which is the largest collection of games held by any university in the world.<ref name=\"animationcareerreview.com\"/> In 2014, [[NYU Langone Medical Center]] acquired a 125,000 square foot healthcare facility in Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Mary|title=NYU Langone to take over LICH emergency department in Brooklyn on Friday|url=http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2014/10/29/nyu-langone-take-over-lich-emergency-department-brooklyn-friday|website=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|accessdate=April 4, 2016|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDesign and engineering work for the full renovation and fit-out of [[370 Jay Street]] in Brooklyn is underway.

The campus hosts the Medical School, Tisch Hospital, and the [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Other NYU Centers across the city include NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and the Bellevue Hospital Center. NYU's Ehrenkranz School of Social Work manages branch campus programs in Westchester County at [[Manhattanville College]] and in [[Rockland County]] at [[St. Thomas Aquinas College]]. In Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York, NYU has a research facility that contains several institutes, in particular the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine.

The international houses have their own classroom space, libraries, offices, and often host campus events. The NYU international houses are:\n* [[Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2]]\n* [[La Maison Fran\u00e7aise (New York University)|La Maison Fran\u00e7aise]]\n* Deutsches Haus<ref>[http://deutscheshaus.as.nyu.edu/page/home Deutsches Haus]</ref>\n* Glucksman Ireland House<ref>[http://www.irelandhouse.fas.nyu.edu Glucksman Ireland House]</ref>\n* King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center\n* Hagop Kevorkian Center<ref>[http://neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu/page/home Hagop Kevorkian Center]</ref>\n* Africa House\n* China House\n\nNYU was also the founding member of the [[League of World Universities]].\n\n==Residence halls==\n[[File:NYU Founders Hall St. Ann's Church.jpg|thumb|right|Founder's Hall]]\n{{Main|NYU residence halls}}\nWith 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh largest university housing system in the U.S. and the largest among private schools.<ref>[http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html UM General Information<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305034155/http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html |date=2007-03-05 }}</ref> Uniquely, many of NYU residence halls are converted apartment complexes or old hotels. Most freshman residence halls are in the Washington Square area. While nearly all the upper classmen dorms are in the Union Square area, a few of them are as far as the [[Financial District, Manhattan]]. Until the Spring 2005 semester, NYU used a lottery system to determine eligibility for residence hall preference. Under this system, a student received one point for every semester they had lived in campus housing. Freshmen are freed from the lottery system and are by tradition placed in the halls closest to the main campus area. Therefore, historically, most of the students who lived in dorms found off-campus were sophomores. However, beginning in the fall 2006 semester, sophomores received priority housing, giving them first choice of residence halls. The purpose of this initiative was to keep the sophomore class together in the [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] area. As a result, the junior class (class of 2008) and the senior class (class of 2007) never benefited from first choice as sophomores or seniors. The university operates its own transit system to transport its students, by bus or trolley, to campus. Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU.\n\nTwenty-two buildings are in NYU's undergraduate housing system in the United States. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens and living rooms/common areas, one residence hall even has maid service. All residence halls are staffed by 24-hour security staff, contain multiple [[resident assistant]]s (RAs), and several halls contain faculty in residence. Unlike many other universities, NYU rooms all have their own bathrooms and thus no common bathrooms exist. Many residence halls have their own dining hall, and the university has meal choices to suit various diets. Almost all the residence halls have a [[laundry]] room that is open to resident students 24 hours a day.\n\nAll the residence halls are governed by the [[Residence hall association|Inter-Residence Hall Council]] (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization. Each hall elects student representatives to the IRHC, and those representatives meet with one another to form committees and vote on an executive board. The goal of this group is to create programs for university students and to act as a link to university administration.

Garment workers in factories responded to the movement by participating with the hashtag #IMadeYourClothes.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe movement began in [[England]] and spread through social media. On Twitter, 31.82% of the tweets with #WhoMadeMyClothes were posted by users from the United Kingdom. The top 5 countries with the highest search activity and Twitter posts for #WhoMadeMyClothes were the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, and France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hashtagify.me/hashtag/whomademyclothes|title=#whomademyclothes: Popularity, Trend, Related Hashtags|website=Hashtagify|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Celebrities including Emma Watson, Kelly Slater, and Fernanda Paes Leme used the hashtag on Twitter to support the issue.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fashionrevolution.org/2018-impact/|title=2018 Impact|website=Fashion Revolution|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe movement also utilized YouTube to spread awareness. To promote the hashtag in 2015, Fashion Revolution released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \"The 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\"|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, there was an increase in the general awareness of the reality behind the garment manufacturing processes. With increased awareness, global fashion brands have started to increase transparency. The 2018 Transparency Index allowed fashion brands the opportunity to change and justify their supply chains. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== Criticism ====\nDespite the public attention brought by Fashion Revolution, people remain skeptical of the movement\u2019s actions and consequences.

In an article by [[Women's Wear Daily|Women\u2019s Wear Daily]], the founder of Fashion Revolution responded to the criticisms by explaining how the index was not meant to be a way to audit the companies but rather a way to assess the accessibility of the information regarding the supply chain processes of their product to the customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/fashion-revolution-criticism-transparency-index-chanel-fendi-sustainability-10421031/|title=Fashion Revolution Responds to Criticism From Brands on Its Transparency Index|last=Theodosi|first=Natalie|last2=Theodosi|first2=Natalie|date=2016-04-29|website=WWD|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://fashionrevolution.org/ Fashion Revolution website]\n\n{{Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Fashion organizations]]\n[[Category:Clothing controversies]]\n[[Category:Workers' rights organizations]]\n[[Category:Business ethics organizations]]\n[[Category:Social responsibility organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{advert|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Who Made My Clothes Protest.jpg|thumb|Protestors hold \"Who Made My Clothes\" signs]]\n'''Fashion Revolution''' is a not-for-profit global movement with teams in over 100 countries around the world.

The index assesses the level of transparency and support for workers\u2019 rights of various fashion brands by looking at the information released by the company and by distributing various questionnaires. In an article by [[Women's Wear Daily|Women\u2019s Wear Daily]], the founder of Fashion Revolution responded to the criticisms by explaining how the index was not meant to be a way to audit the companies but rather a way to assess the accessibility of the information regarding the supply chain processes of their product to the customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/fashion-revolution-criticism-transparency-index-chanel-fendi-sustainability-10421031/|title=Fashion Revolution Responds to Criticism From Brands on Its Transparency Index|last=Theodosi|first=Natalie|last2=Theodosi|first2=Natalie|date=2016-04-29|website=WWD|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://fashionrevolution.org/ Fashion Revolution website]\n\n{{Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Fashion organizations]]\n[[Category:Clothing controversies]]\n[[Category:Workers' rights organizations]]\n[[Category:Business ethics organizations]]\n[[Category:Social responsibility organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in England]]\n", "name_user": "ArtsPatron1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Revolution"}
