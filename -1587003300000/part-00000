The school was established in 1962 when students from the city schools [[Christian Brothers College, Perth|CBC Perth]] and [[St Patrick's Boy School, Perth|St Patrick's Boys School]] moved to the new Trinity College campus.<ref name=History /><ref>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.accsport.asn.au/detailed-history/abridged-history\n    |title = Abridged History, Associated & Catholic Colleges (see St Patrick's School, a founding member)\n    |accessdate = 4 October 2012\n    |format = Website|publisher = Association of Catholic Colleges}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College is commonly shortened to '''Trinity''' or '''TC'''. Former students of Trinity are called Trinity Old Boys. Trinity is a school in the [[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]] tradition promoting classic and modern education, culture, dance, drama, music, service to others, spirituality, sport, and vocation.<ref name=AISWA>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.ais.wa.edu.au/search-school/?&mode=details&id=111\n    |title = Trinity College\n    |accessdate = 26 December 2007\n    |work = Search for School\n    |publisher = Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia}}</ref> Trinity comprises an East Perth campus with a junior school for years 4 to 6, a middle school for years 7 to 8, and a senior school for years 9 to 12; an outdoor education wilderness at Camp Kelly [[Dwellingup, Western Australia|Dwellingup]]; and sporting grounds at [[Waterford, Western Australia|Waterford]].\n\n==CBC Perth and St Patrick's Boys School==\n[[File:CBC Perth, St Georges Tce - (improved contrast).tif|237px|thumb|right|CBC Perth, St Georges Tce, Est.1894]]\n[[File:Trinity College Perth - Main Gates (improved contrast cropped).tif|237px|thumb|right|Trinity College Perth, Centenary Gates]]\n\nCBC Perth was founded in 1894 by Bishop [[Matthew Gibney]], Brother [[Ambrose Treacy]], and the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]].<ref name=History/> The college was the second high school built in Western Australia. It was located in the heart of [[Perth]] on the corner of [[Victoria Avenue, Perth|Victoria Avenue]] and [[St Georges Terrace]].\n\nIn 1938, the boarding school and some day boys moved to the new school at [[Aquinas College, Perth|Aquinas College]], Salter Point. Aquinas inherited the school colours red and black, the school crest and motto, the honour boards, and the school PSA membership and achievements. The new campus at Aquinas depleted student numbers at CBC Perth. Nearby, St Patrick's, a Christian Brothers school in the city on the corner of Wellington and Lord Streets, was overflowing. Many students transferred from St Patrick's, and CBC Perth continued as a day school from 1938. Stripped of its history, traditions and students, CBC Perth raised new honour boards and the colours blue, light blue and green, and the college set about claiming a new heritage which 24 years later would become Trinity College.\n\nWhen Perth won the right to host the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], the [[City of Perth]] negotiated with the Christian Brothers from 1958-1960 to purchase CBC Perth for \u00a3267,000, in order to widen St Georges Terrace and to construct a new hotel.<ref name=History/> The Chevron-Hilton Hotel Group which had committed to the development, ran into difficulties, and the school buildings remained until demolition in the mid-1960s. The site was vacant until the [[Australian Taxation Office]] building was built there several years later. The building is now the Duxton Hotel. The council provided a {{convert|5.7|ha|acre|0|sing=on}} site for the new college on reclaimed land in [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] on the banks of the Swan River, next to the [[WACA Ground]], [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]], and [[The Causeway]].<ref name=History/>\n\nBrother J.A.Kelly, headmaster of CBC Perth, and architect Jim Henderson fast tracked construction of Trinity College from 1960 to ensure the college opened in time for the 1962 school year. Even with the pressing deadline, Brother Kelly was instrumental in building the imaginative round chapel at Trinity, and he commissioned Ted Gowers to design the stained glass windows set in concrete.<ref name=TCNews>Trinity News Summer 2012, General - Vale to a Man of Glass p21, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref> At the time, this was the largest work of art undertaken in the post-war years of Western Australia.<ref name=TCNews/> Brother Kelly also commissioned artist Margaret Priest to design and make abstract statues of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Crucifix]], and the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]].<ref>Trinity News Summer 2012, Archives - The Trinity College Madonna and Child Statue p37, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1961, Trinity College was nearing completion. CBC Perth closed and when St Patrick's closed two years later the two schools became one.<ref>Trinity News Summer 2013, Archives - St Patrick's Celtic Cross p38, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 25 December 2013</ref>\n\n==Trinity==\nIn 1962, Trinity opened as a day school with 830 boys. The official opening was held on 25 March 1962.<ref name=History/> The school had a new crest and motto, and retained the colours and the honour boards of CBC Perth which were raised in 1938. Trinity dominated Association Catholic Colleges sporting events. In 1968, Trinity joined the [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] and the manful rivalry with Aquinas, ''the old foe'', entered a level playing field. In 1972, Trinity won the PSA athletics carnival ending a seven-year winning streak by Aquinas. In the years ahead, coaches and students at Aquinas responded with the call, \"Beat Trinity!\"\n\n===Campus===\nThe college has undergone significant expansion. The original 1962 buildings included Trinity Chapel, A and B blocks, Gibney Hall, the pavilion, a squash and handball court (both demolished late 1999), and the Brothers Monastery (rebuilt into the Junior School in 1991). In 1983, Gibney Hall was widened, by bricking-in the balcony on the western side, and lengthened to accommodate all students and staff at assemblies. Over the years the college has expanded to include Kelly Senior School 1968, Duffy Library 1979, admin block 1981, Foley Physical Education Centre 1992, Treacy Design and Technology Centre 2001, Brockwell Observatory 2001, Curtis Aquatic Centre 2004, and O'Doherty Cultural Education Centre 2010.  In addition to the East Perth campus, the school has Camp Kelly, an outdoor education facility situated 8&nbsp;km south of Dwellingup, and {{convert|10|ha|m2}} of sports ground at Waterford.\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College - View from the Oval.tif|1024px|View from the oval||none}}\n\n===Principals===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brother JA Kelly, Headmaster Trinity College Perth 1962.tif|60px|thumb|left|Br Kelly, 1962]] -->\n\nBrother Kelly was the last headmaster of CBC Perth and the founding headmaster of Trinity College. He was headmaster during 1962-1966 and he returned again as headmaster during 1978-1984. Four Christian Brothers served as headmaster of the college. Over the years, [[Laity|lay]] teachers gradually replaced Christian Brothers on staff. In 1994, Anthony Curtis was appointed the first lay principal (name changed from headmaster to principal).

It is compulsory for each student to compete in a summer and a winter sport. PSA sports take precedence over sports outside the college. Other than for health reasons, a student may only be exempted from training, matches, or both if the student is selected to train or play at a national or international level when it clashes with college training or PSA competition. The college does not encourage students to try out for higher representative levels if it conflicts with the college PSA sporting schedule. In football, Trinity students typically do not compete for selection for the [[Western Australian Football League]] colts or for Teal Cup teams. This does not hamper future selection opportunities for students. Many students have been selected in the [[Australian Football League]] national draft based on their performance in the PSA. The sporting skills, coaching, fitness and organisation of students from the seven PSA schools is commensurable to the highest levels offered by any schoolboy competition in Western Australia. This is evident by the number of former PSA students who compete in their chosen sports at state, national, international, and Olympic levels.\n\nAs the most recent school in the PSA, Trinity has improved over time and the college has moved up the ranks in most sports. The most notable exception is swimming.\n\nThe main campus at East Perth has one oval which prior to the EPRA land-swap catered for a turf cricket ground in summer, a football oval in winter, and an athletics training track in spring. There are four outdoor [[hardcourts]] marked for tennis and basketball. The campus has a 50m swimming pool and a gymnasium which is marked with basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts. As well, the school has a rowing boathouse on the East Perth foreshore. Courses along [[Heirisson Island]], the Swan River foreshore, and [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] including [[Kings Park, Western Australia#Jacob's Ladder|Jacobs Ladder]] provide excellent cross-country tracks. The East Perth campus lacks dedicated facilities for hockey, rugby and soccer. At various times the college has sought to purchase the land between the college and the Causeway, as well as vacant land on the north side of Gloucester Park. Negotiations for these purchases with the City of Perth have repeatedly fallen through due to town planning intentions. However, the City of Perth has allowed the college to use facilities at Haig Park, which has now been redeveloped by EPRA, and to use facilities at [[Langley Park (Western Australia)|Langley Park]] and [[Wellington Square, Perth|Wellington Square]].\n\nThe Waterford playing fields have five cricket ovals, three turfed and two synthetic pitches. Two turfed pitch ovals become football ovals in winter and the remaining pitches separate into two soccer fields, two hockey fields and one rugby field.\n\nThe senior school holds official college trials and championships for swimming and athletics. Students who advance from the trials compete against each other in the college championships to decide school champions and to decide who qualifies for events on the school teams. Summer and winter team sports hold similar selection procedures relevant to the criteria set-down by each code. College champions for summer and winter team sports are chosen by judging committees who award points for a player's performance for each official PSA fixture. In addition, the college has three major sports awards. The J P Ilich Award for outstanding service to the school in sport, and the Old Boys Awards for the students who score the most points for Trinity at PSA athletics and swimming carnivals.\n\n===School houses===\nTrinity inherited a four [[house system]] from CBC Perth. Each house has a major and a minor colour, a motto and an emblem. Each classroom stream is divided into one of the four houses. Siblings and cousins belong to the house of their eldest relative. When played, competitions are held to decide the House Champion. Currently, the house system is the format for carnival competitions held within the junior school.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Two carnivals, swimming and athletics, are called the Bowers, and the third carnival, cross-country, is called the Sevens. Teams are the same as the home-room class. In the lead up to the swimming and athletics carnivals, each home-room class holds an impromptu meeting to decide the Jack (class captain) and the Dealer (class selector). The tactics of the Dealer are the key to winning a Bowers carnival. Each student must compete in one of the race divisions for each event and the line-ups must be submitted before a Bowers carnival begins. Each race division awards the same points descending from first to last. Calculations using intelligence gathering and misinformation are required to work out the best order to race classmates. One important play is the Jack who is awarded maximum points regardless of where he finishes in a race. Cheating is a permitted tactic. A cheat stands and points awarded if no appeal is made to the carnival judge before the end of a race. If an appeal for cheating is upheld, the cheater forfeits points earned from the race. The winning team is the class which out-trumps the other classes by setting up the most favourable mis-matches in order to score the most points. The cross-country carnival, called the Sevens, is pure in format. No cheats are permitted and the carnival judge may order a cheater to wear a smock-of-shame for a day. The winning team is the first to have seven classmates cross the finishing line. However, there is one important exception. The team with the last seven to cross the finishing line automatically loses. The carnivals may be used for fundraising and nominal wagers by each competitor are put into a kitty. The winning team for each carnival is awarded the right to choose an approved cause to donate the kitty.\n\n===School hymn===\nThe title of the school hymn, \"[[In nomine Domini|In Nomine Domini]]\", is derived from the school motto and [[Psalm]] 123: ''adjutorium nostrum in Nomine Domini,'' \"Our help is in the name of the Lord.\" The hymn was written in 1979 by Father Paul Keyte, the school chaplain at the time. Inspired by the Harrow School Song \"Forty Years On\", Father Keyte wrote in the 1979 School Annual, he was not merely trying to write a hymn but an anthem and something that, \"would not only renew loyalty to the school but would also rekindle the flame of faith\". The music was written by Brother Gerald Crooks, a long serving music teacher at the College. In 1984, Brother Crooks introduced a brass fanfare lead featuring trumpets and trombones. \"In Nomine Domine\" is sung at Speech Nights, Year 12 Graduations, [[ANZAC Day]] ceremonies, and at PSA sporting events.\n\n==International achievements==\n'''International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2016'''\n\nThe team from Trinity won the Meritous Award - the second highest award category - at the [[International Mathematical Modeling Challenge|International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IM<sup>2</sup>C)]].

boys, located on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] foreshore in [[East Perth, Western Australia]]. The school was established in 1962 when students from the city schools [[Christian Brothers College, Perth|CBC Perth]] and [[St Patrick's Boy School, Perth|St Patrick's Boys School]] moved to the new Trinity College campus.<ref name=History /><ref>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.accsport.asn.au/detailed-history/abridged-history\n    |title = Abridged History, Associated & Catholic Colleges (see St Patrick's School, a founding member)\n    |accessdate = 4 October 2012\n    |format = Website|publisher = Association of Catholic Colleges}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College is commonly shortened to '''Trinity''' or '''TC'''. Former students of Trinity are called Trinity Old Boys. Trinity is a school in the [[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]] tradition promoting classic and modern education, culture, dance, drama, music, service to others, spirituality, sport, and vocation.<ref name=AISWA>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.ais.wa.edu.au/search-school/?&mode=details&id=111\n    |title = Trinity College\n    |accessdate = 26 December 2007\n    |work = Search for School\n    |publisher = Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia}}</ref> Trinity comprises an East Perth campus with a junior school for years 4 to 6, a middle school for years 7 to 8, and a senior school for years 9 to 12; an outdoor education wilderness at Camp Kelly [[Dwellingup, Western Australia|Dwellingup]]; and sporting grounds at [[Waterford, Western Australia|Waterford]].\n\n==CBC Perth and St Patrick's Boys School==\n[[File:CBC Perth, St Georges Tce - (improved contrast).tif|237px|thumb|right|CBC Perth, St Georges Tce, Est.1894]]\n[[File:Trinity College Perth - Main Gates (improved contrast cropped).tif|237px|thumb|right|Trinity College Perth, Centenary Gates]]\n\nCBC Perth was founded in 1894 by Bishop [[Matthew Gibney]], Brother [[Ambrose Treacy]], and the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]].<ref name=History/> The college was the second high school built in Western Australia. It was located in the heart of [[Perth]] on the corner of [[Victoria Avenue, Perth|Victoria Avenue]] and [[St Georges Terrace]].\n\nIn 1938, the boarding school and some day boys moved to the new school at [[Aquinas College, Perth|Aquinas College]], Salter Point. Aquinas inherited the school colours red and black, the school crest and motto, the honour boards, and the school PSA membership and achievements. The new campus at Aquinas depleted student numbers at CBC Perth. Nearby, St Patrick's, a Christian Brothers school in the city on the corner of Wellington and Lord Streets, was overflowing. Many students transferred from St Patrick's, and CBC Perth continued as a day school from 1938. Stripped of its history, traditions and students, CBC Perth raised new honour boards and the colours blue, light blue and green, and the college set about claiming a new heritage which 24 years later would become Trinity College.\n\nWhen Perth won the right to host the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], the [[City of Perth]] negotiated with the Christian Brothers from 1958-1960 to purchase CBC Perth for \u00a3267,000, in order to widen St Georges Terrace and to construct a new hotel.<ref name=History/> The Chevron-Hilton Hotel Group which had committed to the development, ran into difficulties, and the school buildings remained until demolition in the mid-1960s. The site was vacant until the [[Australian Taxation Office]] building was built there several years later. The building is now the Duxton Hotel. The council provided a {{convert|5.7|ha|acre|0|sing=on}} site for the new college on reclaimed land in [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] on the banks of the Swan River, next to the [[WACA Ground]], [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]], and [[The Causeway]].<ref name=History/>\n\nBrother J.A.Kelly, headmaster of CBC Perth, and architect Jim Henderson fast tracked construction of Trinity College from 1960 to ensure the college opened in time for the 1962 school year. Even with the pressing deadline, Brother Kelly was instrumental in building the imaginative round chapel at Trinity, and he commissioned Ted Gowers to design the stained glass windows set in concrete.<ref name=TCNews>Trinity News Summer 2012, General - Vale to a Man of Glass p21, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref> At the time, this was the largest work of art undertaken in the post-war years of Western Australia.<ref name=TCNews/> Brother Kelly also commissioned artist Margaret Priest to design and make abstract statues of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Crucifix]], and the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]].<ref>Trinity News Summer 2012, Archives - The Trinity College Madonna and Child Statue p37, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1961, Trinity College was nearing completion. CBC Perth closed and when St Patrick's closed two years later the two schools became one.<ref>Trinity News Summer 2013, Archives - St Patrick's Celtic Cross p38, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 25 December 2013</ref>\n\n==Trinity==\nIn 1962, Trinity opened as a day school with 830 boys. The official opening was held on 25 March 1962.<ref name=History/> The school had a new crest and motto, and retained the colours and the honour boards of CBC Perth which were raised in 1938. Trinity dominated Association Catholic Colleges sporting events. In 1968, Trinity joined the [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] and the manful rivalry with Aquinas, ''the old foe'', entered a level playing field. In 1972, Trinity won the PSA athletics carnival ending a seven-year winning streak by Aquinas. In the years ahead, coaches and students at Aquinas responded with the call, \"Beat Trinity!\"\n\n===Campus===\nThe college has undergone significant expansion. The original 1962 buildings included Trinity Chapel, A and B blocks, Gibney Hall, the pavilion, a squash and handball court (both demolished late 1999), and the Brothers Monastery (rebuilt into the Junior School in 1991). In 1983, Gibney Hall was widened, by bricking-in the balcony on the western side, and lengthened to accommodate all students and staff at assemblies. Over the years the college has expanded to include Kelly Senior School 1968, Duffy Library 1979, admin block 1981, Foley Physical Education Centre 1992, Treacy Design and Technology Centre 2001, Brockwell Observatory 2001, Curtis Aquatic Centre 2004, and O'Doherty Cultural Education Centre 2010.  In addition to the East Perth campus, the school has Camp Kelly, an outdoor education facility situated 8&nbsp;km south of Dwellingup, and {{convert|10|ha|m2}} of sports ground at Waterford.\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College - View from the Oval.tif|1024px|View from the oval||none}}\n\n===Principals===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brother JA Kelly, Headmaster Trinity College Perth 1962.tif|60px|thumb|left|Br Kelly, 1962]] -->\n\nBrother Kelly was the last headmaster of CBC Perth and the founding headmaster of Trinity College.

It is compulsory for each student to compete in a summer and a winter sport. PSA sports take precedence over sports outside the college. Other than for health reasons, a student may only be exempted from training, matches, or both if the student is selected to train or play at a national or international level when it clashes with college training or PSA competition. The college does not encourage students to try out for higher representative levels if it conflicts with the college PSA sporting schedule. In football, Trinity students typically do not compete for selection for the [[Western Australian Football League]] colts or for Teal Cup teams. This does not hamper future selection opportunities for students. Many students have been selected in the [[Australian Football League]] national draft based on their performance in the PSA. The sporting skills, coaching, fitness and organisation of students from the seven PSA schools is commensurable to the highest levels offered by any schoolboy competition in Western Australia. This is evident by the number of former PSA students who compete in their chosen sports at state, national, international, and Olympic levels.\n\nAs the most recent school in the PSA, Trinity has improved over time and the college has moved up the ranks in most sports. The most notable exception is swimming.\n\nThe main campus at East Perth has one oval which prior to the EPRA land-swap catered for a turf cricket ground in summer, a football oval in winter, and an athletics training track in spring. There are four outdoor [[hardcourts]] marked for tennis and basketball. The campus has a 50m swimming pool and a gymnasium which is marked with basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts. As well, the school has a rowing boathouse on the East Perth foreshore. Courses along [[Heirisson Island]], the Swan River foreshore, and [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] including [[Kings Park, Western Australia#Jacob's Ladder|Jacobs Ladder]] provide excellent cross-country tracks. The East Perth campus lacks dedicated facilities for hockey, rugby and soccer. At various times the college has sought to purchase the land between the college and the Causeway, as well as vacant land on the north side of Gloucester Park. Negotiations for these purchases with the City of Perth have repeatedly fallen through due to town planning intentions. However, the City of Perth has allowed the college to use facilities at Haig Park, which has now been redeveloped by EPRA, and to use facilities at [[Langley Park (Western Australia)|Langley Park]] and [[Wellington Square, Perth|Wellington Square]].\n\nThe Waterford playing fields have five cricket ovals, three turfed and two synthetic pitches. Two turfed pitch ovals become football ovals in winter and the remaining pitches separate into two soccer fields, two hockey fields and one rugby field.\n\nThe senior school holds official college trials and championships for swimming and athletics. Students who advance from the trials compete against each other in the college championships to decide school champions and to decide who qualifies for events on the school teams. Summer and winter team sports hold similar selection procedures relevant to the criteria set-down by each code. College champions for summer and winter team sports are chosen by judging committees who award points for a player's performance for each official PSA fixture. In addition, the college has three major sports awards. The J P Ilich Award for outstanding service to the school in sport, and the Old Boys Awards for the students who score the most points for Trinity at PSA athletics and swimming carnivals.\n\n===School houses===\nTrinity inherited a four [[house system]] from CBC Perth. Each house has a major and a minor colour, a motto and an emblem. Each classroom stream is divided into one of the four houses. Siblings and cousins belong to the house of their eldest relative. When played, competitions are held to decide the House Champion. Currently, the house system is the format for carnival competitions held within the junior school.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Two carnivals, swimming and athletics, are called the Bowers, and the third carnival, cross-country, is called the Sevens. Teams are the same as the home-room class. In the lead up to the swimming and athletics carnivals, each home-room class holds an impromptu meeting to decide the Jack (class captain) and the Dealer (class selector). The tactics of the Dealer are the key to winning a Bowers carnival. Each student must compete in one of the race divisions for each event and the line-ups must be submitted before a Bowers carnival begins. Each race division awards the same points descending from first to last. Calculations using intelligence gathering and misinformation are required to work out the best order to race classmates. One important play is the Jack who is awarded maximum points regardless of where he finishes in a race. Cheating is a permitted tactic. A cheat stands and points awarded if no appeal is made to the carnival judge before the end of a race. If an appeal for cheating is upheld, the cheater forfeits points earned from the race. The winning team is the class which out-trumps the other classes by setting up the most favourable mis-matches in order to score the most points. The cross-country carnival, called the Sevens, is pure in format. No cheats are permitted and the carnival judge may order a cheater to wear a smock-of-shame for a day. The winning team is the first to have seven classmates cross the finishing line. However, there is one important exception. The team with the last seven to cross the finishing line automatically loses. The carnivals may be used for fundraising and nominal wagers by each competitor are put into a kitty. The winning team for each carnival is awarded the right to choose an approved cause to donate the kitty.\n\n===School hymn===\nThe title of the school hymn, \"[[In nomine Domini|In Nomine Domini]]\", is derived from the school motto and [[Psalm]] 123: ''adjutorium nostrum in Nomine Domini,'' \"Our help is in the name of the Lord.\" The hymn was written in 1979 by Father Paul Keyte, the school chaplain at the time. Inspired by the Harrow School Song \"Forty Years On\", Father Keyte wrote in the 1979 School Annual, he was not merely trying to write a hymn but an anthem and something that, \"would not only renew loyalty to the school but would also rekindle the flame of faith\". The music was written by Brother Gerald Crooks, a long serving music teacher at the College. In 1984, Brother Crooks introduced a brass fanfare lead featuring trumpets and trombones. \"In Nomine Domine\" is sung at Speech Nights, Year 12 Graduations, [[ANZAC Day]] ceremonies, and at PSA sporting events.\n\n==International achievements==\n'''International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2016'''\n\nThe team from Trinity won the Meritous Award - the second highest award category - at the [[International Mathematical Modeling Challenge|International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IM<sup>2</sup>C)]].

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by French [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered, these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been {{convert|8.5 and 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unusually among all other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and ischia being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014like in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos. These bones were recovered from a [[red sandstone]] layer, within a surface area of less than {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} squared. Designated under the specimen number MDS BK10-01 \u2014 15, it consists of a partly [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#articulation|articulated]], well preserved skeleton lacking the skull and limbs, and including the third to last [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dorsals|dorsal]] (back) [[vertebra]], the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#neural spine|neural spine]] of the last dorsal vertebra, five partial [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#sacrals|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae, the first two [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#caudals|caudal]] (tail) vertebrae, both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ilium|ilia]] (main hip bone), a right [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubis]] (pubic bone), both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischium|ischia]] (lower and rearmost hip bones) and a posterior dorsal [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ribs|rib]]. The twelfth dorsal spine is bent sideways when viewed front-to-back due to [[Taphonomy|taphonomic]] distorsion, and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#centrum|centra]] (bodies of the vertebrae) of the sacrals are largely incomplete due to erosion, but preserved all their accompanying spines with their upper edges intact.

The first dorsal vertebra had extensive [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#transverse processes|transverse processes]] (wing-like projections that articulate with the ribs), as well as deep air pockets at the front and back of its base. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#parapophyses|parapophysis]] (a process that articulated with the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#capitulum|capitulum]] of the ribs) of the first dorsal increased in height from the top and bottom, with its underside remaining in contact with the front lower edge of the centrum, this is unlike the condition in most theropods, where the parapophyses shifted towards the top of the vertebra during the transition from cervical to dorsal vertebrae. All of these features were also present in the African spinosaurid ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''.

The rib shaft was strongly curved, forming a half circle. The lower end of the rib was slightly expanded both sideways and to the front and back. This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis had L-shape, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches. The ischium was {{Convert|49.6|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, making it shorter in relation to the pubis than in all other known [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods. Its main body was large and extensive, atypical of the Y-shaped upper ischia of other tetanurans, and bore an oval-shaped obturator foramen in its side. The shaft of the ischium was flattened sideways, and had an unexpanded [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischiadic apron|ischiadic apron]] (as in ''[[Monolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Sinraptor]]'').<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> The ischium attached to the illium via a peg-and-socket-like articulation, unlike the flat and concave condition seen in ''Baryonyx''.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped [[Process (anatomy)|process]] on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being comparatively shorter to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]], the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by French [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered, these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been {{convert|8.5 and 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unusually among all other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and ischia being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014like in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos.

The rib shaft was strongly curved, forming a half circle. The lower end of the rib was slightly expanded both sideways and to the front and back. This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa.

The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches. The ischium was {{Convert|49.6|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, making it shorter in relation to the pubis than in all other known [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped [[Process (anatomy)|process]] on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being comparatively shorter to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]], the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

''Vandegrift'' reached the area on 5 April, and at about 0800 the following morning, she lowered a team in a [[rigid hull inflatable boat]] (RHIB), and the sailors brought the family and the pararescuemen on board the frigate. The rescuers provided the Kauffmans with food, water, and medical assistance, but instructed the castaways that because of the limited room on board the RHIB and ship, they could only retrieve three bags of their personal belongings in a single trip before ''Vandegrift'' sank ''Rebel Heart'' as a hazard to navigation.

''Vandegrift'' reached the area on 5 April, and at about 0800 the following morning, she lowered a team in a [[rigid hull inflatable boat]] (RHIB), and the sailors brought the family and the pararescuemen on board the frigate. The rescuers provided the Kauffmans with food, water, and medical assistance, but instructed the castaways that because of the limited room on board the RHIB and ship, they could only retrieve three bags of their personal belongings in a single trip before ''Vandegrift'' sank ''Rebel Heart'' as a hazard to navigation.

South of New York City, the trains are restricted to {{cvt|135|mph}}. By comparison, the ''Northeast Regional'' and the now-defunct [[Metroliner (train)|''Metroliner'']] service reached {{cvt|125|mph}}.\n\n''Acela'' service was originally expected to begin in late 1999 but was delayed. The catenary system could not support the intended speeds between Washington DC and New York City, but the newer system between New York City and Boston allows the higher speeds. Attention was drawn to the decreased 4.2\u00b0 tilt, but this was not the root of the speed problem, as the tracks from New York to Boston are similar to those between New York and Washington, and the tilt mechanism is not the factor enabling higher speeds.<ref name=\"bedevils\" /><ref name=\"TGVweb\" /> Following repairs, the first ''Acela'' service began on December 11, 2000, a year behind schedule.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/11/acela_departs.htm |title=Fast train begins service with Washington-Boston roundtrip |last=Laurence Arnold |date=December 11, 2001 |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=November 13, 2006 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n''Acela'' travels between Boston and New York in about three and a half hours (an improvement of half an hour); New York to Washington runs take a minimum two hours and forty-five minutes.<ref name=\"bos-was\" /> These schedules, as well as the relative convenience of direct downtown-to-downtown rail service as opposed to air travel, especially after the [[September 11 attacks]], have made the ''Acela Express'' more competitive with the [[air shuttle]]s.

The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nStiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the ''[[femme fatale]]''. They are often considered to be a seductive item of clothing, and often feature in popular culture in this context.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Advantages==\nWhile wearing high heels undoubtedly makes your legs look amazing, we bet you never thought that they might also bring health benefits. But actually they can; and while wearing flats might give your feet a break from being elevated, they don\u2019t bring all of the health benefits that high heels can offer. These can be both physical and mental so let\u2019s look at a few and discover why wearing heels from time to time could be the healthy option as well as the stylish one.\n\nLOOKING AND FEELING TALLER\nOne of the most obvious benefits of high heels is that they allow you to look and feel taller. You simply can\u2019t get this benefit if you\u2019re wearing flats. While this might be okay if you meet the average 5 ft 8 height or if you\u2019re even in model height territory, many women say that it can be irritating and awkward if you are just over five feet tall. For women who are shorter, it can feel like people either constantly overlook you, or sometimes literally or ignore you completely. This can result in a knock on your confidence. Wearing heels will change the game completely and allow you to feel empowered which can be beneficial for mental health. You suddenly won\u2019t feel less than the 6ft friend you\u2019ve been standing next to all evening.\n\nWORKING THOSE LEG MUSCLES\nAs well as making you look taller, heels can actually benefit the muscles in your legs leading to more muscle and less fat in the calves. This will typically depend on the height of the heels that you choose to wear, but they can certainly have an impact here. Walking, you might even notice that your calves tighten to compensate for the pressure on your legs. After a few months wearing heels, you\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s more muscle in your calves and they will no doubt look fantastic too! \n\nSLIMMER PHYSIQUE\nInterestingly, when you wear heels, it can actually impact your entire physique and your posture. The heels cause your entire body to respond, arching the back. The chest is pushed out while the buttocks  stick out leading to the appearance of a slimmer physique. It can even cause you to lose weight and might do more good than the dieting trend you have been trying recently.\n\nThe Future of Fashion\n\nBOOSTING YOUR CONFIDENCE\nConfidence is always going to be important to your health. People who lack in confidence often struggle in daily life whether at work or in their personal life. Confidence is important whether you are out on a date or attending an office meeting and the right set of heels can give you the level of confidence that you need for both. This is once again tied to how heels change how your body looks and of course, your height. When we are taller or elevated, we naturally feel more authoritative and as such are better equipped mentally to deal with issues that are stressful or put us under pressure. The right heels could be key for winning that next important client contract.\n\nAVOID LATER DAMAGE\nAs we get older, both women and men do tend to develop issues with their joints, bones and muscles. However, wearing heels on and off could help reduce the chances of you developing this issue according to recent research. Studies show that wearing heels strengthens the ankle joints and muscles and as such, reduces the chance of women developing arthritis here when they age. Women do tend to have more issues with their legs than men as they age and it was long suspected that heels were the cause of the issue. Now, it seems that is not the case.\n\nNO NEED FOR EXERCISE\nWell, a certain type of exercise at least. A researcher in Italy fuelled by her love of high heels was determined to find a health benefit for wearing the sexy, elegant footwear and she found one. Women who wore heels regularly showed fifteen percent less electrical activity through their pelvic muscles. The pelvic muscle is actually linked to sexual activity, so it could, theoretically suggest that women who wear heels could enjoy sexual activity far more without the need of exercising their pelvis.\n\nIt seems then that there are a number of benefits for wearing high heeled shoes, both mental and physical. It\u2019s important to understand that flat shoes also provide health benefits and may even be more comfortable after long periods. But they simply do not provide women with some of these unique and fascinating advantages.\n\nHeels make our walk more attractive\nShutterstock\nPsychologist Paul Morris and his colleagues did an experiment to test what heels do for a woman's attractiveness. They recorded females walking in flat shoes, and then again in high heels. Like any good experiment, they needed a way to isolate the effects so that other factors didn't muddy the results. So one by one, they decorated 12 different women of varying ages and sizes with glow in the dark dots at specific points along their body. They then had them walk a treadmill in complete darkness so that only their glowing dots were visible \u2013 one time dressed in 2 1/2-inch heels, the other, dressed in flats.\n\n\nThe observers couldn't see the women \u2013 their age, their weight or their face. They could just see the way they moved when they walked. What happens when you rate a woman on her heel-walking alone? Apparently, a change in gait. With heels, there is a reduced stride, and increased rotation and tilt of the hips. In other words, she struts.\n\nWithout any of the other usual indicators of attractiveness, this change in gait alone made the study participants find the heeled-females more attractive.\n\nThey make us appear more feminine\nShutterstock\nMorris and his colleagues decided to take it a step further. They altered the experiment, showing the same videos of the women treadmill-walking in darkness to a new group of participants. But this time, they asked the participants to identify which subjects were females, and which were males. The key to remember here is, all of the walkers were still female.\n\n\nWith every \"male\" guess, the participant had mistaken a woman in flats for a man. Nothing ground-breaking here, but it confirms scientifically what we already assumed. Heels are girly, ladylike, and feminine.\n\nCertified image consultant, personal stylist and confidence coach, Laurie Brucker, agrees. The subject of \"to heel or not to heel?\" often comes up with her clients. Her answer? She is an advocate for them because they make you strut.\n\n\"When a woman walks in heels, fluid strut is required which forces women to move their hips!\" Brucker says. \"By moving their hips, whether a subtle strut or an exaggerated cat walk, it reminds women that they are women!\"\n\nHeels are office dress code\nShutterstock\nImagine going into work one day, confident in your chinos and ballet flats, only to be asked by your employer to leave and come back with heels \u2014 or just leave.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Nicole Thorp. Her employer, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, told her she had to wear shoes with a 2-4-inch heel. Thorp refused their demands and was sent home without pay. Although legal and within the company's rights, she took it upon herself to change that and started a petition. It called on the people to make it illegal for a company to require a woman to wear heels to work.\n\n\nThe petition has received over 150,000 signatures and a whole lot of attention from the press and social media, becoming something of a movement. Or at the very least, a hashtag. Type #myheelsmychoice into Twitter to find people all over the world standing flat-footed in solidarity with Thorp \u2014 from outraged women sharing similar experiences, to a Swedish handyman who wore bright pink stilettos on the job to prove a not-so-subtle point.\n\n\"There's a history behind heels and the damage that it can do to women,\" Thorp says in an online video interview. \"And there's a sexualized element to it, as opposed to a shirt and tie for a man.\"\n\nThey're culturally-ingrained\nShutterstock\nFashion journalist and style icon, NJ Goldston, lives in a place where the choice isn't heels or flats. It's sling backs or stilettos. Los Angeles. Tinseltown, La La Land. Where heels are considered the style de rigueur, an entry point into a mutual admiration society.\n\n\nIn her world, your car doubles as a moving closet. \"No matter your social circle or neighborhood (except maybe the beach communities), heels are the LA way to amp up a more casual look on the fly when there is no way to go home and dress up after a long work day,\" Goldston says.\n\nShe admits, the LA culture is embracing a more fashion-athletic look. She recently overdressed for a Sunday brunch in Malibu where more casual footwear may have been more acceptable. But that's the exception, not the rule. \"LA is such an event-driven town that flats are not really the way to go when you are attending a major luncheon or party.\"\n\nPopular culture told you to\nShutterstock\nLook through a rack of women's fashion and lifestyle magazines, and you'll most likely find cover models posing in designer pumps and at least one publication peddling, \"Heels that make heads turn.\"\n\nAn article in Glamour touts the many benefits of wearing heels, saying, \"Your calf muscles, no matter how weak, look instantly better when you slip on your favorite pumps.\" Even movies show women wearing heels in impractical situations.\n\n\nWe all know that heels are red carpet staples. From Blake Lively who reportedly told People Magazine that nothing is as \"relaxing\" as a great pair of Louboutins, to the petite Ariana Grande who almost always seems to be wearing knee high boots with long spiky points. And who could forget the queen of heels herself \u2014 Carrie Bradshaw \u2014 who was always found pounding the New York pavement in her beloved Blahniks, Choos or Louboutins.\n\nHer former show, Sex and the City, spells out women's love for heels in one quote many fans remember, \"The fact is, sometimes it's hard to walk in a single woman's shoes. That's why we need really special ones now and then \u2014 to make the walk a little more fun.\"\n\n\nIt's hard to argue with logic like that.\n\nHeels get you more male attention\nShutterstock\nResearcher and professor, Nicolas Gueguen, conducted a series of experiments using 19-year-old-women in tight tops and heels or flats. He started out with the old fashioned \"I dropped my glove\" routine, in which he found it was picked up and returned 60 percent of the time when the women wore flats, and 95 percent of the time when she wore heels.\n\n\nHe also timed how long it would take a man to approach a woman sitting at a bar. The women with flats got approached within 14 minutes. Not bad. Except once the flats came off and the heels were strapped on, that time got cut in half. Pickup lines were happening within seven minutes. Impressive.\n\nHeels help you be more persuasive\nShutterstock\nIn another experiment, Gueguen took the women to the streets. No, not like that.\n\nHe had them stop pedestrians to answer a survey about gender equality. The study found that 40 percent of men would respond to a women wearing flats, 60 percent to women in medium heels, and 80 percent of men were all ears when the women were wearing high heels.\u00a0Hmmm. Could this be applicable to court cases? Business pitches? Or maybe even convincing husbands to wash the dishes?\n\n\nThey symbolize power\nShutterstock\nOne of the first accounts of people wearing heels dates back to 3500 BC. Aristocratic men and women wore them for ceremonial purposes. It has been said the added height set themselves apart \u2014 or above \u2014 from the social classes. Aristocracy, perhaps, doesn't apply in today's world. But power does.\n\n\nWomen in heels are often women of power. Do a quick search for \"business woman,\" and if the picture is a full-length shot, you can bet that woman is wearing heels. Business organizations like Business in Heels and Leaders in Heels use women dressed in spikey heels on their home pages, or a red pump for their logo.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, Christine Lagarde, Oprah Winfrey \u2014 all named by Forbes as the World's Most Powerful Women \u2013 are repeatedly pictured in heels.\n\nHeels even the playing field\nShutterstock\nAs a woman who stands at 6'1\" in her bare feet, heels have never been a necessity for me. When I put on 4-inch heels, I become a colossus. People literally have to crane their necks up to talk to me. But for my 5'1\" friend, heels are an instant confident boost. Even though her office doesn't require them, she wears them almost daily.\n\n\n\"I came up in restaurants and I worked with mostly men. It was always important to 'show up,' and I would say I often commanded more respect the more well put together I was,\" she says.\n\nPsychologists at the universities of Liverpool and Central Lancashire might agree. They conducted an experiment in which they digitally lengthened and shortened pictures of women, asking for instant judgments from the viewing participants. The results revealed some harsh truths. The heightened women were judged as more intelligent, assertive, independent, and ambitious \u2014 not to mention richer and more successful \u2014 than their shorter versions.\n\nDawnn Karen, M.A., Ed.Mc, of the Fashion Psychology Institute argues that, just like shorter men, women too can get a Napoleon complex. Heels are a way they can gain back some of the power they feel they lack due to their height.\n\n\n\"Wearing heels makes a woman feel in charge because height is the antithesis of power. She always wants to be taller than her opponent. [Wearing heels] literally makes her look down at someone instead of looking up at someone,\" Karen says.\n\nThe choice is yours\n\nRead More: https://www.thelist.com/33317/real-reasons-women-wear-heels/?utm_campaign=clip\n\n==Disadvantages==\nAll high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot, sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively; such shoes are a common cause of [[venous]] complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs, and have been found to provoke [[venous hypertension]] in the lower limbs.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wagner|first= T.F.|title= Influence of high-heeled shoes on venous function in young women|journal= Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume= 56|issue= 4|pages= 1039\u20131044|publisher= [[Society for Vascular Surgery]]|date= October 2012|url= http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(12)00117-6/abstract|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2012.01.039|doi-access= free}}</ref> Despite their impracticality and fluctuating demand, they persist as a fashion option.\n\nStiletto heels concentrate a large amount of force into a small area.

The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nStiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the ''[[femme fatale]]''.

In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country'' television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the [[Four Star Records|Four Star]] label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. After performing \"[[Walkin' After Midnight]]\", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.\n\nCline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and then move to [[Decca Records]] in 1960. Under the direction of producer [[Owen Bradley]], her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" would become her first to top the ''Billboard'' country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" would also become a major hit.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[When I Get Through with You]]\", \"[[So Wrong]]\" and \"[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline appeared at a benefit show in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. To return home, she boarded a plane along with country performers [[Cowboy Copas]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and manager Randy Hughes. Upon hitting rough weather, [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|the plane crashed]] outside of [[Camden, Tennessee]], killing all those on board.\n\nSince her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres.<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news  | last= Duke | first= Alan| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/showbiz/kitty-wells-legacy |title=Kitty Wells blazed country path for women |publisher=CNN |date=July 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]'' starring [[Jessica Lange]]. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical ''Always...Patsy Cline''. A 1991 box set of her recordings was issued that received critical acclaim. Her [[Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits|greatest hits album]] sold over 10 million copies in 2005.

At age 14, she declared to her mother that she was going to audition for the local radio station. Her first radio performances began at [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] in the Winchester area. According to WINC's radio disc jockey Joltin' Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station's waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, \"Well, if you've got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I've got nerve enough to let you.\"{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}} While also performing on the radio, she also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer [[Helen Morgan]].<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nCline's mother and father had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947, her father deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography ''Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline'' reported Cline had a \"beautiful relationship\" with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline's mother in saying they \"were more like sisters\" than parent and child.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}} Upon entering the ninth grade, Cline enrolled at [[John Handley High School]] in Winchester, Virginia.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father's desertion.

Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=12}} At the same time, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] performer [[Wally Fowler]] headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Following a successful audition, Cline's family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry.

With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer [[Moon Mullican]] the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=13&ndash;17}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer.

Ultimately, she became professionally known as \"Patsy Cline\".<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nIn August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest.

In an interview with ''[[People Magazine]]'', Fudge discussed her mother's legacy, \"I do understand her position in history, and the history of Nashville and country music...I'm still kind of amazed at it myself, because there's 'Mom' and then there's 'Patsy Cline,' and I'm actually a fan.\"<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\n===Marriages===\nCline was married twice.

The pair divorced in the early 1970s after having one child together. Dick helped with keeping Cline's legacy alive for the remainder of his own life. He assisted in producing several documentaries about Cline's career including ''Remembering Patsy'' and ''The Real Patsy Cline''.

She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first [[country music]] artists to successfully [[crossover (music)|cross over]] into [[pop music]].<ref>CBS News (February 18, 2009).

Popular Press. p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}.</ref> Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.\n\nCline's first professional performances began at the local [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] radio station when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country'' television broadcasts. It also led to the signing of her first recording contract with the [[Four Star Records|Four Star]] label in 1954. She had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including \"A Church, A Courtroom and Goodbye\" (1955) and \"I've Loved and Lost Again\" (1956). In 1957 however, Cline made her first national television appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. After performing \"[[Walkin' After Midnight]]\", the single would become her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.\n\nCline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline would become a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and then move to [[Decca Records]] in 1960. Under the direction of producer [[Owen Bradley]], her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" would become her first to top the ''Billboard'' country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After recovering, her next single release \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" would also become a major hit.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[When I Get Through with You]]\", \"[[So Wrong]]\" and \"[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]\". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline appeared at a benefit show in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. To return home, she boarded a plane along with country performers [[Cowboy Copas]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and manager Randy Hughes. Upon hitting rough weather, [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|the plane crashed]] outside of [[Camden, Tennessee]], killing all those on board.\n\nSince her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres.<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news  | last= Duke | first= Alan| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/showbiz/kitty-wells-legacy |title=Kitty Wells blazed country path for women |publisher=CNN |date=July 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]'' starring [[Jessica Lange]]. Several documentaries and stage shows were released during this time, including the 1988 musical ''Always...Patsy Cline''. A 1991 box set of her recordings was issued that received critical acclaim. Her [[Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits|greatest hits album]] sold over 10 million copies in 2005. In 2011, Cline's [[Patsy Cline House|childhood home]] was restored as a museum for visitors and fans to tour.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Patsy Cline's Home in Winchester, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patsy Cline House|Cline's house]] on South Kent Street in Winchester, Virginia where she lived from age 16 to 21.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1985/09/29/sweet-dreams/7eb27412-edbb-42fd-b117-7c3c5dd15655/|title=Washington Post Washington, DC, Sweet Dreams Article|last=McGhee|first=Dorothy|date=1985-09-29|website=ICPSR Data Holdings|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref>]]\nCline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley in Winchester Memorial Hospital, located in [[Winchester, Virginia]].<ref name=\"The Post\"/>  Cline's mother was only 16 years old at the time of her birth.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=7}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Daughter of a Single Mom, Singer Patsy Cline Is Still Loved |url=https://esme.com/single-moms/sons-daughters/daughter-single-mom-singer-patsy-cline-still-loved |website=Esme |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> Besides being called \"Virginia\" in her childhood, she was also referred to as \"Ginny\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sawyer |first1=Bobbie Jean |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Patsy Cline |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/patsy-cline-things-you-didnt-know/ |website=Wide Open Country |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> She temporarily lived with her mother's family in [[Gore, Virginia]] before relocating many times throughout the state.

Speaking of the incident in 1957 she said, \"I developed a terrible throat infection and my heart even stopped beating. The doctor put me in an oxygen tent.

At age 14, she declared to her mother that she was going to audition for the local radio station. Her first radio performances began at [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] in the Winchester area. According to WINC's radio disc jockey Joltin' Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station's waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, \"Well, if you've got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I've got nerve enough to let you.\"{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}} While also performing on the radio, she also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer [[Helen Morgan]].<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nCline's mother and father had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947, her father deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography ''Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline'' reported Cline had a \"beautiful relationship\" with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline's mother in saying they \"were more like sisters\" than parent and child.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}} Upon entering the ninth grade, Cline enrolled at [[John Handley High School]] in Winchester, Virginia.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father's desertion. Therefore, Cline dropped out of high school to help support the family. She began working at Gaunt's Drug Store in the Winchester area as a clerk and [[soda jerk]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}}\n\n==Career==\n===1948\u20131953: Early career===\nAt age 15, Cline wrote a letter to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] asking for an audition. She told local photographer Ralph Grubbs about the letter, \"A friend thinks I'm crazy to send it. What do you think?\" Grubbs encouraged Cline to send it. Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=12}} At the same time, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] performer [[Wally Fowler]] headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Following a successful audition, Cline's family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry. She traveled with her mother, two siblings, and a family friend on an eight-hour journey to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer [[Moon Mullican]] the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=13&ndash;17}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer. Following her audition, she began performing regularly as a member of Bill Peer's Melody Boys and Girls.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} The pair's relationship turned romantic, continuing an affair for several years.

Peer encouraged her to have a more appropriate stage name. She changed her first name from Virginia to Patsy (taken from her middle name \"Patterson\"). She kept her new last name, Cline. Ultimately, she became professionally known as \"Patsy Cline\".<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nIn August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest. She won 100 dollars and the opportunity to perform as a regular on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country Time''.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=20}} The show included country stars [[Jimmy Dean]], [[Roy Clark]], [[George Hamilton IV]] and [[Billy Grammer]],<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/> and was filmed in [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Arlington, Virginia]]. She was not officially added to the program's television shows until October 1955.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=46}} Cline's television performances received critical acclaim. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' magazine praised her stage presence, commenting, \"She creates the moods through movement of her hands and body and by the lilt of her voice, reaching way down deep in her soul to bring forth the melody. Most female country music vocalists stand motionless, sing with monotonous high-pitched nasal twang. Patsy's come up with a throaty style loaded with motion and E-motion.\"{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=52}}\n\n===1954\u20131960: Four Star Records===\nIn 1954, Bill Peer created and distributed a series of demonstration tapes with Cline's voice on it.

Songs for the session were handpicked by McCall and Paul Cohen. Four Star leased the recordings to the larger [[Decca Records]]. For those reasons [[Owen Bradley]] was chosen as the session's producer, a professional relationship that would continue into the 1960s.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=33}} Her first single release was 1955's \"A Church, A Courtroom and Then Goodbye\". Although Cline promoted it with an appearance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the song was not successful.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=38&ndash;42}}<ref name=\"Country Music Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nCline recorded a variety of musical styles while recording for Four Star.

Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack of ''Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music'' called the label's choice of material \"mediocre\". They also commented that Cline seemed to have \"groped for her own sound on the label\".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music the Rough Guide'' commented that the music was \"sturdy enough, but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} Richie Unterberger of ''[[Allmusic]]'' claimed it was Cline's voice that made the Four Star material less appealing: \"Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures.

In an interview with ''[[People Magazine]]'', Fudge discussed her mother's legacy, \"I do understand her position in history, and the history of Nashville and country music...I'm still kind of amazed at it myself, because there's 'Mom' and then there's 'Patsy Cline,' and I'm actually a fan.\"<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\n===Marriages===\nCline was married twice.

The pair divorced in the early 1970s after having one child together. Dick helped with keeping Cline's legacy alive for the remainder of his own life. He assisted in producing several documentaries about Cline's career including ''Remembering Patsy'' and ''The Real Patsy Cline''.

The stadium currently has a total capacity of 8,000 of which 790 can be seated, however this is split to a capacity for Football matches of 7,000 (540 seated) and a capacity of 1,000 (250 seated) for Greyhound Racing.\n\n==History==\nThe stadium was built originally as a trotting venue in the village of Ballyskeagh on the outskirts of [[Lisburn]] and was acquired by [[Lisburn Distillery|Distillery Football Club]] and converted into a football ground in 1980. \n\nThe club named the venue New Grosvenor Park after their [[Grosvenor Park, Belfast|previous home]] in Belfast, which had been damaged by a fire bomb attack in 1971 and was then demolished to make way for the building of a motorway link through the city in 1972.\n\nThe stadium was modified in the mid-1980s to accommodate Greyhound Racing under the operating name of Ballyskeagh Greyhound Track, rebranded as '''Drumbo Park''' in 2009, and continues to be a duel venue accommodating both Soccer and Greyhound Racing as independent bodies.\n\nThe Stadium contains four distinct structures, two on the east side of the ground and two on the west, three of which are operated by Lisburn Distillery, the club having added Lisburn to their name in 1999, and a fourth operated solely by Drumbo Park. The two companies do not allow the shared use of their spectator facilities, meaning that the Drumbo Park stand is closed during football matches, which are advertised as taking place at New Grosvenor Park while the Morton McKnight Stand, Social Club and Visiting covered terrace are all closed during Greyhound Racing meets, which are advertised as taking place at Drumbo Park. It previously held one Irish Cup semi-final every year.\n\n==Location and Access==\nThe Stadium is on the Ballyskeagh Road, a B route between Lisburn and Belfast at the small village of Ballyskeagh itself, situated three miles from Lisburn and one and a half miles from the village of Lambeg, where the nearest train station is located. The road is served by [[Ulsterbus]] rural services to and from Belfast-Lisburn.\n\nThe entrance to the stadium itself is marked with signs welcoming spectators to both New Grosvenor Stadium and Drumbo Park with a single lane track taking spectators to the car parking facilities.\n\n==Football==\n===The Morton McKnight Stand===\nThe Morton McKnight Stand is the main spectator section of the Football stadium, situated on the East side or Lambeg side of the ground and was built shortly after Lisburn Distillery acquired the venue in 1980. It covers roughly half the Lambeg side of the ground from the halfway line to the goal and is laid out in dark blue flip up plastic seating with white seats spelling out the word Whites, being the club nickname. The stand seats 527 spectators, including 25 seats in the directors box. The stand also houses a journalist's commentary box to its rear.\n\n===Lisburn Distillery Social Club and Offices===\nThe Distillery social club and offices sit on the same side of the stadium as the Morton McKnight stand occupying the area situated on the other side of the halfway line. The facilities are situated in one building, separated from the Morton McKnight Stand by a large tarmac paddock and does not offer any terracing or seated stand, although many spectators chose to stand and watch games from the paddock situated between the facilities and the pitch. The club and offices is a two-story building containing a social club on the upper level with bar, television and a small dance floor for social events. The windows on one side of the social club are whitewashed to prevent patrons from being able to view the football from inside. The club is most commonly accessed from a fire escape, which leads spectators down to the paddock between the social club and Morton McKnight Stand. The upper floor also contains a small toilet block and executive lounge. The executive lounge is the only official spectator facility in the building and consists of a small function room with its own private bar and viewing box. The box offers seating for thirteen spectators while the lounge accommodates around thirty. The Executive lounge is open to any spectator wishing to purchase a season ticket to view matches there and also hosts the match sponsors.\n\nThe lower deck contains the club offices, boardroom, dressing rooms and player's tunnel as well as a smaller function room, which is usually only opened for matches against opponents that can generate an attendance that breaks the 1,000 mark. Irish League clubs do not officially record attendances but Lisburn Distillery receipts suggest their average attendances sit at around 300 to 400. The small function room is accessed through the club shop, which also houses a small club museum containing medals, International caps, banners, old shirts, programmes and euphemia from the club's history.\n\nBeside the social club is a large undeveloped paddock where the only food on offer on match days is provided by a fixed burger van.\n\n===The Visiting Covered Terrace===\nThe covered terrace is situated on the west or Belfast side of the ground and is essentially a covered terrace of fifteen tiers with a paddock at the back. This section of the ground is often the most popular place for the most vocal fans of visiting clubs to gather, however segregation is rarely required at Lisburn Distillery games and home and visiting fans are allowed to sit or stand wherever they wish in the spectator facilities offered for Football. The terrace can safely accommodate 1,500 spectators. The terrace occupies an area of around one third the length of the ground.\n\n===Behind the goals===\nNeither end of the ground has been developed and each end has been 'claimed' by the two operating companies for their use. The Ballyskeagh end of the ground is little more than a loose gravel track that takes spectators from the Lambeg side of the ground to the covered terrace on match days. The entrances to the covered terrace were situated on the Belfast side of the ground but are no longer accessible without arrangement from Drumbo Park as the Greyhound operators erected security gates outside the ground, blocking access to these entrances in 2009. Viewing of Football from here is allowed but few fans view from here as the location of the Greyhound track places the path some distance away from the goal.\n\nThe opposite end or River Lagan end for location purposes is used by the Drumbo Park greyhound facilities as the kennels and greyhound preparation area on race nights. Curiously this area is accessible from the Morton McKnight stand during Football matches but is not accessible by spectators of the Drumbo Park Greyhound Stand at its other end. As at the other end of the ground, there is no interest for spectators to view the game from behind this goal and, as this end does not provide access to the stands on the other side of the ground, remains unused during Football matches.\n\n==Greyhound Racing==\n[[File:Drumbo Park - Greyhound Track - geograph-1445560.jpg|right|thumb|Greyhound track around football pitch]]\n\n===History===\nNorthern Irish greyhound tracks are unusual in the sport of greyhound racing due to the fact that they do not fall within the jurisdiction of the [[Greyhound Board of Great Britain]]. Instead the [[Bord na gCon|Irish Greyhound Board]] oversee proceedings.\n\nA greyhound track called Ballyskeagh was constructed in May 1994<ref>{{cite news|title=Closures and openings over the past 10 years, July 1993, page 18|year=1993|newspaper=Greyhound Star}}</ref> and became Belfast's only circuit following the 1996 closure of [[Dunmore Stadium]]. Distances covered were 375, 525, 550, 575, 600 & 880 yards. The Irish Greyhound Board did not fund the track and this was a major factor in the closure of the stadium to greyhound racing on 24 October 2005 after struggling for many years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=Jonathan|title=Greyhound Annual 2008|year=2007|publisher=Raceform|isbn=978-1-905153-53-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-october-2/|title=Remember When - October|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 the track re-opened with the new name of Drumbo Park, with state of the art facilities. A 350-seat grandstand restaurant took centre stage under a new era and racing takes place every Friday and Saturday. The first [[Northern Irish Derby]] was held at the track from 2011 until 2014, the event was sponsored by Bettor.com and carried a \u00a325,000 prize, the richest ever held in Northern Ireland. The event lost some status two years later after the prize money was cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/a-new-era-for-greyhound-racing-as-the-3m-drumbo-park-opens-28484278.html|title=A new era for greyhound racing as the \u00a33m Drumbo Park opens|publisher=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there are four structures around the track and pitch they are used independently by the football club and greyhound company which results in the football ground closing at 6.30pm and the greyhound racing opening straight after. On 11 January 2019 the greyhound racing was suspended, the reason given by the ex-Lisburn Distillery directors, John McCollum, Michael McAdam and Tommy Anderson was the difficulty in making a trading profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/not-shocked-drumbo/|title=\u2018NOT SO SHOCKED\u2019 BY DRUMBO|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/01/11/news/blow-to-greyhound-racing-as-drumbo-park-track-shuts-after-10-years-1526276/|title=Blow to greyhound racing as Drumbo Park track shuts after 10 years|publisher=Irish news}}</ref>\n\nThe track re-opened on 13 July 2019 under the management of 'Run With Passion Ltd' and new working practices were employed, including pre-race veterinary inspection of all runners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/01/11/news/blow-to-greyhound-racing-as-drumbo-park-track-shuts-after-10-years-1526276/|title=Running On Passion \u2013 Drumbo Re-Opens|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\n===Drumbo Park Stand===\n[[File:Drumbo Park - Pavilion - geograph-1445555.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Drumbo Park Stand]]\nThe Drumbo Park Stand is operated independently by Drumbo Park Greyhound Racing and is not open to spectators during Football matches, in turn this is the only area of the ground open during Greyhound Racing and is accessed from the opposite side of the stadium from the main Football facilities. This is the newest stand in the stadium, having been built in 2008 and is purpose built for Greyhound Racing with a large, indoor, glass fronted spectator restaurant making up the majority of the stand with a small spectator paddock outside to the front. The restaurant is a la carte and offers seating for 250 racegoers with [[Tote board|Tote operators]] on hand for betting. Spectators need to book in advance to ensure a seat or they can stand in the front paddock, which accommodates 750 spectators and has bookmakers booths trackside.\n\n===Competitions===\n*[[Northern Irish Derby]]\n\n===Track records===\n'''Current'''\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/irish-track-records-breeding/|title=Track records|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/irish-track-records-breeding-2/|title=Cork Track records|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|-\n!width=100| Yards\n!width=200| Greyhound\n!width=50| Time\n!width=200| Date\n|-align=center \n|335\t||Lily Mayday <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.igb.ie/results/view-results/?track=DBP&date=02-Oct-10#race10|title=335 track record|publisher=Irish Greyhound Board}}</ref>      ||17.62\t||02.10.2010\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Leeview Jet <ref>{{cite news|title=Monthly Greyhound Star (Remember When 2010) October edition|newspaper=Greyhound Star}}</ref>   ||27.88\t||23.10.2010\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Jaxx on Fantasy   ||29.45\t||5 October 2013\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Lemon Velvet      ||30.90\t||25 June 2011\n|-align=center \n|835\t||Castlegore Star   ||46.43\t||25 June 2011\n|}\n'''Former'''\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|-\n!width=100| Yards\n!width=200| Greyhound\n!width=50| Time\n!width=200| Date\n|-align=center \n|335\t||Head Man Boo\t||17.74\t||27 September 2008\n|-align=center \n|375\t||Prime Location\t||19.89\t||11 June 1999\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Jewel Black\t||28.48\t||27 October 1997\t\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Ramels Black\t||=28.48\t||2003\t\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Gilbeyhall Jake\t||28.38\t||21 March 2009\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Moral Duty\t||28.08\t||2 October 2010\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Duffys Kestrel\t||29.85\t||12 December 1997\t\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Drumcrow Marco\t||30.10\t||27 June 2009\n|-align=center \n|550||Pocket Gal\t||30.05\t||23 July 2009\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Eden Brett\t||29.79\t||12 November 2009\t\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Rafas Wee Pet\t||29.77\t||11 June 2011\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Leeview Jet\t||29.51\t||18 June 2011\t\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Duffys Kestrel\t||31.53\t||23 October 1998\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Lady Spiral\t||31.50\t||26 April 2003\t\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Prince Adam\t||31.46\t||15 November 2003\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Dooey Shaw\t||31.32\t||28 February 2009\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Monleek Bay\t||31.27\t||15 October 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|600\t||Chesters Choice\t||32.46\t||27 June 1997\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Fast Bond\t||47.03\t||23 December 2009\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Ferdia Bound\t||46.84\t||30 April 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Ferdia Bound\t||46.53\t||25 September 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|880\t||Lisduff Flash\t||49.85||\t14 January 2000\n|-align=center \n|880\t||Hi Bubblesnsuds\t||49.72\t||16 August 2003\t\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfCvg0xCNM] The Ulster Groundhop tour of the ground\n*http://www.nipremgrounds.co.uk/lisburn_distillery_football_ground/\n*http://blue.srv2.com/~lisburn/Lisburn%20Distillery%20FC-%20Directions%20to%20ground.html\n*[http://home.online.no/~smogols/ifcp/clubs/lisburndistillery/gallerylisburndistillery.htm IFCP photos from New Grosvenor Stadium]\n*[http://www.igb.ie/ Irish Greyhound Board]\n\n{{Greyhound stadiums in Ireland}}\n{{coord|54|32|9|N|6|0|13|W|region:GB_type:landmark|display=t}}\n\n[[Category:Association football venues in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C.]]\n[[Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Association football venues in County Down]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1980]]\n[[Category:Greyhound racing venues in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in Northern Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox racecourse\n|name         = New Grosvenor Stadium <br>and Drumbo Park\n|image        = New Grosvenor Stadium Stand -

The executive lounge is the only official spectator facility in the building and consists of a small function room with its own private bar and viewing box. The box offers seating for thirteen spectators while the lounge accommodates around thirty. The Executive lounge is open to any spectator wishing to purchase a season ticket to view matches there and also hosts the match sponsors.\n\nThe lower deck contains the club offices, boardroom, dressing rooms and player's tunnel as well as a smaller function room, which is usually only opened for matches against opponents that can generate an attendance that breaks the 1,000 mark. Irish League clubs do not officially record attendances but Lisburn Distillery receipts suggest their average attendances sit at around 300 to 400. The small function room is accessed through the club shop, which also houses a small club museum containing medals, International caps, banners, old shirts, programmes and euphemia from the club's history.\n\nBeside the social club is a large undeveloped paddock where the only food on offer on match days is provided by a fixed burger van.\n\n===The Visiting Covered Terrace===\nThe covered terrace is situated on the west or Belfast side of the ground and is essentially a covered terrace of fifteen tiers with a paddock at the back. This section of the ground is often the most popular place for the most vocal fans of visiting clubs to gather, however segregation is rarely required at Lisburn Distillery games and home and visiting fans are allowed to sit or stand wherever they wish in the spectator facilities offered for Football. The terrace can safely accommodate 1,500 spectators. The terrace occupies an area of around one third the length of the ground.\n\n===Behind the goals===\nNeither end of the ground has been developed and each end has been 'claimed' by the two operating companies for their use. The Ballyskeagh end of the ground is little more than a loose gravel track that takes spectators from the Lambeg side of the ground to the covered terrace on match days. The entrances to the covered terrace were situated on the Belfast side of the ground but are no longer accessible without arrangement from Drumbo Park as the Greyhound operators erected security gates outside the ground, blocking access to these entrances in 2009. Viewing of Football from here is allowed but few fans view from here as the location of the Greyhound track places the path some distance away from the goal.\n\nThe opposite end or River Lagan end for location purposes is used by the Drumbo Park greyhound facilities as the kennels and greyhound preparation area on race nights. Curiously this area is accessible from the Morton McKnight stand during Football matches but is not accessible by spectators of the Drumbo Park Greyhound Stand at its other end. As at the other end of the ground, there is no interest for spectators to view the game from behind this goal and, as this end does not provide access to the stands on the other side of the ground, remains unused during Football matches.\n\n==Greyhound Racing==\n[[File:Drumbo Park - Greyhound Track - geograph-1445560.jpg|right|thumb|Greyhound track around football pitch]]\n\n===History===\nNorthern Irish greyhound tracks are unusual in the sport of greyhound racing due to the fact that they do not fall within the jurisdiction of the [[Greyhound Board of Great Britain]]. Instead the [[Bord na gCon|Irish Greyhound Board]] oversee proceedings.\n\nA greyhound track called Ballyskeagh was constructed in May 1994<ref>{{cite news|title=Closures and openings over the past 10 years, July 1993, page 18|year=1993|newspaper=Greyhound Star}}</ref> and became Belfast's only circuit following the 1996 closure of [[Dunmore Stadium]]. Distances covered were 375, 525, 550, 575, 600 & 880 yards. The Irish Greyhound Board did not fund the track and this was a major factor in the closure of the stadium to greyhound racing on 24 October 2005 after struggling for many years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=Jonathan|title=Greyhound Annual 2008|year=2007|publisher=Raceform|isbn=978-1-905153-53-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-october-2/|title=Remember When - October|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 the track re-opened with the new name of Drumbo Park, with state of the art facilities. A 350-seat grandstand restaurant took centre stage under a new era and racing takes place every Friday and Saturday. The first [[Northern Irish Derby]] was held at the track from 2011 until 2014, the event was sponsored by Bettor.com and carried a \u00a325,000 prize, the richest ever held in Northern Ireland. The event lost some status two years later after the prize money was cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/a-new-era-for-greyhound-racing-as-the-3m-drumbo-park-opens-28484278.html|title=A new era for greyhound racing as the \u00a33m Drumbo Park opens|publisher=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there are four structures around the track and pitch they are used independently by the football club and greyhound company which results in the football ground closing at 6.30pm and the greyhound racing opening straight after. On 11 January 2019 the greyhound racing was suspended, the reason given by the ex-Lisburn Distillery directors, John McCollum, Michael McAdam and Tommy Anderson was the difficulty in making a trading profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/not-shocked-drumbo/|title=\u2018NOT SO SHOCKED\u2019 BY DRUMBO|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/01/11/news/blow-to-greyhound-racing-as-drumbo-park-track-shuts-after-10-years-1526276/|title=Blow to greyhound racing as Drumbo Park track shuts after 10 years|publisher=Irish news}}</ref>\n\nThe track re-opened on 13 July 2019 under the management of 'Run With Passion Ltd' and new working practices were employed, including pre-race veterinary inspection of all runners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2019/01/11/news/blow-to-greyhound-racing-as-drumbo-park-track-shuts-after-10-years-1526276/|title=Running On Passion \u2013 Drumbo Re-Opens|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\n===Drumbo Park Stand===\n[[File:Drumbo Park - Pavilion - geograph-1445555.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Drumbo Park Stand]]\nThe Drumbo Park Stand is operated independently by Drumbo Park Greyhound Racing and is not open to spectators during Football matches, in turn this is the only area of the ground open during Greyhound Racing and is accessed from the opposite side of the stadium from the main Football facilities. This is the newest stand in the stadium, having been built in 2008 and is purpose built for Greyhound Racing with a large, indoor, glass fronted spectator restaurant making up the majority of the stand with a small spectator paddock outside to the front. The restaurant is a la carte and offers seating for 250 racegoers with [[Tote board|Tote operators]] on hand for betting. Spectators need to book in advance to ensure a seat or they can stand in the front paddock, which accommodates 750 spectators and has bookmakers booths trackside.\n\n===Competitions===\n*[[Northern Irish Derby]]\n\n===Track records===\n'''Current'''\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/irish-track-records-breeding/|title=Track records|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/irish-track-records-breeding-2/|title=Cork Track records|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|-\n!width=100| Yards\n!width=200| Greyhound\n!width=50| Time\n!width=200| Date\n|-align=center \n|335\t||Lily Mayday <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.igb.ie/results/view-results/?track=DBP&date=02-Oct-10#race10|title=335 track record|publisher=Irish Greyhound Board}}</ref>      ||17.62\t||02.10.2010\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Leeview Jet <ref>{{cite news|title=Monthly Greyhound Star (Remember When 2010) October edition|newspaper=Greyhound Star}}</ref>   ||27.88\t||23.10.2010\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Jaxx on Fantasy   ||29.45\t||5 October 2013\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Lemon Velvet      ||30.90\t||25 June 2011\n|-align=center \n|835\t||Castlegore Star   ||46.43\t||25 June 2011\n|}\n'''Former'''\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|-\n!width=100| Yards\n!width=200| Greyhound\n!width=50| Time\n!width=200| Date\n|-align=center \n|335\t||Head Man Boo\t||17.74\t||27 September 2008\n|-align=center \n|375\t||Prime Location\t||19.89\t||11 June 1999\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Jewel Black\t||28.48\t||27 October 1997\t\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Ramels Black\t||=28.48\t||2003\t\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Gilbeyhall Jake\t||28.38\t||21 March 2009\n|-align=center \n|525\t||Moral Duty\t||28.08\t||2 October 2010\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Duffys Kestrel\t||29.85\t||12 December 1997\t\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Drumcrow Marco\t||30.10\t||27 June 2009\n|-align=center \n|550||Pocket Gal\t||30.05\t||23 July 2009\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Eden Brett\t||29.79\t||12 November 2009\t\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Rafas Wee Pet\t||29.77\t||11 June 2011\n|-align=center \n|550\t||Leeview Jet\t||29.51\t||18 June 2011\t\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Duffys Kestrel\t||31.53\t||23 October 1998\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Lady Spiral\t||31.50\t||26 April 2003\t\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Prince Adam\t||31.46\t||15 November 2003\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Dooey Shaw\t||31.32\t||28 February 2009\n|-align=center \n|575\t||Monleek Bay\t||31.27\t||15 October 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|600\t||Chesters Choice\t||32.46\t||27 June 1997\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Fast Bond\t||47.03\t||23 December 2009\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Ferdia Bound\t||46.84\t||30 April 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|836\t||Ferdia Bound\t||46.53\t||25 September 2010\t\n|-align=center \n|880\t||Lisduff Flash\t||49.85||\t14 January 2000\n|-align=center \n|880\t||Hi Bubblesnsuds\t||49.72\t||16 August 2003\t\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfCvg0xCNM] The Ulster Groundhop tour of the ground\n*http://www.nipremgrounds.co.uk/lisburn_distillery_football_ground/\n*http://blue.srv2.com/~lisburn/Lisburn%20Distillery%20FC-%20Directions%20to%20ground.html\n*[http://home.online.no/~smogols/ifcp/clubs/lisburndistillery/gallerylisburndistillery.htm IFCP photos from New Grosvenor Stadium]\n*[http://www.igb.ie/ Irish Greyhound Board]\n\n{{Greyhound stadiums in Ireland}}\n{{coord|54|32|9|N|6|0|13|W|region:GB_type:landmark|display=t}}\n\n[[Category:Association football venues in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C.]]\n[[Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Association football venues in County Down]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1980]]\n[[Category:Greyhound racing venues in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in Northern Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "Nextepisodeofyiay", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Grosvenor_Stadium"}

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

When he asks \"Who do ''you'' say that I am?\", Simon Peter answers, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\" Jesus then declares:\n\n{{quote|Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.

While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\".

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was 'as usual' accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]].

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"Romam eo iterum crucifigi (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\").

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]]\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome\"</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on Earth (with Christ being its [[heaven]]ly head) is based on its interpretation of two passages from the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]; as well as [[sacred tradition]].\n\n====John 21:15\u201317====\nThe first passage is {{Bibleref2|John|21:15\u201317}} which is: \"Feed my lambs...

He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations\".\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In the Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination etcetera, reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient... Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline'']. Archive date: 9 December 2003. Access date: 19 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOf the two epistles, the [[First Epistle of Peter|first epistle]] is considered the earlier. A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]].<ref name=\"ce-epistles\">{{cathEncy|wstitle=Epistles of St. Peter|volume=11|author=Vander Heeren, Achille}}</ref>\n\n[[Jerome]] explains:\n\n{{quote|The two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which proves that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters ''(Epistle 120 \u2013 To Hedibia)''<ref name=\"Jerome\">{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=Epistle 120 \u2013 To Hedibia Question 11|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_hedibia_2_trans.htm|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nSome have seen a reference to the use of a secretary in the sentence: \"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand\".{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:12|ESV|1 Pet. 5:12}} However New Testament scholar [[Bart D.

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. \n<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\".

According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered.

It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts and not in the [[history]].\n\nIt has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.<ref>White, L. Michael (2004). ''From Jesus to Christianity''. Harper SanFrancisco. p. 170. {{ISBN|0-06-052655-6}}.</ref>\n\nAnother revisionist view was developed by supporters of the [[Christ myth theory]], which holds that the figure of Peter is largely a development from some mythological doorkeeper figures. According to [[Arthur Drews]] and [[George Albert Wells|G. A.

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].

Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1\u201312}}\n\nIn the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, [[Restoration of Peter|three times affirmed his love for Jesus]], balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position. The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.\n\n===Leader of the early church===\n[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], 1620\u201321]]\n\nPeter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church.<ref>Galatians 2:9</ref> Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem ''ekkl\u0113sia'' mentioned by Paul.{{sfn|Pagels|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|p=116}} He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Pagels|2005|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}} According to L\u00fcdemann, this was due to the discussions about the [[Paul and Judaism|strictness of adherence]] to the Jewish Law, when the more conservative faction of James the Just<ref>{{cite journal |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |journal=Currents in Research |volume=5 |pages=73\u2013122 |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.|doi=10.1177/1476993X06068700 |year=2006 }}</ref> took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence.{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}}{{refn|group=note|At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts.

Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was 'as usual' accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"Romam eo iterum crucifigi (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]]\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations\".\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In the Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination etcetera, reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient... Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. \n<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\".

In the east the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)'' preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his Church History (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

The primary meaning interested us because it is used in an ancient Chinese proverb that describes the Hulu as the holder of precious things. It literally translates to \"gourd,\" and in ancient times, the Hulu was hollowed out and used to hold precious things. The secondary meaning is \"interactive recording\".
