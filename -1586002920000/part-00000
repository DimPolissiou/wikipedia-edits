Creed's work ''Work No. 200: Half the air in a given space'' (1998) is a room which has half of its cubic space filled with balloons.\n\n===Projects===\nCreed won the 2001 [[Turner Prize]] for two exhibitions, ''Martin Creed Works'' and ''Art Now: Martin Creed'' shown across England during the preceding year.<ref name=turnerTate/> His submission for the Turner Prize show at the [[Tate Gallery]] was ''Work No. 227: The lights going on and off''. The work was an empty room in which the lights switched on and off at 5-second intervals. As so often with the Turner Prize, this created a great deal of press attention, most of it questioning whether something as [[minimalism|minimalist]] as this could be considered art at all. Nevertheless, the jury praised this work, saying they \"admired the audacity in presenting a single work in the exhibition and noted its strength, rigour, wit and sensitivity to the site\".<ref name=turnerBBC/> [[File:Martin Creed 56653sAI.jpg|thumb|Work No. 850 an athlete running through Tate Britain gallery]]His work has often excited controversy: another successful artist, Jacqueline Crofton threw eggs at the walls of Creed's empty room as a protest against the prize, declaring that Creed's presentations were not real art and that \"painting is in danger of becoming an extinct skill in this country\".<ref name=\"turnerprotests\">Youngs, Ian (2002)[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2382373.stm \"The art of Turner protests\", BBC] www.bbc.co.uk, 31 October 2002.

In 2010, ''Work No. 1020: Ballet'' was performed at the [[Traverse Theatre]], Edinburgh as part of the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and at The Kitchen, New York, in December 2013. ''Work No. 1020'' was also performed in 2014 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in connection with Creed's retrospective at the [[Hayward Gallery]], London.

Although ''Work No. 975'' is a unique sculpture, the phrase has been used on several related works, each assigned its own work number. Previous to ''Work No. 975,'' a red neon text appeared in New York's Times Square (''Work No.225'' 1999, commissioned by [[Public Art Fund]]), a thirty-metre-long version was installed in Detroit (''Work No.790'' 2007), and another text in white neon ran the 75&nbsp;ft length of the Rennie Museum's fa\u00e7ade in Vancouver's Chinatown (''Work No.851'' 2008). Most recently, a 46-metre multicoloured version was commissioned for [[Christchurch Art Gallery]], in the advent of its reopening after almost five years of earthquake-related closure.\n\nIn 2011 Creed was commissioned by [[Fruitmarket Gallery]] to make a work as part of the restoration of the historic Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh. Creed's ''Work No. 1059'' was subsequently installed, cladding each of the 104 steps and landings in a different type of marble. ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic Jonathan Jones called it \"a generous, modest masterpiece of contemporary public art\".<ref>Jones, J. 3 September 2013. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/sep/03/martin-creed-lights-on-off 'Martin Creed's light goes on and off for me']. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 29 December 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Creed was the first artist to participate in the long-term programme of artist-conceived restaurants at Sketch, London. Together with a series of paintings and wall drawings, Creed specifically created ''Work No. 1343'' where every single piece of cutlery, glass, chair and table was different and brought together a mix of the mass-produced and hand-crafted, from classic antiques to contemporary design from all around the world. ''Work No. 1347,'' still on display at the restaurant, consists of 96 different types of marble, in a herringbone formation across the floor.\n\n===Music===\nCreed's first band, Owada, was formed in 1994 with Adam McEwen and Keiko Owada. In 1997, they released their first CD, \"Nothing\", on [[David Cunningham (musician)|David Cunningham]]'s Piano label. Sound has also featured in his gallery-based work, with pieces using doorbells, drum machines and metronomes. Since 1999 he has not used the band name \"Owada\". In 2000, he published a recording of his songs titled ''I Can't Move'' under his own name with the arts publisher [[Art Metropole]], in Toronto.\n\nIn 2010, he provided the cover art for a [[Futuristic Retro Champions]] single, while supporting its launch with an appearance with his own band.\n\nCreed started his own label, Telephone Records, and released the single \"Thinking/ Not Thinking\" in early 2011, following it up with the single \"Where You Go\" in 2012. Releases accelerated in 2012, with the Double AA Side single \"Fuck Off\" and \"Die\" coming out on [[Moshi Moshi Records]] in May 2012, in advance of the album ''Love To You'', released on Moshi Moshi in July 2012. The album is produced by David Cunningham, Martin Creed and The Nice NIce Boys (Andrew Knowles of [[Johnny Marr|Johnny Marr & The Healers]] and [[Nick McCarthy]] of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]). The Vinyl Factory worked with Creed to produce a limited edition of the release which featured hand-painted covers by Creed. The single \"You're The One For Me\" came out at the same time as the album.\n\nJanuary 2014 saw the release ''Mind Trap'', an album that featured songs alongside instrumental pieces for orchestra. Creed sings and plays the instruments, supported by gospel singers Dee Alexander and Yvonne Gage (who have worked with The Police, Madonna and R.Kelly) and Andy Knowles (musical credits include stints with the Fiery Furnaces & Franz Ferdinand) playing drums on If You're Lonely, You Return and Don't Tell Me. Keiko Owada plays bass on Gift Attack / Don't Won't. Co-produced by Martin with Andy Knowles, the album was recorded in London, Chicago and the Czech Republic. Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand and Mark Ralph (who works with Hot Chip) provided additional production. The Chicago songs, which form the heart of the album, were recorded all-analogue at John McEntire's (Tortoise) Soma Studios. Engineered by Bill Skibbe (The Kills/Franz Ferdinand). It also includes 3 specially commissioned orchestral works: ''Work No. 955'' was originally written for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, ''Work No. 994'' was composed for the Hiroshima Symphony Orchestra and ''Work No. 1375'' was commissioned by the London Sinfonietta. These pieces were recorded for the album by the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mikel Toms. All lyrics and music on the album are written by Martin Creed, with the exception of the New Shutters which is Martin's arrangement of a traditional Neapolitan folk song. The album sleeve features one of Martin's paintings, ''Work No. 1674: Anouchka'' and was designed by Andy Knowles, who has recently directed videos for Franz Ferdinand and The Cribs. Martin Creed is also much loved by [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] - regular attendees at his gigs and co-producers on his album 'Mind Trap' -  as well as Moshi Moshi label-mates Slow Club.\n\nA new body of audiovisual work was released in late November 2015 in response to the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]]. The double A-side single \u201cLet Them In / Border Control\u201d was made available via Telephone Records as free downloads on Soundcloud. Both songs are accompanied by videos which Creed made himself.\n\nIn July 2016, Martin Creed released a new album entitled ''Thoughts Lined Up''. The album includes the singles \"Understanding\" and \"Princess Taxi Girl\" for which accompanying videos have been released.\n\n=== Discography ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Type\n!Date\n!Format\n!Label\n|-\n|What The Fuck Am I Doing?\n|Single\n|2017\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Blow And Suck\n|Single\n|2017\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|It's You\n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Princess Taxi Girl\n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thoughts Lined Up\n|Album\n|2016\n|CD, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Understanding \n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Let Them In / Border Control\n|Double A-Side Single\n|2015\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Mind Trap\n|Album\n|2014\n|CD, 12\" Vinyl, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Blow And Suck / I Want You\n|Single\n|2013\n|Special Edition 12\" Vinyl\n|The Vinyl Factory\n|-\n|Chicago\n|EP\n|2012\n|Special Edition 12\" Vinyl\n|Telephone Records / The Vinyl Factory / MCA Chicago\n|-\n|You're The One For Me\n|Single\n|2012\n|Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Love To You\n|Album\n|2012\n|CD, 12\" Vinyl, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Fuck Off / Die\n|Double A-Side Single\n|2012\n|Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Where You Go\n|Split Single\n|2012\n|CD & DVD, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thinking / Not Thinking\n|Single\n|2011\n|CD & DVD, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thinking / Not Thinking / Words\n|Single\n|2009\n|7\" Vinyl\n|In collaboration with Hiromi Yoshii, Japan\n|-\n|Work No. 815\n|Single\n|2008\n|7\" Vinyl\n|Smart Guy Records\n|-\n|I Can't Move\n|EP\n|2000\n|CD\n|Art Metropole, Canada\n|-\n|EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT\n|Single\n|1999\n|CD\n|Pier Trust\n|-\n|Nothing (Owada)\n|Album\n|1997\n|CD\n|Piano\n|}\n\n===On art===\n\nIn an interview published in the book ''Art Now: Interviews with Modern Artists'' (2002), Creed explains that he used to 'make paintings' but never liked having to decide what to paint. He decided to stop making paintings and instead to think about what it meant, and why he wanted to make things. He says:\n\n{{cquote|The only thing I feel like I know is that I want to make things. Other than that, I feel like I don\u2019t know. So the problem is in trying to make something without knowing what I want. [...] I think it\u2019s all to do with ''wanting'' to communicate. I mean, I think I want to make things because I want to communicate with people, because I want to be loved, because I want to express myself.}}\n\nCreed says that he makes art works not as part of an academic exploration of 'conceptual' art, but rather from a wish to connect with people, 'wanting to communicate and wanting to say hello'. The work is therefore primarily [[emotion]]al:\n\n{{cquote|To me it\u2019s emotional. Aye. To me that\u2019s the starting point. I mean, I do it because I want to make something. I think that\u2019s a desire, you know, or a need. I think that I recognise that I want to make something, and so I try to make something. But then you get to thinking about it and that\u2019s where the problems start because you can\u2019t help thinking about it, wondering whether it\u2019s good or bad. But to me it\u2019s emotional more than anything else.}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\nIn 1996, [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and Roger Ackling selected Creed to exhibit at [[EASTinternational]]. In the decade since winning the Turner Prize he has exhibited extensively throughout the world, including large survey shows at Trussardi Foundation, Milan ('I Like Things'), [[Bard College]], New York ('Feelings'), and a touring exhibition which started at [[Ikon Gallery]] Birmingham and toured to Hiroshima and Seoul.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe first major survey show of Creed's, 'What's the point of it?', took place at the Hayward Gallery, London, in January 2014. The exhibition included a number of his best-known works, from the installation ''Work No. 227 The Lights Going On and Off'' (2000), ''Work No. 293 A sheet of paper crumpled into a ball'' (2003), to his epic sculpture ''Work No. 1092 MOTHERS'' (2011). Coinciding with the exhibition at the Hayward, the [[Southbank Centre]] commissioned Martin to compose a new piece for the Royal Festival Hall organ, resulting in ''Work No''.

The work was an empty room in which the lights switched on and off at 5-second intervals. As so often with the Turner Prize, this created a great deal of press attention, most of it questioning whether something as [[minimalism|minimalist]] as this could be considered art at all. Nevertheless, the jury praised this work, saying they \"admired the audacity in presenting a single work in the exhibition and noted its strength, rigour, wit and sensitivity to the site\".<ref name=turnerBBC/> [[File:Martin Creed 56653sAI.jpg|thumb|Work No. 850 an athlete running through Tate Britain gallery]]His work has often excited controversy: a visitor threw eggs at the walls of Creed's empty room as a protest against the prize, declaring that Creed's presentations were not real art and that \"painting is in danger of becoming an extinct skill in this country\".<ref name=\"turnerprotests\">Youngs, Ian (2002)[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2382373.stm \"The art of Turner protests\", BBC] www.bbc.co.uk, 31 October 2002.

In 2010, ''Work No. 1020: Ballet'' was performed at the [[Traverse Theatre]], Edinburgh as part of the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and at The Kitchen, New York, in December 2013. ''Work No. 1020'' was also performed in 2014 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in connection with Creed's retrospective at the [[Hayward Gallery]], London.

Although ''Work No. 975'' is a unique sculpture, the phrase has been used on several related works, each assigned its own work number. Previous to ''Work No. 975,'' a red neon text appeared in New York's Times Square (''Work No.225'' 1999, commissioned by [[Public Art Fund]]), a thirty-metre-long version was installed in Detroit (''Work No.790'' 2007), and another text in white neon ran the 75&nbsp;ft length of the Rennie Museum's fa\u00e7ade in Vancouver's Chinatown (''Work No.851'' 2008). Most recently, a 46-metre multicoloured version was commissioned for [[Christchurch Art Gallery]], in the advent of its reopening after almost five years of earthquake-related closure.\n\nIn 2011 Creed was commissioned by [[Fruitmarket Gallery]] to make a work as part of the restoration of the historic Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh. Creed's ''Work No. 1059'' was subsequently installed, cladding each of the 104 steps and landings in a different type of marble. ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic Jonathan Jones called it \"a generous, modest masterpiece of contemporary public art\".<ref>Jones, J. 3 September 2013. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/sep/03/martin-creed-lights-on-off 'Martin Creed's light goes on and off for me']. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 29 December 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Creed was the first artist to participate in the long-term programme of artist-conceived restaurants at Sketch, London. Together with a series of paintings and wall drawings, Creed specifically created ''Work No. 1343'' where every single piece of cutlery, glass, chair and table was different and brought together a mix of the mass-produced and hand-crafted, from classic antiques to contemporary design from all around the world. ''Work No. 1347,'' still on display at the restaurant, consists of 96 different types of marble, in a herringbone formation across the floor.\n\n===Music===\nCreed's first band, Owada, was formed in 1994 with Adam McEwen and Keiko Owada. In 1997, they released their first CD, \"Nothing\", on [[David Cunningham (musician)|David Cunningham]]'s Piano label. Sound has also featured in his gallery-based work, with pieces using doorbells, drum machines and metronomes. Since 1999 he has not used the band name \"Owada\". In 2000, he published a recording of his songs titled ''I Can't Move'' under his own name with the arts publisher [[Art Metropole]], in Toronto.\n\nIn 2010, he provided the cover art for a [[Futuristic Retro Champions]] single, while supporting its launch with an appearance with his own band.\n\nCreed started his own label, Telephone Records, and released the single \"Thinking/ Not Thinking\" in early 2011, following it up with the single \"Where You Go\" in 2012. Releases accelerated in 2012, with the Double AA Side single \"Fuck Off\" and \"Die\" coming out on [[Moshi Moshi Records]] in May 2012, in advance of the album ''Love To You'', released on Moshi Moshi in July 2012. The album is produced by David Cunningham, Martin Creed and The Nice NIce Boys (Andrew Knowles of [[Johnny Marr|Johnny Marr & The Healers]] and [[Nick McCarthy]] of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]). The Vinyl Factory worked with Creed to produce a limited edition of the release which featured hand-painted covers by Creed. The single \"You're The One For Me\" came out at the same time as the album.\n\nJanuary 2014 saw the release ''Mind Trap'', an album that featured songs alongside instrumental pieces for orchestra. Creed sings and plays the instruments, supported by gospel singers Dee Alexander and Yvonne Gage (who have worked with The Police, Madonna and R.Kelly) and Andy Knowles (musical credits include stints with the Fiery Furnaces & Franz Ferdinand) playing drums on If You're Lonely, You Return and Don't Tell Me. Keiko Owada plays bass on Gift Attack / Don't Won't. Co-produced by Martin with Andy Knowles, the album was recorded in London, Chicago and the Czech Republic. Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand and Mark Ralph (who works with Hot Chip) provided additional production. The Chicago songs, which form the heart of the album, were recorded all-analogue at John McEntire's (Tortoise) Soma Studios. Engineered by Bill Skibbe (The Kills/Franz Ferdinand). It also includes 3 specially commissioned orchestral works: ''Work No. 955'' was originally written for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, ''Work No. 994'' was composed for the Hiroshima Symphony Orchestra and ''Work No. 1375'' was commissioned by the London Sinfonietta. These pieces were recorded for the album by the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mikel Toms. All lyrics and music on the album are written by Martin Creed, with the exception of the New Shutters which is Martin's arrangement of a traditional Neapolitan folk song. The album sleeve features one of Martin's paintings, ''Work No. 1674: Anouchka'' and was designed by Andy Knowles, who has recently directed videos for Franz Ferdinand and The Cribs. Martin Creed is also much loved by [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] - regular attendees at his gigs and co-producers on his album 'Mind Trap' -  as well as Moshi Moshi label-mates Slow Club.\n\nA new body of audiovisual work was released in late November 2015 in response to the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]]. The double A-side single \u201cLet Them In / Border Control\u201d was made available via Telephone Records as free downloads on Soundcloud. Both songs are accompanied by videos which Creed made himself.\n\nIn July 2016, Martin Creed released a new album entitled ''Thoughts Lined Up''. The album includes the singles \"Understanding\" and \"Princess Taxi Girl\" for which accompanying videos have been released.\n\n=== Discography ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Type\n!Date\n!Format\n!Label\n|-\n|What The Fuck Am I Doing?\n|Single\n|2017\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Blow And Suck\n|Single\n|2017\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|It's You\n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Princess Taxi Girl\n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thoughts Lined Up\n|Album\n|2016\n|CD, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Understanding \n|Single\n|2016\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Let Them In / Border Control\n|Double A-Side Single\n|2015\n|Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Mind Trap\n|Album\n|2014\n|CD, 12\" Vinyl, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Blow And Suck / I Want You\n|Single\n|2013\n|Special Edition 12\" Vinyl\n|The Vinyl Factory\n|-\n|Chicago\n|EP\n|2012\n|Special Edition 12\" Vinyl\n|Telephone Records / The Vinyl Factory / MCA Chicago\n|-\n|You're The One For Me\n|Single\n|2012\n|Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Love To You\n|Album\n|2012\n|CD, 12\" Vinyl, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Fuck Off / Die\n|Double A-Side Single\n|2012\n|Digital\n|Moshi Moshi Records\n|-\n|Where You Go\n|Split Single\n|2012\n|CD & DVD, Special Edition 12\" Vinyl, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thinking / Not Thinking\n|Single\n|2011\n|CD & DVD, Digital\n|Telephone Records\n|-\n|Thinking / Not Thinking / Words\n|Single\n|2009\n|7\" Vinyl\n|In collaboration with Hiromi Yoshii, Japan\n|-\n|Work No. 815\n|Single\n|2008\n|7\" Vinyl\n|Smart Guy Records\n|-\n|I Can't Move\n|EP\n|2000\n|CD\n|Art Metropole, Canada\n|-\n|EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT\n|Single\n|1999\n|CD\n|Pier Trust\n|-\n|Nothing (Owada)\n|Album\n|1997\n|CD\n|Piano\n|}\n\n===On art===\n\nIn an interview published in the book ''Art Now: Interviews with Modern Artists'' (2002), Creed explains that he used to 'make paintings' but never liked having to decide what to paint. He decided to stop making paintings and instead to think about what it meant, and why he wanted to make things. He says:\n\n{{cquote|The only thing I feel like I know is that I want to make things. Other than that, I feel like I don\u2019t know. So the problem is in trying to make something without knowing what I want. [...] I think it\u2019s all to do with ''wanting'' to communicate. I mean, I think I want to make things because I want to communicate with people, because I want to be loved, because I want to express myself.}}\n\nCreed says that he makes art works not as part of an academic exploration of 'conceptual' art, but rather from a wish to connect with people, 'wanting to communicate and wanting to say hello'. The work is therefore primarily [[emotion]]al:\n\n{{cquote|To me it\u2019s emotional. Aye. To me that\u2019s the starting point. I mean, I do it because I want to make something. I think that\u2019s a desire, you know, or a need. I think that I recognise that I want to make something, and so I try to make something. But then you get to thinking about it and that\u2019s where the problems start because you can\u2019t help thinking about it, wondering whether it\u2019s good or bad. But to me it\u2019s emotional more than anything else.}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\nIn 1996, [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and Roger Ackling selected Creed to exhibit at [[EASTinternational]]. In the decade since winning the Turner Prize he has exhibited extensively throughout the world, including large survey shows at Trussardi Foundation, Milan ('I Like Things'), [[Bard College]], New York ('Feelings'), and a touring exhibition which started at [[Ikon Gallery]] Birmingham and toured to Hiroshima and Seoul.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe first major survey show of Creed's, 'What's the point of it?', took place at the Hayward Gallery, London, in January 2014. The exhibition included a number of his best-known works, from the installation ''Work No. 227 The Lights Going On and Off'' (2000), ''Work No. 293 A sheet of paper crumpled into a ball'' (2003), to his epic sculpture ''Work No. 1092 MOTHERS'' (2011). Coinciding with the exhibition at the Hayward, the [[Southbank Centre]] commissioned Martin to compose a new piece for the Royal Festival Hall organ, resulting in ''Work No''. ''1815,'' a performance alongside some of J.S Bach's greatest organ works.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nCreed's largest survey show to date took place at Park Avenue Armory, New York from June - August 2016, curated by Tom Eccles and Hans-Ulrich Obrist.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Ella, his mother, enters and they begin to discuss the events of the night before that lead to Wesley's father, Weston, breaking down the door. Wesley begins a monologue narrating exactly what he saw and heard happen from the night before. Wesley then leaves and Ella begins to give a motherly talk on what happens during menstruation and what cannot be done during the cycle. Ella is on stage alone for the beginning of the talk, but her daughter, Emma, walks on stage mid-talk and joins the conversation as though she has been there all along. Ella then asks Emma what she is holding and Emma reminds her that these are her poster for the 4-H project on how to properly cut up a frying chicken that she has been working on quite some time. Emma goes to the refrigerator and begins to look for her chicken. Ella begins to act antsy and Emma realizes that Ella has boiled her chicken. Emma begins a rant about how she raised the chicken and hand fed it every day, then killed and cleaned it and her mother has gone and boiled it. Ella tries to feign innocence and Emma storms out. Wesley enters and decides that Emma's project is pointless and that she ought to focus on more important things. Emma returns, still furious, and the three begin an argument about the starving class and whether or not they are part of it. During their argument, Wesley goes to Emma's posters and begins to urinate on them. Ella points this out to Emma and Emma storms off, insisting that she is going to take the horse and run away. Ella tells Emma that the horse is crazy and that she is too young to leave home but Emma refuses to listen.\n\nElla tries to get Wesley to go down and stop Emma from taking the horse. Wesley refuses to stop Emma, and Ella begins to tell him about her plans to sell the house. Wesley is not happy with his mother's decision, and she continues to try and ask him to go stop Emma. Wesley still refuses to go after his sister, and Ella tells him that she is planning to use the money from the house to go to Europe and that he and Emma can come if they want. When Wesley tells her that there will not be enough money from the house to move to Europe Ella gets angry that Wesley is ruining her dream. Wesley then leaves and Emma returns, covered in mud after being thrown from the horse and dragged through the mud. Ella does not tell Emma that she plans to sell the house, but Emma tells Ella that she dreams of moving to Mexico and becoming a mechanic.\n\nElla goes to the back part of the house and Emma goes to the refrigerator. Emma asks the refrigerator why it doesn't have any food because they aren't part of the starving class. She reassures the refrigerator that soon there will be little eggs, butter, and other foods tucked away inside of it. She then becomes angry with the refrigerator and slams it shut. When she turns around she finds that there is a man standing in the room with her. The man tells her that he was going to knock but that there was no door. Emma explains that her father broke the door down the night before in a drunken rage. The man tells her that his name is Taylor and that he is looking for her mother. She wants to know what he wants her mother for and he tells her that he is in the real-estate business and is helping her mother sell the house. Emma is enraged that her mother is selling the house and Taylor tries to convince her that selling the property is in their best interest. Emma tells Taylor that her family has violent tendencies caused by some family members having nitroglycerin, which is a very explosive element, in their blood.\n\nWesley then enters and sets up a small enclosure in the kitchen. He exits again and returns with a lamb, which he puts in the enclosure. Ella finally enters and says that she is going on a business luncheon with Taylor. Emma yells at Ella and exits. Ella leaves with Taylor, telling Wesley to take the lamb with the maggots back outside.\n\nWeston enters, drunk, with a large bag of groceries. Weston talks to the lamb briefly, and then begins putting the groceries, which turn out to only be desert artichokes, in the refrigerator. Wesley enters and they discuss Weston's laundry and the best way to help the lamb with the maggots.\n\n=== Act II ===\n\nAct two opens on Wesley and Emma in the kitchen, where Wesley is building a new front door for the house. Emma and Wesley discuss whether their mother will come back, or whether she will run off to Mexico with Taylor. Wesley and Emma then argue over who is going to go add water to the artichokes that are boiling on the stove. Wesley does not want to do it because he is making the door and Emma doesn't want to do it because she is remaking her posters. Wesley says that Emma doesn't want to do it just because she is \u201con the rag\u201d, so she throws down her markers and gets up to add the water.\n\nWesley then explains to Emma that it is not typical homebuyers who are going to purchase the house, but that it is land developers. He compares it to a zombie invasion and takeover, where the zombies build their own city. He then suggests that they move away to some place safe, like Alaska.\n\nWeston enters, even drunker than he was before. Emma is frightened by him, but Wesley tells her to stay calm. Weston asks where Ella is, and then goes into a rage when Wesley and Emma tell him where she went. Weston then tells them that he has already found someone who will buy the land and pay in cash. Emma, angry, leaves. Weston begins to tell Wesley about how he began to see the \u2018poison\u2019 in his own father, and how Wesley can see it in him. Weston tries to explain the poison to Wesley by comparing it to the way to you poison a coyote by putting strychnine in the belly of a dead lamb.\n\nWesley then tells Weston that Ella has also found a buyer for the house and Weston goes into a rage, and then collapses on a table and falls asleep. Ella returns with groceries that Taylor has bought for the family and throws out the artichokes. Wesley deduces that Taylor is the one who sold Weston worthless desert property in the first place. Ella talks about the curse that is plaguing their family. She tells Wesley that just when you think the curse has been beaten, and it has retreated back into the smallest cells of their genetics, it will suddenly reappear in full force.\n\nEllis, the owner of the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d walks into the house and sees Weston on the table. He tells Wesley and Emma that he has already purchased the house from Weston and shows them the cash. He pulls out the $1,500, telling them that is the amount that Weston owes to some \u201cpretty hard fellas\u201d. Wesley takes the money, offering to deliver it to the people his father owes money to. Ella tries to take the money from Wesley, but he tells her there is not enough to go to Europe on. Taylor then enters and Ella tells him what is happened. Taylor says that any deal Weston makes is void because he is considered incompetent by the state. Taylor declares that he will go to court and have the deed taken back and then buy the property from Ella, then leaves the house.\n\nSergeant Malcolm from the police department enters and tells Ella that Emma has been arrested for riding a horse into the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d and shooting the place full of holes. Ellis says that Weston must have sent Emma down there and takes back his $1,500 and runs off to his club, swearing he will get revenge on Weston. Ella goes downtown to get Emma out of jail.\n\n=== Act III ===\n\nThis act opens with Weston, who is now clean, and sober. He has done his laundry, which is all nicely folded on the table, and the lamb is back in the kitchen. He tells the lamb a story about an eagle who was diving very close down to the ground trying to steal the testes of the lambs he was castrating. In the end he was cheering for the eagle. Wesley, who has been listening to this story, then asks what happens next. Weston becomes grumpy and refuses to tell the rest of the story. He asks what happened to Wesley, who had clearly been beaten up. Wesley tells him that he ran into a brick wall.\n\nWeston tells Wesley that he has decided to stay and fix up the house instead of leaving, no matter who holds the deed. Weston says that when he woke up that morning, after sleeping on the table, that he felt like a new man and walked around their property naked to reclaim ownership. He then came inside and took a bath, made a big breakfast, drank some coffee, and did everyone's laundry. He tells Wesley to go clean up, and he'll make him a big breakfast. While Wesley is bathing, Weston yells in to him that he agrees to become an avocado grower for the Grower's Association.\n\nElla enters and she and Weston discuss Emma's shooting up of the club. Weston is proud of Emma, saying that it takes guts to do something like that at her age. Ella begins to yell at Weston for pulling a Jekyll and Hyde act by changing overnight. He tells her it was the night's sleep on the table that fixed everything. Ella pushes all the laundry to the floor and lies on the table. As she is falling asleep, and Weston is talking to her about the benefits of sleeping on the hard table, Wesley walks into the kitchen, naked, and takes the lamb outside.\n\nWesley re-enters, wearing his father's old clothes. He tells Weston that he has butchered the lamb for food. Weston yells at him, telling him that they didn't need the food, because the refrigerator is full for once. Wesley then begins to gorge himself on all of the food in the refrigerator. Weston tries to calm Wesley down, and to wake Ella up, but cannot seem to do either. He declares to them that he is a whole new person, and Wesley, finally stopped eating, tells Weston that the men who are after him are going to kill him. At first, Weston can't remember who all he has loaned money to, and begins to rant about how this is his home and nobody ought to be able to take it from him because he has nowhere else to go. Wesley tells him to take the Packard and escape to Mexico. Weston leaves.\n\nEmma enters, carrying her riding crop. She asks Wesley why he is wearing their father's clothes. He tells her that as he put them on he could feel his own essence slipping out of him, and his father's essence coming into him. Wesley asks her how she got out of jail and she tells him that she made sexual overtures at the guard. She then pulls out a wad of cash and tells him that she's taking their mother's car and going into crime. As she leaves, Ella wakes up, mistakes Wesley for Weston, and tells him to go after Emma because she's too young to leave on her own. Weston tells Ella to let Emma go and then there is a bright flash and a loud explosion from outside. Emerson, a small well dressed thug, enters giggling about the explosion. His partner, Slater, enters after him, playing with the skinned lamb carcass. Since Ella is still under the impression that Wesley is Weston, Emerson and Slater also mistake Wesley for Weston. Wesley tries to tell them that Weston is his father. They tell him that they have blown up the car, with Emma in the car. The men tell Wesley, who they are still calling Weston, that he is to pass on the warning to his father and they leave.\n\nElla believes that Emma has left on the horse, and is not overly concerned about her. Looking at the lamb carcass, she asks Wesley to help her remember the story Weston always told about the eagle. They finish the story, saying that a tom cat had come to sniff around in the testes and the eagle picked it up. The tom cat and the eagle start fighting in midair, with the cat clawing out the eagle's chest, and the eagle trying to drop it. However, the tom cat won't let go because if it does it will fall and die. Instead, it chooses to bring the eagle down, even if it means certain doom for the cat as well.\n\nThe play ends with Ella and Wesley staring at the lamb carcass.\n\n== Character summaries ==\nThe Tate family is a [[lower middle class]], rural [[California]] family, trying to hold on to the last shreds of a family bond and traditional living.\n\n'''Wesley Tate''' is the son of the family. Feeling strong ties to his family and to the land, Wesley maintains the farm after the others have given up. The prospect of selling the land to real estate developers has a significance far greater than the loss of a mere house, but his family. At times, Wesley loses patience with his family members, as evidenced by his lack of sympathy for his sister's ruined 4-H project, to which he responds by urinating on her charts and suggesting that his sister do something truly useful with her time.\n\n'''Ella Tate''' is the mother of the family. As the play opens, she and Wesley are both looking through the chunks of the broken door that her husband, Weston, broke in a fit of rage. Ella is a highly dysfunctional individual with no capacity to cope with her husband's alcoholism. She often changes topics when she feels it in her best interest and tries to ignore the things going on immediately around her. Ella decides to take matters into her own hands and puts the house up for sale without consulting her husband.\n\n'''Emma Tate''' is the daughter of Ella and Weston Tate. She has just started her first period, and has several mood swings during the play. Emma hates living with her family and repeatedly announces plans to leave home. She first tries to run away by taking the family horse, but it throws her off and drags her through the mud, so she comes back. Later, she becomes so angry about Ellis buying their house, she rides the family horse into his bar and shoots the place full of holes. Once she is arrested she says that she gains her freedom by offering sexual bribes to the sheriff. She then decides to steal her mother's car and take up a life of crime, claiming that it is the only way to make a real living in this world. In her attempt to steal the car, she is blown up with the car by the bomb that Slater puts in it.\n\n'''Ellis''' is the owner of a bar, the Alibi Club, where Weston spends his time when he is not at home. Ellis is a greedy charlatan who tries to cheat the family out of their house. Ellis represents the greed and controlling nature of business owners and the tendency of these people to take unfair advantage of each other and people below them.\n\n'''Emerson''' is a minor character who represents the men that Weston is in debt to. He and Slater, another minor character, only appear at the end of the production when they blow up Weston's car for compensation. He is a wicked man, a villain in the story.\n\n'''Weston Tate''' is the father of the family and an abusive alcoholic. Incapable of driving or holding a job, he is a profoundly unstable man controlled by the alcohol that runs in his system. His violent nature and utter lack of accountability are the crux of many of the family's issues. He is easily taken advantage of and when his debts are not paid, it takes an even more terrifying toll on the people close to him.\n\n'''Sergeant Malcom''' is the police officer who arrives at the house to inform Ella that Emma has been arrested for riding a horse into the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d and shooting it up. He is uninterested in the other crimes that Wesley and Ella accuse Taylor and Ellis of, stating that he is only there to tell Ella about Emma.\n\n'''Taylor''' is a lawyer who is involved in real estate and is looking to buy the property from Ella. He is the representative for several large corporations that are looking to buy up land. He is also the same man who swindled Weston into buying the useless desert property.\n\n'''Slater''' is Emerson's accomplice. He is the one who actually put the bomb in the car that kills Emma. He and Emerson represent the men that Weston owes money to, and have come to serve as a warning. Slater also brings the dead lamb's carcass into the house.\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nA 1994 film version stars [[James Woods]] (Weston), [[Kathy Bates]] (Ella), [[Henry Thomas]] (Wesley), [[Randy Quaid]] (Taylor), and [[Jim Fitzpatrick (actor)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] (Emerson).

She reassures the refrigerator that soon there will be little eggs, butter, and other foods tucked away inside of it. She then becomes angry with the refrigerator and slams it shut. When she turns around she finds that there is a man standing in the room with her. The man tells her that he was going to knock but that there was no door. Emma explains that her father broke the door down the night before in a drunken rage. The man tells her that his name is Taylor and that he is looking for her mother. She wants to know what he wants her mother for and he tells her that he is in the real-estate business and is helping her mother sell the house. Emma is enraged that her mother is selling the house and Taylor tries to convince her that selling the property is in their best interest. Emma tells Taylor that her family has violent tendencies caused by some family members having nitroglycerin, which is a very explosive element, in their blood.\n\nWesley then enters and sets up a small enclosure in the kitchen. He exits again and returns with a lamb, which he puts in the enclosure. Ella finally enters and says that she is going on a business luncheon with Taylor. Emma yells at Ella and exits. Ella leaves with Taylor, telling Wesley to take the lamb with the maggots back outside.\n\nWeston enters, drunk, with a large bag of groceries. Weston talks to the lamb briefly, and then begins putting the groceries, which turn out to only be desert artichokes, in the refrigerator. Wesley enters and they discuss Weston's laundry and the best way to help the lamb with the maggots.\n\n=== Act II ===\n\nAct two opens on Wesley and Emma in the kitchen, where Wesley is building a new front door for the house. Emma and Wesley discuss whether their mother will come back, or whether she will run off to Mexico with Taylor. Wesley and Emma then argue over who is going to go add water to the artichokes that are boiling on the stove. Wesley doesn't want to do it because he is making the door and Emma doesn't want to do it because she is remaking her posters. Wesley says that Emma doesn't want to do it just because she's \u201con the rag\u201d, so she throws down her markers and gets up to add the water.\n\nWesley then explains to Emma that it's not typical homebuyers who are going to purchase the house, but that it's land developers. He compares it to a zombie invasion and takeover, where the zombies build their own city. He then suggests that they move away to some place safe, like Alaska.\n\nWeston enters, even drunker than he was before. Emma is frightened by him, but Wesley tells her to stay calm. Weston asks where Ella is, and then goes into a rage when Wesley and Emma tell him where she went. Weston then tells them that he's already found someone who will buy the land and pay in cash. Emma, angry, leaves. Weston begins to tell Wesley about how he began to see the \u2018poison\u2019 in his own father, and how Wesley can see it in him. Weston tries to explain the poison to Wesley by comparing it to the way to you poison a coyote by putting strychnine in the belly of a dead lamb.\n\nWesley then tells Weston that Ella has also found a buyer for the house and Weston goes into a rage, and then collapses on a table and falls asleep. Ella returns with groceries that Taylor has bought for the family and throws out the artichokes. Wesley deduces that Taylor is the one who sold Weston worthless desert property in the first place. Ella talks about the curse that is plaguing their family. She tells Wesley that just when you think the curse has been beaten, and it has retreated back into the smallest cells of their genetics, it will suddenly reappear in full force.\n\nEllis, the owner of the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d walks into the house and sees Weston on the table. He tells Wesley and Emma that he has already purchased the house from Weston and shows them the cash. He pulls out the $1,500, telling them that is the amount that Weston owes to some \u201cpretty hard fellas\u201d. Wesley takes the money, offering to deliver it to the people his father owes money to. Ella tries to take the money from Wesley, but he tells her there's not enough to go to Europe on. Taylor then enters and Ella tells him what's happened. Taylor says that any deal Weston makes is void because he is considered incompetent by the state. Taylor declares that he will go to court and have the deed taken back and then buy the property from Ella, then leaves the house.\n\nSergeant Malcolm from the police department enters and tells Ella that Emma has been arrested for riding a horse into the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d and shooting the place full of holes. Ellis says that Weston must have sent Emma down there and takes back his $1,500 and runs off to his club, swearing he will get revenge on Weston. Ella goes downtown to get Emma out of jail.\n\n=== Act III ===\n\nThis act opens with Weston, who is now clean, and sober. He has done his laundry, which is all nicely folded on the table, and the lamb is back in the kitchen. He tells the lamb a story about an eagle who was diving very close down to the ground trying to steal the testes of the lambs he was castrating. In the end he was cheering for the eagle. Wesley, who has been listening to this story, then asks what happens next. Weston becomes grumpy and refuses to tell the rest of the story. He asks what happened to Wesley, who had clearly been beaten up. Wesley tells him that he ran into a brick wall.\n\nWeston tells Wesley that he has decided to stay and fix up the house instead of leaving, no matter who holds the deed. Weston says that when he woke up that morning, after sleeping on the table, that he felt like a new man and walked around their property naked to reclaim ownership. He then came inside and took a bath, made a big breakfast, drank some coffee, and did everyone's laundry. He tells Wesley to go clean up, and he'll make him a big breakfast. While Wesley is bathing, Weston yells in to him that he agrees to become an avocado grower for the Grower's Association.\n\nElla enters and she and Weston discuss Emma's shooting up of the club. Weston is proud of Emma, saying that it takes guts to do something like that at her age. Ella begins to yell at Weston for pulling a Jekyll and Hyde act by changing overnight. He tells her it was the night's sleep on the table that fixed everything. Ella pushes all the laundry to the floor and lies on the table. As she is falling asleep, and Weston is talking to her about the benefits of sleeping on the hard table, Wesley walks into the kitchen, naked, and takes the lamb outside.\n\nWesley re-enters, wearing his father's old clothes. He tells Weston that he has butchered the lamb for food. Weston yells at him, telling him that they didn't need the food, because the refrigerator is full for once. Wesley then begins to gorge himself on all of the food in the refrigerator. Weston tries to calm Wesley down, and to wake Ella up, but cannot seem to do either. He declares to them that he is a whole new person, and Wesley, finally stopped eating, tells Weston that the men who are after him are going to kill him. At first, Weston can't remember who all he has loaned money to, and begins to rant about how this is his home and nobody ought to be able to take it from him because he has nowhere else to go. Wesley tells him to take the Packard and escape to Mexico. Weston leaves.\n\nEmma enters, carrying her riding crop. She asks Wesley why he is wearing their father's clothes. He tells her that as he put them on he could feel his own essence slipping out of him, and his father's essence coming into him. Wesley asks her how she got out of jail and she tells him that she made sexual overtures at the guard. She then pulls out a wad of cash and tells him that she's taking their mother's car and going into crime. As she leaves, Ella wakes up, mistakes Wesley for Weston, and tells him to go after Emma because she's too young to leave on her own. Weston tells Ella to let Emma go and then there is a bright flash and a loud explosion from outside. Emerson, a small well dressed thug, enters giggling about the explosion. His partner, Slater, enters after him, playing with the skinned lamb carcass. Since Ella is still under the impression that Wesley is Weston, Emerson and Slater also mistake Wesley for Weston. Wesley tries to tell them that Weston is his father. They tell him that they have blown up the car, with Emma in the car. The men tell Wesley, who they are still calling Weston, that he is to pass on the warning to his father and they leave.\n\nElla believes that Emma has left on the horse, and is not overly concerned about her. Looking at the lamb carcass, she asks Wesley to help her remember the story Weston always told about the eagle. They finish the story, saying that a tom cat had come to sniff around in the testes and the eagle picked it up. The tom cat and the eagle start fighting in midair, with the cat clawing out the eagle's chest, and the eagle trying to drop it. However, the tom cat won't let go because if it does it will fall and die. Instead, it chooses to bring the eagle down, even if it means certain doom for the cat as well.\n\nThe play ends with Ella and Wesley staring at the lamb carcass.\n\n== Character summaries ==\nThe Tate family is a [[lower middle class]], rural [[California]] family, trying to hold on to the last shreds of a family bond and traditional living.\n\n'''Wesley Tate''' is the son of the family. Feeling strong ties to his family and to the land, Wesley maintains the farm after the others have given up. The prospect of selling the land to real estate developers has a significance far greater than the loss of a mere house, but his family. At times, Wesley loses patience with his family members, as evidenced by his lack of sympathy for his sister's ruined 4-H project, to which he responds by urinating on her charts and suggesting that his sister do something truly useful with her time.\n\n'''Ella Tate''' is the mother of the family. As the play opens, she and Wesley are both looking through the chunks of the broken door that her husband, Weston, broke in a fit of rage. Ella is a highly dysfunctional individual with no capacity to cope with her husband's alcoholism. She often changes topics when she feels it in her best interest and tries to ignore the things going on immediately around her. Ella decides to take matters into her own hands and puts the house up for sale without consulting her husband.\n\n'''Emma Tate''' is the daughter of Ella and Weston Tate. She has just started her first period, and has several mood swings during the play. Emma hates living with her family and repeatedly announces plans to leave home. She first tries to run away by taking the family horse, but it throws her off and drags her through the mud, so she comes back. Later, she becomes so angry about Ellis buying their house, she rides the family horse into his bar and shoots the place full of holes. Once she is arrested she says that she gains her freedom by offering sexual bribes to the sheriff. She then decides to steal her mother's car and take up a life of crime, claiming that it is the only way to make a real living in this world. In her attempt to steal the car, she is blown up with the car by the bomb that Slater puts in it.\n\n'''Ellis''' is the owner of a bar, the Alibi Club, where Weston spends his time when he is not at home. Ellis is a greedy charlatan who tries to cheat the family out of their house. Ellis represents the greed and controlling nature of business owners and the tendency of these people to take unfair advantage of each other and people below them.\n\n'''Emerson''' is a minor character who represents the men that Weston is in debt to. He and Slater, another minor character, only appear at the end of the production when they blow up Weston's car for compensation. He is a wicked man, a villain in the story.\n\n'''Weston Tate''' is the father of the family and an abusive alcoholic. Incapable of driving or holding a job, he is a profoundly unstable man controlled by the alcohol that runs in his system. His violent nature and utter lack of accountability are the crux of many of the family's issues. He is easily taken advantage of and when his debts are not paid, it takes an even more terrifying toll on the people close to him.\n\n'''Sergeant Malcom''' is the police officer who arrives at the house to inform Ella that Emma has been arrested for riding a horse into the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d and shooting it up. He is uninterested in the other crimes that Wesley and Ella accuse Taylor and Ellis of, stating that he is only there to tell Ella about Emma.\n\n'''Taylor''' is a lawyer who is involved in real estate and is looking to buy the property from Ella. He is the representative for several large corporations that are looking to buy up land. He is also the same man who swindled Weston into buying the useless desert property.\n\n'''Slater''' is Emerson's accomplice. He is the one who actually put the bomb in the car that kills Emma. He and Emerson represent the men that Weston owes money to, and have come to serve as a warning. Slater also brings the dead lamb's carcass into the house.\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nA 1994 film version stars [[James Woods]] (Weston), [[Kathy Bates]] (Ella), [[Henry Thomas]] (Wesley), [[Randy Quaid]] (Taylor), and [[Jim Fitzpatrick (actor)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] (Emerson).

It follows the intertwining lives of three [[Chicano]] relatives from 1972 to 1984. They start out as members of a [[street gang]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and as dramatic incidents occur, their lives and friendships are forever changed. ''Blood In Blood Out'' was filmed in 1991 throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of Los Angeles and inside California's [[San Quentin State Prison]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=July 2018}}\nMiklo is a man of Mexican and White American ethnicity who grew up in El Pico Aliso [[barrio]] in east Los Angeles. Upon moving back home from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], Miklo goes to stay with his two cousins Paco and Cruz. Miklo tells Cruz that he wants to join their gang ''Vatos Locos''. While Paco is initially skeptical, Miklo later proves himself when he performs an attack on a rival gang, ''Tres Puntos''. Afterwards he is made a member of ''Vatos Locos''.\n\nHowever, the ''Tres Puntos'' gang soon takes revenge by brutally attacking Cruz who is a budding artist, and damages his back for life. When ''Vatos Locos'' learn of the attack, they perform a well-planned counterattack. However, things go wrong when Miklo ends up getting shot by their rival gang's leader, \"Spider\". Miklo is able to shoot and kill Spider, but has to be rushed to the hospital by Paco while being chased by police. Paco crashes into another car at the [[El Pino (The Pine Tree)|El Pino tree]] and they are both arrested.\n\nFrom here, the trio's paths diverge: Miklo is sent to [[San Quentin State Prison]] for murder, Paco volunteers for military service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as an alternative choice to prison, and Cruz continues his passion for art. He also becomes a [[heroin]] addict due to the recurring back pain. His addiction leads to him being disowned by his family after his 12-year-old brother, Juanito, sees Cruz's needle next to him while he is passed out and naively decides to inject himself with it and dies from an overdose.  Paco becomes an [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] police officer after leaving the Marine Corps.\n\nMiklo finds trouble adapting to prison life. The prison is run by three [[prison gang]]s, all of whom are based on their racial backgrounds. The ''Black Guerrilla Army'' (B.G.A.) is led by \"Bonafide\", the ''Aryan Vanguard'' is led by \"Red Ryder\", and ''La Onda'' is led by Montana Segura. ''La Onda''{{'}}s members do not initially accept Miklo and one of them, Popeye, tries to rape Miklo at knife-point, but is stopped by Montana (although Montana stops Popeye not out of concern for Miklo, but because he finds Popeye's intentions as dishonorable to ''La Onda''). After meeting Montana, he is told the only way into ''La Onda'' is killing an enemy inmate, in Miklo's case a white inmate named Big Al who runs the gambling in San Quentin. After gaining Big Al's trust, Miklo stabs him to death during a sexual encounter in the prison kitchen. Miklo is initiated into ''La Onda'', is later promoted to its Ruling Council, and is granted parole after serving nine years in prison.\n\nOn the outside, Miklo is disgusted by his menial job on which his supervisor is extorting money from him, so he joins in an armed robbery. The heist goes poorly and Miklo is intercepted by Paco, now a decorated cop. Miklo tries to run away, but Paco shoots him in the leg, which later has to be amputated. Miklo is sent back to prison where he notices the cocaine addictions of several inmates. ''Onda'' Council Member Carlos has entered the cocaine trade and is competing with the ''B.G.A.'' for customers. The ''Aryan Vanguard'' want to partner with Carlos in the cocaine business by becoming his new supplier. In return, Carlos moves on the ''B.G.A.'' and take them out of the cocaine business. Montana, however, is fiercely against allowing ''La Onda'' to enter the drug trade, saying that drugs will destroy ''La Onda'' and that the ''Aryan Vanguard'' want to start a war between the Black and Chicano inmates. The other Council members agree with Montana and vote against it. This causes Carlos to leave ''La Onda'' to work with the ''Aryan Vanguard'', causing other members to follow him. Carlos murders a B.G.A. soldier named \"Pockets\" who is running the B.G.A.'s cocaine operation. He also contacts his brother, Smokey, outside of prison to bomb a B.G.A. hangout where they move their drugs. After all of this happens, Carlos' usefulness has come to an end and the ''Aryan Vanguard'' drops their protection of him. The ''B.G.A.'' then takes the opportunity to murder Carlos. Despite his death, Miklo agrees with Carlos's outlook after being convinced by Carlos's old drug supplier.\n\nWith hostility high between the Black and Hispanic inmates, Montana and Bonafide meet in the prison yard. Montana convinces Bonafide to agree to a truce if Montana reaches out to ''La Onda'' leaders in the Folsom and Chino prisons to end the violence. The warden grants Montana special permission to visit the Chino and Folsom prisons and Miklo is left in charge during his absence. Montana is granted a special request, and he gets to stay overnight at Delano penitentiary where he can see his daughter. On the morning of the visit, Montana is stabbed to death outside his cell by a member of the ''B.G.A.''. Believing that the ''Aryan Vanguard'' sent forged orders to the hitman, Paco arranges a peace conference between ''La Onda'' and the ''B.G.A.'' However, Miklo, ''La Onda's'' new leader, manipulates the peace talks in order to build an alliance with the ''B.G.A.'' and they agree to kill the ''Aryan Vanguard'' leaders.\n\nLater, enforcers for ''La Onda'' and the ''B.G.A.'' sweep through the walls of San Quentin, killing the leaders of the ''Aryan Vanguard''. After the killings are done, however, Miklo's men promptly exterminate the ''B.G.A.'' leaders as well. Paco is enraged that his own cousin has played him for a fool and angrily confronts Miklo in the prison visiting room. Paco leaves his cousin in disgust, disowning him forever.\n\nThe members of ''La Onda'' hold a final gathering after the warden vows to split the council up transporting some members to their home states. Miklo plans on using this to expand ''La Onda'' to other states in the South West. Later, Miklo and his cellmate \"Magic\" destroy the mould which they used to send the forged orders to the ''B.G.A.'' hit man to kill Montana. Magic says \"We both loved him, but we did what we had to do for ''La Onda.''\" Back in East Los Angeles, Paco visits one of Cruz's murals after the family re-accepts him to see a portrait of his former life. In a pep talk with Cruz, Paco realizes that by ordering Miklo to go after Spider, Paco is responsible for all of the things that have happened to Miklo. This causes Paco to feel guilty for his actions and ultimately forgive Miklo.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Damian Chapa]] as Miklo Velka\n* [[Jesse Borrego]] as Cruz Candelaria\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Paco Aguilar\n* [[Enrique Castillo]] as Montana Oseguera\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Bonafide\n* [[:de:Victor Rivers|Victor Rivers]] as Magic\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Red Ryder\n* [[Carlos Carrasco (actor)|Carlos Carrasco]] as Popeye\n* [[Theodore Wilson]] as Wallace\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Chuey\n* [[Valente Rodriguez]] as Frankie\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Big Al\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Lightning\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Geronimo\n* [[Victor Mohica]] as Mano\n* [[Luis Contreras]] as Realthing\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Ivan\n* [[Richard Masur]] (''uncredited'') as Prison librarian\n* [[Thomas F.

However, they were all loosely based on actual prison gangs, with the Aryan Vanguard, Black Guerrilla Army and La Onda representing the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], [[Black Guerrilla Family]], and the [[Mexican Mafia]], respectively.\n\nActor [[Theodore Wilson]] died shortly after filming his scenes in the film.\n\nArtist Adan Hernandez was hired to create the paintings the character of Cruz Candelaria was supposed to have painted. All of the paintings that were used in the film were created by him. The mural in the reservoir seen in the film's climax has unfortunately been painted over. Hernandez made a cameo appearance in the film as the drug dealer Gilbert in the art gallery scene.\n\nThe film was shot in and around [[Los Angeles]] and [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] and inside the walls of [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The main character Miklo is sent to San Quentin, where much of the film's plot takes place. Several of the then-inmates appear in the film as extras. In addition, several of the prison staff members also appear as others and some facilitated the production of the film by serving as technical advisors. Many members of the staff were given small lines in the film, with the warden giving an extended cameo in a part that is somewhat integral to the plot. In addition, actor [[Danny Trejo]], who appears in the film as Geronimo, had served time in San Quentin before deciding to become an actor.\n\nIn addition to prison inmates and staff and artist Hernandez, screenwriter and barrio poet [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]] cameos as a prison inmate and member of the La Onda council.\n\nThe film was initially entitled ''Blood in Blood Out'' but was retitled ''Bound by Honor'' before the film's release. Blood in blood out refers to the initiation ritual of having to kill someone to enter a gang and, on the reverse end, not being able to leave the gang unless killed. This is a common initiation in many gangs, including prison gangs, and is also the motto of La Onda in the film. [[Hollywood Pictures]] insisted on the name change as the studio felt that it would incite violence in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. In addition, executives at Hollywood Pictures, a subsidiary of [[Disney]], were cautious about the potential effect the film would have following the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992|1992 LA Riots]] and the attribution given to ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' as a partial cause/inspiration of the riots. Director [[Taylor Hackford]] has stated that he was very unhappy with this decision as the film's message was the exact opposite of the one that the studio feared would be transmitted.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 5.48/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_in_blood_out/ Blood In, Blood Out (Bound by Honor) \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe ''[[TV Guide]]'' review stated \"similarity to [[Edward James Olmos]]' ''[[American Me]]'', in which a tormented drug dealer travels the same route through prison society as Miklo. The principal difference between the two films is that ''Bound By Honor'' is by far the glossier effort, relentlessly picturesque in the seamlessly anesthetized manner of mainstream Hollywood films.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bound By Honor|url = http://www.tvguide.com/movies/bound-by-honor/review/129706/|website = TVGuide.com|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> Film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] for the [[Chicago Reader]] wrote that this \"ugly three-hour snoozefest is apparently supposed to do for [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] [[Chicano]]s what the Godfather movies did for New York [[Sicilian Mafia|mafiosi]]\u2026\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bound by Honor|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/bound-by-honor/Film?oid=1066674|website = Chicago Reader|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] wrote \"The East Los Angeles milieu and some of the characters seem familiar, because some of the same ground was covered by ''American Me''...

It holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 5.48/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_in_blood_out/ Blood In, Blood Out (Bound by Honor) \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe ''[[TV Guide]]'' review stated \"similarity to [[Edward James Olmos]]' ''[[American Me]]'', in which a tormented drug dealer travels the same route through prison society as Miklo. The principal difference between the two films is that ''Bound By Honor'' is by far the glossier effort, relentlessly picturesque in the seamlessly anesthetized manner of mainstream Hollywood films.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bound By Honor|url = http://www.tvguide.com/movies/bound-by-honor/review/129706/|website = TVGuide.com|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> Film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] for the [[Chicago Reader]] wrote that this \"ugly three-hour snoozefest is apparently supposed to do for [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] [[Chicano]]s what the Godfather movies did for New York [[Sicilian Mafia|mafiosi]]\u2026\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bound by Honor|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/bound-by-honor/Film?oid=1066674|website = Chicago Reader|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] wrote \"The East Los Angeles milieu and some of the characters seem familiar, because some of the same ground was covered by ''American Me''...

The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same [[runway]].\n\nUpon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. [[Rescue workers]] were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the [[overwing exits]]. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to [[asphyxiation]] in the post-crash fire.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of [[situational awareness]] by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />{{Rp|vi,76}} The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.\n\n==Accident details==\n\n===Aircraft and crew===\n[[USAir]] Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from [[Syracuse, New York]] making stops at [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], and Los Angeles (LAX), before continuing to San Francisco.<ref name=AAR91-08>{{cite book |url=https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR9108.pdf |title=Aviation Accident Report: Runway Collision of USAir Flight 1493, Boeing 737 and Skywest Flight 5569 Fairchild Metroliner, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1991 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-91/08 |date=October 22, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1}} On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a [[Boeing 737-300]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|388US}}''); after a crew change in Washington,<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|1}} it was under the command of [[pilot in command|Captain]] Colin Shaw, 48, a highly experienced pilot with approximately 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and [[copilot|First Officer]] David Kelly, 32, who had approximately 4,300 total flight hours, including 982 hours on the Boeing 737.<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|82}} Flying into LAX, the aircraft had a total of 89 people on board (83 passengers, 4 flight attendants, and the 2 pilots).{{efn|name=\"count discrepancy footnote\"}}\n\nOn February 1, 1991, [[SkyWest Airlines]] Flight 5569 was operated using a twin-engine [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliner]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|683AV}}'').

The local controller then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway.\n\nWith this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The [[flight progress strip]] for this flight had not yet been given to the local controller by the [[clearance delivery]] controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.\n\nThe USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire.<ref name=airdisastercom/> Large debris from the Metroliner \u2013 including its tail, wings, and right engine \u2013 were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.\n\nThe accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the [[Vancouver Canucks]], who were arriving for an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].<ref name=\"canucks\">{{cite news |title=Flights, Fate and Football: Remembering Flight 180 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |last=Beamish |first=Mike |date=December 9, 2006 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222522/http://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident.<ref name=\"canucks\"/> The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane.<ref name=\"latimescancuks\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-04/sports/sp-447_1_vancouver-canucks |title=Canucks Had Close-Up View of Fatal Airline Crash at LAX |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Springer |first=Steve |date=February 4, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9\u20131, their worst loss of the [[1990\u201391 Vancouver Canucks season|1990\u201391]] season.<ref name=\"canucks\"/>\n\n==Fatalities and injuries==\n[[Image:USAir1493SeatingChart.svg|thumb|right|Seating chart of US Airways Flight 1493 from the NTSB, revealing locations of passengers, lack of injury, the severity of injuries, and deaths.]]\n\nThe 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and one flight attendant).

[[Billionaire]] businessman [[David H. Koch]] was among the survivors.\n\nThe majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries.  Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door.  The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft.  Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.<ref name=AAR91-08/>\n\nFrom the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from [[smoke inhalation]] while making their way to the exits.

She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then \"realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'\"  She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.<ref name=controller>{{cite news |last1=Malnic |first1=Eric |last2=Connell |first2=Rich |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-08/news/mn-1325_1_runway-collision |title=Controller Says Her Error Caused Runway Collision |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 8, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Stein|first=Mark|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-09-mn-656-story.html|title=Controller Was Stricken by Grief, Tears After Crash : Disaster: Co-workers spent hours after the accident counseling her and hid her from publicity for days.|date=1991-02-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights.<ref name=towertapes>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-03-26/news/1991085042_1_skywest-plane-down-the-runway |title=FAA releases tower tapes of the crash on L.A. runway |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |last=Carroll |first=James R. |date=March 26, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence\u2014her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air and ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff.  All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.\n\nAt the time of the accident, air traffic controllers at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a [[Boeing 747]] landing on 24L passed only {{convert|200|ft|m}} above a 737 holding on the same runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20040830X01323&ntsbno=LAX04IA302&akey=1|title=Aircraft Incident Report, B737 and B744 runway incursion, Los Angeles CA, August 19, 2004|date=August 19, 2004|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|id=LAX04IA302}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLAX now prioritizes use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport.\n\nBefore this accident, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year.

The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same [[runway]].\n\nUpon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. [[Rescue workers]] were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the [[overwing exits]]. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to [[asphyxiation]] in the post-crash fire.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of [[situational awareness]] by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />{{Rp|vi,76}} The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.\n\n==Accident details==\n\n===Aircraft and crew===\n[[USAir]] Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from [[Syracuse, New York]] making stops at [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], and Los Angeles (LAX), before continuing to San Francisco.<ref name=AAR91-08>{{cite book |url=https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR9108.pdf |title=Aviation Accident Report: Runway Collision of USAir Flight 1493, Boeing 737 and Skywest Flight 5569 Fairchild Metroliner, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1991 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-91/08 |date=October 22, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1}} On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a [[Boeing 737-300]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|388US}}''); after a crew change in Washington,<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|1}} it was under the command of [[pilot in command|Captain]] Colin Shaw, 48, a highly experienced pilot with approximately 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and [[copilot|First Officer]] David Kelly, 32, who had approximately 4,300 total flight hours, including 982 hours on the Boeing 737.<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|82}} Flying into LAX, the aircraft had a total of 89 people on board (83 passengers, 4 flight attendants, and the 2 pilots).{{efn|name=\"count discrepancy footnote\"}}\n\nOn February 1, 1991, [[SkyWest Airlines]] Flight 5569 was operated using a twin-engine [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliner]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|683AV}}'').

The local controller then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway.\n\nWith this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The [[flight progress strip]] for this flight had not yet been given to the local controller by the [[clearance delivery]] controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.\n\nThe USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire.<ref name=airdisastercom/> Large debris from the Metroliner \u2013 including its tail, wings, and right engine \u2013 were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.\n\nThe accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the [[Vancouver Canucks]], who were arriving for an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].<ref name=\"canucks\">{{cite news |title=Flights, Fate and Football: Remembering Flight 180 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |last=Beamish |first=Mike |date=December 9, 2006 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222522/http://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident.<ref name=\"canucks\"/> The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane.<ref name=\"latimescancuks\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-04/sports/sp-447_1_vancouver-canucks |title=Canucks Had Close-Up View of Fatal Airline Crash at LAX |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Springer |first=Steve |date=February 4, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9\u20131, their worst loss of the [[1990\u201391 Vancouver Canucks season|1990\u201391]] season.<ref name=\"canucks\"/>\n\n==Fatalities and injuries==\n[[Image:USAir1493SeatingChart.svg|thumb|right|Seating chart of US Airways Flight 1493 from the NTSB, revealing locations of passengers, lack of injury, the severity of injuries, and deaths.]]\n\nThe 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and one flight attendant).

[[Billionaire]] businessman [[David H. Koch]] was among the survivors.\n\nThe majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries.  Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door.  The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft.  Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.<ref name=AAR91-08/>\n\nFrom the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from [[smoke inhalation]] while making their way to the exits.

She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then \"realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'\"  She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.<ref name=controller>{{cite news |last1=Malnic |first1=Eric |last2=Connell |first2=Rich |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-08/news/mn-1325_1_runway-collision |title=Controller Says Her Error Caused Runway Collision |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 8, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Stein|first=Mark|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-09-mn-656-story.html|title=Controller Was Stricken by Grief, Tears After Crash : Disaster: Co-workers spent hours after the accident counseling her and hid her from publicity for days.|date=1991-02-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights.<ref name=towertapes>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-03-26/news/1991085042_1_skywest-plane-down-the-runway |title=FAA releases tower tapes of the crash on L.A. runway |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |last=Carroll |first=James R. |date=March 26, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence\u2014her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air and ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff.  All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.\n\nAt the time of the accident, air traffic controllers at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a [[Boeing 747]] landing on 24L passed only {{convert|200|ft|m}} above a 737 holding on the same runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20040830X01323&ntsbno=LAX04IA302&akey=1|title=Aircraft Incident Report, B737 and B744 runway incursion, Los Angeles CA, August 19, 2004|date=August 19, 2004|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|id=LAX04IA302}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLAX now prioritizes use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport.\n\nBefore this accident, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year.
