However, in September 2019, during a joint meeting in Geneva of the European Planetary Science Congress-Division for Planetary Sciences, Chinese presenters announced that two preliminary sites in the [[Utopia Planitia]] region of Mars have instead been chosen for the anticipated landing attempt, with each site having a landing ellipse of approximately 100 by 40 kilometers.<ref name=\"IEEE2019article\"/>\n\nOn January 23, 2020, China Youth Daily reported that, according to sources from [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation|CASC]], the Mars probe will be launched in July 2020 by the [[Long March 5]] Y4 carrier rocket.

was [[warm-blooded]] or [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] has not been settled, although its apparent [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] features would seem to place it in the former group.\n\nHadrocodium are

[[Virgin Group]] founder, [[Richard Branson]] was looking to widen the Virgin name and to rival [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] brands.\n\nVirgin Cola began to hit international shores within its first year. The UK first served the drink on [[Virgin Atlantic]] flights, on-board shops on [[Virgin CrossCountry|Virgin Trains]] and also at [[Virgin Cinemas]].  The [[Gulliver's Kingdom]] chain of theme parks in the UK also sold post mix Virgin cola.

Cott was looking for a major international brand that could have global appeal. [[Virgin Group]] founder, [[Richard Branson]] was looking to widen the Virgin name and to rival [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] brands.\n\nVirgin Cola began to hit international shores within its first year. The UK first served the drink on [[Virgin Atlantic]] flights, on-board shops on [[Virgin CrossCountry|Virgin Trains]] and also at [[Virgin Cinemas]].  The [[Gulliver's Kingdom]] chain of theme parks in the UK also sold post mix Virgin cola. This led Virgin Cola to agree a distribution deal with British supermarket retailer [[Tesco]] in 1994.<ref name=independent161094/>\n \nFrom 1996, the 500 ml bottles were marketed as \"The Pammy\", as their curves were designed to resemble [[Pamela Anderson]] who was at the height of her popularity in the UK at the time.<ref name=independent160296>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Genevieve|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4766439.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513021828/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4766439.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 May 2013|title=Mine's a Coke - no, make that a Pammy|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 February 1996|accessdate=27 November 2012}} {{subscription required |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A553187 |title=h2g2 - Cola Drinks |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> It went on to be launched in France, Belgium and South Africa.<ref name=wp260398>{{cite news|last=Mayer|first=Caroline E.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-639280.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513023905/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-639280.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 May 2013|title=Branson Throws The Cola Biz a Curve; Virgin's CEO Plans U.S. Launch for `Pammy'|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 March 1998|accessdate=27 November 2012}} {{subscription required |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Branson himself attended the USA launch of Virgin Cola, driving a [[tank]] into [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] as part of the launch.<ref name=pt130598>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-10848FA54412E772.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513035233/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-10848FA54412E772.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 May 2013|title=VIRGIN COLA TAKES AIM AT COCA-COLA'S SOFT DRINK STRANGLEHOLD|newspaper=[[Post-Tribune]]|date=13 May 1998|accessdate=27 November 2012}} {{subscription required |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref><ref name=wt290898>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Eric|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-56762413|title=Virgin Cola faces uphill fight: Britain's new No. 3 gears for area push.(Business)|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=29 August 1998|accessdate=27 November 2012}} {{subscription required |via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}</ref> It subsequently agreed distribution channels with US retailers such as [[Target Corporation|Target]].<ref name=wt290898/> Virgin Drinks USA, the company dealing in Virgin Cola's US market, closed in April 2001, having managed to establish just a 0.5% share of the market by volume.<ref name=mw270701>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-78358297.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513111839/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-78358297.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 May 2013|title=Will global markets embrace Virgin?|newspaper=[[Marketing Week]]|date=27 July 2001|accessdate=27 November 2012}} {{subscription required |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a bottle of Virgin Cola can be seen on the coffee table in [[Monica Geller|Monica]] and [[Rachel Green|Rachel]]'s apartment during the 4 February U.S. airing of the ''[[Friends]]'' episode entitled \"The One with Joey's Bag.\" Branson had previously appeared in an episode and was said to be a fan of the show.
