During the same time period plans to expand infrastructure to facilitate greater trade within the Amazon region manifested itself in the building of the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]]. A 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) wide highway would effectively connect the entire Amazon and would create huge opportunities for cattle ranching to expand into previously untouched parts of the forest. Widespread use of [[ethanol]], a cheaper gas, gave cattle ranchers every economic incentive to take maximized profits no matter the environmental repercussions. The cattle industry initially struggled to meet domestic demand but soon became export driven. According to the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), \"between 1990 and 2001 the percentage of Europe's processed meat imports that came from Brazil rose from 40 to 74 percent\" and by 2003 \"for the first time ever, the growth in Brazilian cattle production, 80 percent of which was in the Amazon, was largely export driven.\"<ref>\"Beef Exports Fuel Loss of Amazonian Forest.\" Center for International Forestry Research. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Soybean production===\n\nAfter the [[United States]], [[Brazil]] is the second largest produce of soybeans. Soybean production, like cattle ranching, requires ample land and because of its profitability and importance as an export, receives large governmental support. As stated in the [[Constitution of Brazil]], clearing land for crops or fields is considered an \u2018effective use\u2019 of land and has resulted in massive expansions of infrastructure aimed at providing greater access to unused land. In an effort to address increasing demand of ranching, soybean production and timber, two highways were constructed: the [[Rodovia Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia]] (1958) and the Cuiaba-Porto Velho (1968). These were the only federal highways in the [[Legal Amazon]] to be paved and passable year-round before the late 1990s and contributed greatly to the high rates of deforestation.\n\nWith greater infrastructural support and economic incentive, Brazilian soybean production has skyrocketed. Land clearing for greater mechanized farming now contributes even more extensively to deforestation because of the change in land use. Whereas previously the land was either unused or uninhabited and could function as a CO\u00b2 absorber, mechanized farming could drastically change local climate and effect the rainforest's ability to absorb carbon emissions.<ref>Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforests and CO2.

Large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared to provide for these sectors and the excess timber produced is extremely profitable. The removal of large swaths of trees from this area negatively impacts the environment in significant ways yet only account for trees killed, not necessarily harvested. For example, near Paragominas, Par\u00e1, for every tree harvested, 27 trees have been reported killed or severely damaged.<ref>Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforests and CO2.

Gasoline was heavily favored until the [[1973 oil shock|1973 global oil shock]] made clear Brazil's dangerous dependence on foreign oil.

During the same time period plans to expand infrastructure to facilitate greater trade within the Amazon region manifested itself in the building of the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]]. A 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) wide highway would effectively connect the entire Amazon and would create huge opportunities for cattle ranching to expand into previously untouched parts of the forest. Widespread use of [[ethanol]], a cheaper gas, gave cattle ranchers every economic incentive to take maximized profits no matter the environmental repercussions. The cattle industry initially struggled to meet domestic demand but soon became export driven. According to the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), \"between 1990 and 2001 the percentage of Europe's processed meat imports that came from Brazil rose from 40 to 74 percent\" and by 2003 \"for the first time ever, the growth in Brazilian cattle production, 80 percent of which was in the Amazon, was largely export driven.\"<ref>\"Beef Exports Fuel Loss of Amazonian Forest.\" Center for International Forestry Research. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Soybean production===\n\nAfter the [[United States]], [[Brazil]] is the second largest produce of soybeans. Soybean production, like cattle ranching, requires ample land and because of its profitability and importance as an export, receives large governmental support. As stated in the [[Constitution of Brazil]], clearing land for crops or fields is considered an \u2018effective use\u2019 of land and has resulted in massive expansions of infrastructure aimed at providing greater access to unused land. In an effort to address increasing demand of ranching, soybean production and timber, two highways were constructed: the [[Rodovia Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia]] (1958) and the Cuiaba-Porto Velho (1968). These were the only federal highways in the [[Legal Amazon]] to be paved and passable year-round before the late 1990s and contributed greatly to the high rates of deforestation.\n\nWith greater infrastructural support and economic incentive, Brazilian soybean production has skyrocketed. Land clearing for greater mechanized farming now contributes even more extensively to deforestation because of the change in land use. Whereas previously the land was either unused or uninhabited and could function as a CO\u00b2 absorber, mechanized farming could drastically change local climate and effect the rainforest's ability to absorb carbon emissions.<ref>Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforests and CO2.

Large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared to provide for these sectors and the excess timber produced is extremely profitable.

For example, near Paragominas, Par\u00e1, for every tree harvested, 27 trees have been reported killed or severely damaged.<ref>Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforests and CO2.

Ethanol production peaked during [[World War II]] because German submarines threatened oil supplies and the Brazilian government, in turn, looked for alternative fuel sources. Gasoline was heavily favored until the [[1973 oil shock|1973 global oil shock]] made clear Brazil's dangerous dependence on foreign oil. In response, the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as an alternative fuel. The National Alcohol Program -Pr\u00f3-\u00c1lcool- (Portuguese: 'Programa Nacional do \u00c1lcool'), launched in 1975, was a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels, such as gasoline, in favor of ethanol produced from sugar cane.<ref name=\"Martinelli, Luiz A. 2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Martinelli | first1 = Luiz A. | last2 = Filoso | first2 = Solange | year = 2008 | title = Expansion Of Sugarcane Ethanol Production In Brazil: Environmental And Social Challenges | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 885\u201398 | doi=10.1890/07-1813.1}}</ref> This large-scale shift to ethanol initially focused on the amount of ethanol mixed with gasoline.

For the past four decades, Brazil has taken serious steps to move towards greater [[energy security]] and federal environmental protection by advancing ethanol production as a complement to oil.\n\nBrazil's ethanol fuel program is based on the most efficient method of cultivating sugar cane in the world. Using modern equipment and cheap [[sugar cane]] as feedstock, residual cane-waste ([[bagasse]]) is used to produce heat and power, resulting in competitive prices for energy. The balance of energy, or the input vs. output of energy, is extremely high when using this method and results anywhere from 8.3 (average conditions) and 10.1 (optimum).<ref name=\"MLA_2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eners.ch/plateforme/medias/macedo_2004.pdf |author=Macedo Isaias, M.

The film, based on a Bengali short story by [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], was produced under the banner of  Picture Perfect and has a script by Shyamaprasad himself, cinematography by Alagappan, editing by Vinod Sukumaran and music by [[Ouseppachan]].\n\nThe film, a [[romantic comedy]], is about the shades of love that vary in a relationship woven around three individuals.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells the story of Shanthanu ([[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]]), a researcher in [[linguistics]], and his two friends, Kalpana ([[Samvritha Sunil|Samvritha]]) and Anuradha ([[Mamta Mohandas|Mamtha]]). Anuradha is the sensitive type who has gone through certain bitter experiences in her teenage years, when her cousin approached her with love, which she later realised was just his lust for her. Kalpana is slightly capricious and loves being in love. Anuradha wants to play Cupid and bring Shanthanu and Kalpana together; she knows that they care a lot for each other, but for some reason or other are hesitant to take the next step.\n\nKalpana's parents are against her marrying Shanthanu and they try to bring proposals from their own ([[Brahmin]]) community. At one point Kalpana's aunt tricks her into meeting a guy, Sanjay, whom they hope Kalpana will like and marry. While they travel with Sanjay in his car, they meet with an accident, which causes some scars on Kalpana's face and gave her a disfigured toe. After the accident Kalpana backs out from the relationship with Shanthanu and gives in to her parents' wishes to marry Sanjay. Anuradha feels very bad for Shanthanu and tries to console him. It is then that Shanthanu realizes that Kalpana had actually not loved him at all. Though his actual love was near him, so close, he failed to recognise it (Where the name of this film gets significance).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Shanthanu\n* [[Samvrutha Sunil]] as Kalpana\n* [[Mamta Mohandas]] as Anuradha\n* [[Ajmal Ameer]] as Sanjay Shenoy\n* [[Urmila Unni]] as Alaga Devi, Kalpana's mother\n* [[Vineeth]] as Balu\n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Ananthanarayana Pai, Kalpana's father\n* [[Madampu Kunjukuttan]] as Guruji\n* [[Dinesh Panicker]] as Subramanya Pai\n* [[Valsala Menon]] as Balu's mother\n* Chithra Iyer as Sujatha\n* [[Sreenath Bhasi]] as Anjan\n* [[Prakash Bare]] as Vinayan\n* Chandramohan as Anuradha's father\n* [[Kozhikode Narayanan Nair]] as Balu's father\n\n==Production==\n===Adaptation===\nShyamaprasad has adapted several classics on celluloid so far. ''Arike'' is the latest in that list and is based on a Bengali short story by [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], whose novel was also the base for the director's ''[[Ore Kadal]]''.<ref name=\"The Hindu1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2717028.ece|title=Playing Cupid|author=P.K.Ajith Kumar|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=3 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053013/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2717028.ece|archive-date=24 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Says the director, \"I don\u2019t think adapting stories from other languages is an issue at all, because human emotions are universal and can be told without linguistic barriers.

We have illusions and inhibitions about love, yet we have an irrepressible thirst for it. We all want to find happiness in love. But whether we get that happiness is the question which I want to delve through this film.\"<ref name=\"Express1\"/>\n\nCompared to the dark themes he took up earlier, ''Arike'''s tone is relatively lighter. Shyamaprasad says, \"In ''Ore Kadal'', the subject had an shadow of gloom and depression, ''[[Ritu (2009 film)|Ritu]]'' was about the aspirations and attitude of the young working population. ''Arike''  has a breezy feel, and the story is told in a lighthearted and realistic way. I have also taken efforts to avoid cliches such as rain, sea, train that are common motifs in romantic films.\"<ref name=\"Express1\"/>\n\n===Casting and filming===\nThe film has only a handful of characters. Shyamaprasad wanted to use live sound recording and hence he chose actors who could emote dialogues perfectly while shooting itself.<ref name=\"The Hindu1\"/> Shyamaprasad says he selected Dileep to play the protagonist because he feels the actor has the look and feel of the character.<ref name=\"Express1\"/> This is the first time Shyamaprasad has cast Dileep in a lead role, though the actor had earlier done a role in the director's 1998 film ''[[Kallu Kondoru Pennu]]''.<ref name=\"Screen1\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/shyamaprasads-arike-rolls/893475/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202063208/http://www.screenindia.com/news/shyamaprasads-arike-rolls/893475/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2013 |title=Shyamaprasad\u2019s Arike rolls |author=Unni R.

Shyamaprasad brought in Sohel Sanwari from [[Bollywood]] to record the sound. Says Shyamaprasad, \"This is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. The early talkies had speech recorded live but the change to outdoor locations made carrying recording cameras cumbersome. Added to this was the fact that technicians and stars started travelling and this started the trend of dubbing. I feel that we lose 50 to 60 per cent of the performance when we post-synchronise voices.

''Arike'' is the latest in that list and is based on a Bengali short story by [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], whose novel was also the base for the director's ''[[Ore Kadal]]''.<ref name=\"The Hindu1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2717028.ece|title=Playing Cupid|author=P.K.Ajith Kumar|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=3 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053013/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2717028.ece|archive-date=24 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Says the director, \"I don\u2019t think adapting stories from other languages is an issue at all, because human emotions are universal and can be told without linguistic barriers.

We have illusions and inhibitions about love, yet we have an irrepressible thirst for it. We all want to find happiness in love. But whether we get that happiness is the question which I want to delve through this film.\"<ref name=\"Express1\"/>\n\nCompared to the dark themes he took up earlier, ''Arike'''s tone is relatively lighter. Shyamaprasad says, \"In ''Ore Kadal'', the subject had an shadow of gloom and depression, ''[[Ritu (2009 film)|Ritu]]'' was about the aspirations and attitude of the young working population. ''Arike''  has a breezy feel, and the story is told in a lighthearted and realistic way. I have also taken efforts to avoid cliches such as rain, sea, train that are common motifs in romantic films.\"<ref name=\"Express1\"/>\n\n===Casting and filming===\nThe film has only a handful of characters. Shyamaprasad wanted to use live sound recording and hence he chose actors who could emote dialogues perfectly while shooting itself.<ref name=\"The Hindu1\"/> Shyamaprasad says he selected Dileep to play the protagonist because he feels the actor has the look and feel of the character.<ref name=\"Express1\"/> This is the first time Shyamaprasad has cast Dileep in a lead role, though the actor had earlier done a role in the director's 1998 film ''[[Kallu Kondoru Pennu]]''.<ref name=\"Screen1\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/shyamaprasads-arike-rolls/893475/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202063208/http://www.screenindia.com/news/shyamaprasads-arike-rolls/893475/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2013 |title=Shyamaprasad\u2019s Arike rolls |author=Unni R.

Shyamaprasad brought in Sohel Sanwari from [[Bollywood]] to record the sound. Says Shyamaprasad, \"This is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. The early talkies had speech recorded live but the change to outdoor locations made carrying recording cameras cumbersome. Added to this was the fact that technicians and stars started travelling and this started the trend of dubbing. I feel that we lose 50 to 60 per cent of the performance when we post-synchronise voices. Take for example a scene on the seashore \u2014 our body, voice modulation and mannerisms are in sync with the surroundings.

{"title_page": "List of U.S. executive branch czars", "text_new": "{{update|date=July 2017}}\nIn the United States, [[Czar (political term)|the informal political term \"czar\" or \"tsar\"]] is employed in media and popular usage to refer to high-level officials who oversee a particular policy. There have never been any U.S. government offices with the title \"czar\", but various governmental officials have sometimes been referred to by the nickname \"czar\" rather than their actual title.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term for a U.S. government official was in the administration of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] (1933\u20131945), during which eleven unique positions (or twelve if one were to count \"Economic Czar\" and \"Economic Czar of World War II\" as separate) were so described. The term was revived, mostly by the press, to describe officials in the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administrations and continues today.\n\n== By administration ==\nThe list is subjective and imprecise, since frequently individuals or offices might be referred to by the nickname \"czar\" by some publication or a political opponent, yet the actual governmental official, a majority of publications and others do not use the term. One possible definition is only those officials who are appointed by the president without Senate confirmation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ '''Summary table - Number of czars per administration'''\n|-\n!President's name\n!Party\n!In office\n!Number of <br />czar titles\n!Number of <br />appointees\n!Appointees not <br />confirmed by Senate\n|-\n|Franklin Roosevelt\n|align=center |D\n|1933\u20131945\n|align=center |11\n|align=center |19\n|align=center |18\n|-\n|Harry Truman\n|align=center |D\n|1945\u20131953\n|align=center |6\n|align=center |6\n|align=center |5\n|-\n|Dwight Eisenhower\n|align=center |R\n|1953\u20131961\n|align=center |1\n|align=center |1\n|align=center |0\n|-\n|Lyndon Johnson\n|align=center |D\n|1963\u20131969\n|align=center |3\n|align=center |3\n|align=center |1\n|-\n|Richard Nixon\n|align=center |R\n|1969\u20131974\n|align=center |3\n|align=center |5\n|align=center |5\n|-\n|Gerald Ford\n|align=center |R\n|1974\u20131977\n|align=center |2\n|align=center |2\n|align=center |2\n|-\n|Jimmy Carter\n|align=center |D\n|1977\u20131981\n|align=center |2\n|align=center |3\n|align=center |2\n|-\n|Ronald Reagan\n|align=center |R\n|1981\u20131989\n|align=center |1\n|align=center |1\n|align=center |1\n|-\n|George H.

Please see it for details and references.  Note that what is measured is the popularity of the ''word'' czar, rather than an objective measure of authority.\n\nAlso note that under George W. Bush only 33 Czar titles had been currently found, thus only 33 Czars, although many of these titles were used by several distinct individuals.  For example, there has been an Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health since the passage of the [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], but the phrase \"mine safety czar\" was only applied to the position since the controversial appointment of [[Richard Stickler]] to the post in 2006.  Similarly, there has been a director of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] since the office was created by the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]] of 1980, but the term \"regulatory czar\" was not applied to the post until 2001.\n\n==List of executive branch czars==\nThe following are executive branch officials who have been described by the media as a czar of some kind.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

There have never been any U.S. government offices with the title \"czar\", but various governmental officials have sometimes been referred to by the nickname \"czar\" rather than their actual title.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term for a U.S. government official was in the administration of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] (1933\u20131945), during which eleven unique positions (or twelve if one were to count \"Economic Czar\" and \"Economic Czar of World War II\" as separate) were so described. The term was revived, mostly by the press, to describe officials in the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administrations and continues today.\n\n== By administration ==\nThe list is subjective and imprecise, since frequently individuals or offices might be referred to by the nickname \"czar\" by some publication or a political opponent, yet the actual governmental official, a majority of publications and others do not use the term.

For example, there has been an Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health since the passage of the [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], but the phrase \"mine safety czar\" was only applied to the position since the controversial appointment of [[Richard Stickler]] to the post in 2006.  Similarly, there has been a director of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] since the office was created by the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]] of 1980, but the term \"regulatory czar\" was not applied to the post until 2001.\n\n==List of executive branch czars==\nThe following are executive branch officials who have been described by the media as a czar of some kind.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
