It succeeds the [[Loglan]] project.\n\nThe Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize [[Loglan]]'s purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, \"Lojban: A Realization of Loglan\"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as ''The Complete Lojban Language''. In an interview in 2010 with ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Arika Okrent]], the author of ''In the Land of Invented Languages'', stated: \"The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban\u2014a language created to reflect the principles of logic.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/ |title=Questions Answered: Invented Languages |publisher=The New York Times Schott's Vocab blog}}</ref>\n\nLojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en|title=Welcome!/en - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"{{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] formed from {{lang|jbo|loj}} and {{lang|jbo|ban}}, which are short forms of {{lang|jbo|logji}} (logic) and {{lang|jbo|bangu}} (language).\n\n== History ==\nLojban's predecessor, [[Loglan]], a language invented by [[James Cooke Brown]] in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute, Loglan was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought (an assumption known as the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]]).\n\nAs Brown started to claim his [[copyright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html|title=Why I like Lojban|work=nvg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|title=AI Newsletter|work=ainewsletter.com|access-date=2012-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223111830/http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|archive-date=2011-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> on the language's components, bans were put on the community's activity to stop them changing aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of people decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of Lojban. In effect they established in 1987 The Logical Language Group, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language \"Loglan\".<ref>Johansen, Arnt Richard.

The list of source languages used for the algorithm was limited to the six [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most widely spoken languages]] as of 1987\u2014[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic]].

''The Complete Lojban Language'' (''CLL'', also known as ''The Red Book'' because of its color, and ''The Codex Woldemar'', after its author), the definitive word on all aspects of Lojban, is one of them, finalized in 1997.

[https://lojban.github.io/cll/ The Complete Lojban Language 13.16]</ref>). Also such collective or encyclopedic sources of knowledge like the [[:jbo:|Lojban Wikipedia]], which may help expand the language's lexical horizon, are not very well developed.\n\nPresently accessible Lojbanic writings are principally concentrated on Lojban.org,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/te_gerna_la_lojban|title=te gerna la lojban - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref> though there exist independent Lojbanic blog/journal sites as well.

These available materials on the internet include both original works and translations of classic pieces in the field of natural languages, ranging from [[poetry]], [[short story]], [[novel]], and [[essay|academic writing]]. <!-- This has been paralleled with a [[chrestomathy]] project aiming to produce a collection of translated writings in order to show wide samplings of various language, hopefully longer than {{formatnum:10000}} words and with a variety of genres and styles<ref>Lojban.org [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/official_LLG_Projects Official LLG Projects: Chrestomathy] (accessed August 2007)</ref> (''see also \u2013 External link: Literature''). --> Examples of works that are already available include:\n* ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_selfri_be_la_.alis._bei_bu%27u_la_selmacygu%27e|title=lo selfri be la .alis. bei bu'u la selmacygu'e|website=alis.lojban.org}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_se_manci_te_makfa_pe_la_.oz.|title=lo se manci te makfa pe la .oz. - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Little Prince]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/le_cmalu_noltru|title=le cmalu noltru - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_nu_binxo|title=lo nu binxo - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n* ''[[In a Grove]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_nenri_be_lo_spati_denmi|title=lo nenri be lo spati denmi - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Book of Esther]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Esther|title=Esther - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\nLojban has also been used in other media.

[...] Other areas of possible benefit are (surprisingly in a 'logical' language) emotional expression. Lojban has a fully developed set of metalinguistic and emotional attitude indicators that supplant much of the baggage of aspect and mood found in natural languages, but most clearly separate indicative statements from the emotional communication associated with those statements. This might lead to freer expression and consideration of ideas, since stating an idea can be distinguished from supporting that idea. The set of possible indicators is also large enough to provide specificity and clarity of emotions that is difficult in natural languages.}}\n\n[[John W. Cowan|John Cowan]]:\n\n{{quotation|There is a marker for \"figurative speech\" which would be used on \"back stabber\" and would signal \"There is a culturally dependent construction here!\" The intent is not that everything is instantly and perfectly comprehensible to someone who knows only the root words, but rather that non-root words are built up creatively from the roots. Thus \"heart pain\" would refer to the literal heart and literal pain;\nwhat would be ambiguous would be the exact connection between these two. Is the\npain in the heart, because of the heart, or what? But \"heart pain\" would not be\na valid tanru for \"emotional pain\", absent the figurative speech marker.<ref>[http://www.lojban.org/files/why-lojban/swh.txt ''Computer Network Discussions on Loglan/Lojban and Linguistics: Lojban as seen by the linguistics and cognitive science community'' 20, 23]</ref>}}\n\n{{quotation|The language was built to attempt to remove some limits on human thought; these limits are not understood, so that the tendency is to try to remove restrictions whenever we find the language structure gets in our way.

Some of them have, apart from the preferred/standard sounds, permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.\n\nStress normally falls on the penultimate syllable.\n\nThere are 16 [[diphthong]]s (and no [[triphthong]]s). A distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs can be written by inserting a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates {{IPA|[h]}}, though there are other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of adding vowels between them ([[epenthesis]]), as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.\n\nLojban is written almost entirely with lower-case letters; upper-case letters are used to mark stress in words that do not fit the normal rules of stress assignment, or when whitespace is omitted.\n\nThe letters in Lojban and their respective pronunciations are shown in the table below. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in parentheses indicate alternative pronunciations; preferred pronunciations have no parentheses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lojban consonant phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

II.3'']</ref> Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:\n* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;\n* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.\n\nSuch standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:\n\n{{quotation\n|It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.<br /><br />Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. '[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}\n\nThe computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.\n\nIts [[Linguistic typology|typology]] can be said to be basically [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] and [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. However, it can practically be anything:\n* {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} (SVO) (I love you)\n* {{lang|jbo|mi do prami}} (SOV) (By me, you are loved)\n* {{lang|jbo|do se prami mi}} (OVS) (You are loved by me)\n* {{lang|jbo|do mi se prami}} (OSV) (You, I love)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami fa mi do}} (VSO) (Loved by me, you are)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami do fa mi}}, {{lang|jbo|se prami fa do mi}} (VOS) (Love you, I do)\n\nSuch flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} is determined by {{lang|jbo|prami}} realizing, with its own predefined \"place structure\", a specific semantic relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}}; when the positional relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}} changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.\n\nAs befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, another reason why the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.\n\nMultiple predicate words may be linked up together so as to narrow the semantic scope of the phrase. In {{lang|jbo|sutra dansu}} \"to quickly dance\", the modifying word {{lang|jbo|sutra}} narrows the sense of the modified word {{lang|jbo|dansu}} to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives).\n<!--\n* '''English:''' ''Several small fires were burning in the house''.\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|so'i cmalu fagri puca'o jelca ne'i le zdani}}\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]:''' ''many small fire past-continuing burn inside the house'' (Translation after English)\n-->\nOne could go still further, adding a quite extreme example of its syntactic flexibility.\n\nLojban can easily \"imitate\" even one-word sentences from [[polysynthetic language]]s, for example:\n\n* '''[[Nuu-chah-nulth language]]''': ''inkiwihl'minik'isit''\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]''': ''inkiw (fire/burn) -ihl (in-the-house) -'minik (plural) -'is (diminutive) -'it (past-tense)''\n\nwhich can be expressed in Lojban the same way:\n\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|fagykemyzdanerso'icmapru}}\n* '''Gloss:''' ''fire-type-house-inside-many-small-past-event''\n\n===Lexicon===\nCompound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) and borrowed words ({{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}) are continually increasing as the speakers find demands. The number of root words ({{lang|jbo|gismu}}) and structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}) are basically unchanging, but new inventions are to be accepted as experimental components. In fact, it has been noticed that particular inclination or disproportion exists in the available vocabulary. Cortesi<ref>Cortesi, David.

He is also a prominent figure on the mailing list, helping beginners with the language.\n* [[John W. Cowan]]<!-- (aka ''jcowan'')-->: the author of ''The Complete Lojban Language''.\n* Miles Forster (also known as {{lang|jbo|la selpa'i}}): a German Lojbanist who wrote the song ''ca pa djedi''<ref name=\"ca pa djedi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZomVOBE5-0|title=Ca Pa Djedi (Original Song in Lojban by selpa'i)|work=YouTube}}</ref> and made several large translations into Lojban.\n* Robin Turner: a British philosopher and linguist living in Turkey, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.\n* Nick Nicholas (also known as ''la nitcion''): an Australian linguist, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.<!--* Matt Arnold (aka ''la epkat''): has been contributing to the [[translation project]] and software development.-->\n\n== Comparison with other logical languages ==\n\n=== Loglan ===\n{{Main article| Comparison between Lojban and Loglan}}\nThe principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word {{lang|jbo|cnano}} (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] \u5e38, [[pinyin]] ''ch\u00e1ng''), both meaning \"normal\".\n\nLoglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what is said in the [[#Grammar|Grammar]] section above holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by\nword between the two languages.\n\nIn the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only [[intervocally]], and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a \"[[voiceless glide]]\". (This phoneme is realized as [\u03b8] by some speakers.)\n\n=== gua\\spi ===\n{{lang|mis|gua\\spi}} is a descendant of Loglan but is [[tonal language|tonal]], developed by Jim Carter. Instead of structure words there are in {{lang|mis|Gua\\spi}} six different tones. Predicates have only one syllable instead of two. Some of its characteristics, including tones, phonotactics, expressions for masses vs sets, non-existence of metalinguistic negation, etc., received criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/critique_of_gua%5Cspi|title=critique of gua\\spi|work=lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Case grammar]]\n* [[FrameNet]]\n* [[Simplified Technical English]]\n* [[Ithkuil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{InterWiki|code=jbo}}\n{{wikisource|The Complete Lojban Language}}\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q36350|n=no|v=no|voy=no|wikt=Lojban|mw=no|m=no|species=no|commons=Category:Lojban|q=no|s=no}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.lojban.org/}}\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Live_Chat Lojban chats]\n* [https://lojban.github.com/cll/ Reference grammar]\n* [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/en/ a searchable dictionary]\n** [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/ Also available in other languages]\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en Learning materials]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/la_karda la karda: a distilled overview of the Lojban language]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons Wave Lessons, another popular textbook]\n** [http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/lojban/ Lojban courses for English speakers]\n** [http://www.lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_2016-08-26.pdf Complete Lojban language]\n<!--*{{DMOZ|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Constructed/Logical/Lojban/}}-->\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lojban| ]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:1987 introductions]]\n[[Category:Analytic languages]]\n[[Category:Engineered languages]]\n[[Category:Isolating languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Constructed human language based on predicate logic}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name={{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\n|nativename={{lang|jbo|la .lojban.}}\n|pronunciation={{IPA-art|la\u0294\u02c8lo\u0292ban\u0294|}}\n|image=Lojban flag public domain.svg\n|imagesize=200px\n|creator=Logical Language Group\n|created=1987\n|setting=a logically engineered language for various usages\n|fam1=[[Constructed language]]s\n|fam2=[[engineered language]]s\n|fam3=[[engineered language#Logical languages|logical languages]]\n|script=[[Latin script|Latin]] and others\n|posteriori=[[Loglan]]\n|iso2=jbo\n|iso3=jbo\n|notice=IPA\n|glotto=lojb1234\n|glottorefname=Lojban\n}}\n\n'''Lojban''' (pronounced {{IPA-art|\u02c8lo\u0292ban||jbo-lojban.ogg}}) is a [[constructed language|constructed]], [[Syntactic ambiguity|syntactically unambiguous]] human language<!-- based on [[predicate logic]]--> created by the '''Logical Language Group.''' It succeeds the [[Loglan]] project.\n\nThe Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize [[Loglan]]'s purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, \"Lojban: A Realization of Loglan\"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as ''The Complete Lojban Language''. In an interview in 2010 with ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Arika Okrent]], the author of ''In the Land of Invented Languages'', stated: \"The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban\u2014a language created to reflect the principles of logic.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/ |title=Questions Answered: Invented Languages |publisher=The New York Times Schott's Vocab blog}}</ref>\n\nLojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en|title=Welcome!/en - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"{{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] formed from {{lang|jbo|loj}} and {{lang|jbo|ban}}, which are short forms of {{lang|jbo|logji}} (logic) and {{lang|jbo|bangu}} (language).\n\n== History ==\nLojban's predecessor, [[Loglan]], a language invented by [[James Cooke Brown]] in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute, Loglan was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought (an assumption known as the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]]).\n\nAs Brown started to claim his [[copyright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html|title=Why I like Lojban|work=nvg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|title=AI Newsletter|work=ainewsletter.com|access-date=2012-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223111830/http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|archive-date=2011-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> on the language's components, bans were put on the community's activity to stop them changing aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of people decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of Lojban. In effect they established in 1987 The Logical Language Group, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language \"Loglan\".<ref>Johansen, Arnt Richard.

Some of them have, apart from the preferred/standard sounds, permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.\n\nStress normally falls on the penultimate syllable.\n\nThere are 16 [[diphthong]]s (and no [[triphthong]]s). A distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs can be written by inserting a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates {{IPA|[h]}}, though there are other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of adding vowels between them ([[epenthesis]]), as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.\n\nLojban is written almost entirely with lower-case letters; upper-case letters are used to mark stress in words that do not fit the normal rules of stress assignment, or when whitespace is omitted.\n\nThe letters in Lojban and their respective pronunciations are shown in the table below.

Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:\n# Lojban is defined by the [[phoneme]]s rather than graphemes; as long as they are correctly rendered so as to maintain the Lojbanic audio-visual [[isomorphism]], a representational system can be said to be an appropriate orthography of the language;\n# Lojban is meant to be as culturally neutral as possible, so it is never crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.\n\nSome Lojbanists extend this principle to claim that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.<ref>Kena.

Each of them has uniquely identifying properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes. There also exists a special fragmental form assigned to some predicate words and structure words, from which compound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) may be created.<ref>Cowan, John Woldemar.

[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html  ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)</ref>\n\n=== Syntax and semantics ===\nThe language's grammatical structures are \"defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers\", which is in effect called the \"machine grammar\".<ref>Nicholas, Nick. John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']</ref> Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:\n* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;\n* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.\n\nSuch standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:\n\n{{quotation\n|It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.<br /><br />Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. '[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}\n\nThe computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.\n\nIts [[Linguistic typology|typology]] can be said to be basically [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] and [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. However, it can practically be anything:\n* {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} (SVO) (I love you)\n* {{lang|jbo|mi do prami}} (SOV) (By me, you are loved)\n* {{lang|jbo|do se prami mi}} (OVS) (You are loved by me)\n* {{lang|jbo|do mi se prami}} (OSV) (You, I love)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami fa mi do}} (VSO) (Loved by me, you are)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami do fa mi}}, {{lang|jbo|se prami fa do mi}} (VOS) (Love you, I do)\n\nSuch flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} is determined by {{lang|jbo|prami}} realizing, with its own predefined \"place structure\", a specific semantic relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}}; when the positional relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}} changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.\n\nAs befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, another reason why the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.\n\nMultiple predicate words may be linked up together so as to narrow the semantic scope of the phrase. In {{lang|jbo|sutra dansu}} \"to quickly dance\", the modifying word {{lang|jbo|sutra}} narrows the sense of the modified word {{lang|jbo|dansu}} to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives).\n<!--\n* '''English:''' ''Several small fires were burning in the house''.\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|so'i cmalu fagri puca'o jelca ne'i le zdani}}\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]:''' ''many small fire past-continuing burn inside the house'' (Translation after English)\n-->\nOne could go still further, adding a quite extreme example of its syntactic flexibility.\n\nLojban can easily \"imitate\" even one-word sentences from [[polysynthetic language]]s, for example:\n\n* '''[[Nuu-chah-nulth language]]''': ''inkiwihl'minik'isit''\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]''': ''inkiw (fire/burn) -ihl (in-the-house) -'minik (plural) -'is (diminutive) -'it (past-tense)''\n\nwhich can be expressed in Lojban the same way:\n\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|fagykemyzdanerso'icmapru}}\n* '''Gloss:''' ''fire-type-house-inside-many-small-past-event''\n\n===Lexicon===\nCompound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) and borrowed words ({{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}) are continually increasing as the speakers find demands. The number of root words ({{lang|jbo|gismu}}) and structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}) are basically unchanging, but new inventions are to be accepted as experimental components.

He is also a prominent figure on the mailing list, helping beginners with the language.\n* [[John W. Cowan]]<!-- (aka ''jcowan'')-->: the author of ''The Complete Lojban Language''.\n* Miles Forster (also known as {{lang|jbo|la selpa'i}}): a German Lojbanist who wrote the song ''ca pa djedi''<ref name=\"ca pa djedi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZomVOBE5-0|title=Ca Pa Djedi (Original Song in Lojban by selpa'i)|work=YouTube}}</ref> and made several large translations into Lojban.\n* Robin Turner: a British philosopher and linguist living in Turkey, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.\n* Nick Nicholas (also known as ''la nitcion''): an Australian linguist, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.<!--* Matt Arnold (aka ''la epkat''): has been contributing to the [[translation project]] and software development.-->\n\n== Comparison with other logical languages ==\n\n=== Loglan ===\n{{Main article| Comparison between Lojban and Loglan}}\nThe principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word {{lang|jbo|cnano}} (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] \u5e38, [[pinyin]] ''ch\u00e1ng''), both meaning \"normal\".\n\nLoglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what is said in the [[#Grammar|Grammar]] section above holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by\nword between the two languages.\n\nIn the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only [[intervocally]], and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a \"[[voiceless glide]]\". (This phoneme is realized as [\u03b8] by some speakers.)\n\n=== gua\\spi ===\n{{lang|mis|gua\\spi}} is a descendant of Loglan but is [[tonal language|tonal]], developed by Jim Carter. Instead of structure words there are in {{lang|mis|Gua\\spi}} six different tones. Predicates have only one syllable instead of two. Some of its characteristics, including tones, phonotactics, expressions for masses vs sets, non-existence of metalinguistic negation, etc., received criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/critique_of_gua%5Cspi|title=critique of gua\\spi|work=lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Case grammar]]\n* [[FrameNet]]\n* [[Simplified Technical English]]\n* [[Ithkuil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{InterWiki|code=jbo}}\n{{wikisource|The Complete Lojban Language}}\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q36350|n=no|v=no|voy=no|wikt=Lojban|mw=no|m=no|species=no|commons=Category:Lojban|q=no|s=no}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.lojban.org/}}\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Live_Chat Lojban chats]\n* [https://lojban.github.com/cll/ Reference grammar]\n* [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/en/ a searchable dictionary]\n** [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/ Also available in other languages]\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en Learning materials]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/la_karda la karda: a distilled overview of the Lojban language]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons Wave Lessons, another popular textbook]\n** [http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/lojban/ Lojban courses for English speakers]\n** [http://www.lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_2016-08-26.pdf Complete Lojban language]\n<!--*{{DMOZ|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Constructed/Logical/Lojban/}}-->\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lojban| ]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:1987 introductions]]\n[[Category:Analytic languages]]\n[[Category:Engineered languages]]\n[[Category:Isolating languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n", "name_user": "Neutral0814", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExamples of unique Lojbanic expressions:reduced heading; redundant due to \u00a7 title \"Samples\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban"}

It is one of the oldest operating historical cemeteries in the country and Latin America overall. While being officially established on [[November 12]] of [[1879]], people were buried on the premises as early as [[1821]]. The cemetery had many names since foundation, starting nameless and in 1925 being christened \"New Cemetery\", \"New Square\" and \"The Square\" due to its particular form. Since September 2019 it holds the name \"The Square Luxburg-Carolath\".\n\n== History ==\nIn the State of Zulia, as in all of Venezuela, there were different types of cemeteries, including local Indian burials pre-German foundation of the city. With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was a Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches in convents and attached lands they established. The Spanish Crown, in 1698, ordered to bury the deceased next to the parish churches. This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the regular cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church on El Transito street. The cemetery was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881). These cemeteries were looted for the theft of their marbles and other materials or eliminated to perform civil works in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased that were left were transferred to The Square, where Columbaries of 2 and 3 floors were made to accommodate them, they transferred them to The Square simply because it was the closest cemetery to transport the dead. \n \n[[File:Mapa_aereo_casco_central_Maracaibo_1940.png|thumbnail|aerial view in 1940 of the Luxburg-Catolath Square Cemetery]]\nThe foreign resident colony in Maracaibo, founded in 1824 and closed in 1942, what was known as the cemetery of English, Foreigners or Cementerio de Los Alemanes, (The name \u201cEnglish\u201d (ingleses)  name was actually at that time the same as Foreigners a synonym that today is also used as Gringos) the deceased of that cemetery were mostly English and German Protestants, also Jews because they did not have their cemetery and the Protestants got along with the Jews in Maracaibo and other places, there was no religious antipathy at that time between them, was a neighbor of the Colonial cemetery also on El Transit street, on the grounds of the current Panorama Newspaper (one of biggest in Venezuela). The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''

It is one of the oldest operating historical cemeteries in the country and Latin America overall. While being officially established on [[November 12]] of [[1879]], people were buried on the premises as early as [[1821]]. The cemetery had many names since foundation, starting nameless and in 1925 being christened \"New Cemetery\", \"New Square\" and \"The Square\" due to its particular form. Since September 2019 it holds the name \"The Square Luxburg-Carolath\".\n\n== History ==\nIn the State of Zulia, as in all of Venezuela, there were different types of cemeteries, including local Indian burials pre-German foundation of the city. With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was a Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches in convents and attached lands they established. The Spanish Crown, in 1698, ordered to bury the deceased next to the parish churches. This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the regular cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church on El Transito street. The cemetery was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881). These cemeteries were looted for the theft of their marbles and other materials or eliminated to perform civil works in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased that were left were transferred to The Square, where Columbaries of 2 and 3 floors were made to accommodate them, they transferred them to The Square simply because it was the closest cemetery to transport the dead. \n \n[[File:Mapa_aereo_casco_central_Maracaibo_1940.png|thumbnail|aerial view in 1940 of the Luxburg-Catolath Square Cemetery]]\nThe foreign resident colony in Maracaibo, founded in 1824 and closed in 1942, what was known as the cemetery of English, Foreigners or Cementerio de Los Alemanes, (The name \u201cEnglish\u201d (ingleses)  name was actually at that time the same as Foreigners a synonym that today is also used as Gringos) the deceased of that cemetery were mostly English and German Protestants, also Jews because they did not have their cemetery and the Protestants got along with the Jews in Maracaibo and other places, there was no religious antipathy at that time between them, was a neighbor of the Colonial cemetery also on El Transit street, on the grounds of the current Panorama Newspaper (one of biggest in Venezuela). The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''

The purpose of the conference, called by the director of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], was to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of the [[Final Solution|Final solution to the Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}), whereby most of the Jews of [[German-occupied Europe]] would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered. Conference participants included representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and representatives from the SS. In the course of the meeting, Heydrich outlined how European Jews would be rounded up and sent to [[extermination camp]]s in the [[General Government]] (the occupied part of Poland), where they would be killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nDiscrimination against Jews began immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. After the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the extermination of European Jewish people began, and the killings continued and accelerated after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. On 31 July 1941, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] gave written authorization to Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. At the Wannsee Conference, Heydrich emphasised that once the deportation process was complete, the fate of the deportees would become an internal matter under the purview of the SS. A secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was Jewish.\n\nOne copy of the Protocol with circulated minutes of the meeting survived the war. It was found by [[Robert Kempner]] in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the [[German Foreign Office]]. It was used as evidence in the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a [[Holocaust]] memorial.\n\n== Background ==\nLegalized discrimination against Jews in Germany began immediately after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of [[Nazism]] brought together elements of antisemitism, [[racial hygiene]], and [[eugenics]] and combined them with [[pan-Germanism]] and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for the Germanic people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=7}} [[Nazi Germany]] attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=132}}\n\nDiscrimination against Jews, long-standing, but extra-legal, throughout much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived other Jews of the [[Berufsverbot|right to practise their professions]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=38\u201339}} Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67\u201369}} Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|250px|thumb|1935 chart shows racial classifications under the Nuremberg Laws: German, ''[[Mischlinge]]'', and Jew.]]\nIn September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] were enacted, prohibiting marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital sexual relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=346}} The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of German or related blood were defined as citizens; thus, Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=347}}  By the start of World War II in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}}\n\nAfter the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] ordered that the [[Intelligenzaktion|Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} The ''[[Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen]]'' (Special Prosecution Book Poland)\u2014lists of people to be killed\u2014had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} The ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (special task forces) performed these murders with the support of the ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Members of the SS, the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Armed Forces), and the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=429}} Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, [[Romani people]], and the mentally ill.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=430\u2013432}}\n\nOn 31 July 1941, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] gave written authorization to SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Senior Group Leader) [[Reinhard Heydrich]], Chief of the [[RSHA|Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=315}} The resulting ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}} The minutes of the Wannsee Conference estimated the Jewish population of the Soviet Union to be five million, including nearly three million in Ukraine.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=112}}\n\nIn addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the [[Hunger Plan]] devised by [[Herbert Backe]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=476\u2013486, 538\u2013549}}  Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=162\u2013163, 416}} The objective of the Hunger Plan was to inflict deliberate mass starvation on the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] civilian populations under German occupation by directing all food supplies to the German home population and the Wehrmacht on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=669}} According to the historian [[Timothy Snyder]], \"4.2&nbsp;million Soviet citizens (largely Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) were starved\" by the Nazis (and the Nazi-controlled Wehrmacht) in 1941\u20131944 as a result of Backe's plan.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=411}}{{sfn|Gerhard|2009}}\n\nHarvests were poor in Germany in 1940 and 1941 and food supplies were short, as large numbers of forced labourers had been brought into the country to work in the armaments industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=539}} If these workers\u2014as well as the German people\u2014were to be adequately fed, there must be a sharp reduction in the number of \"useless mouths\", of whom the millions of Jews under German rule were, in the light of Nazi ideology, the most obvious example.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=538\u2013549}}\n\nAt the time of the Wannsee Conference, the killing of Jews in the Soviet Union had already been underway for some months. Right from the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]]\u2014the invasion of the Soviet Union\u2014''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to follow the army into the conquered areas and round up and kill Jews. In a letter dated 2 July 1941, Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were to execute [[Comintern]] officials, ranking members of the Communist Party, extremist and radical Communist Party members, [[people's commissar]]s, and Jews in party and government posts.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} Open-ended instructions were given to execute \"other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.)\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} He instructed that any [[pogrom]]s spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} On 8 July, he announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=198}} By August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly\u2014the entire Jewish population.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=207}} By the time planning was underway for the Wannsee Conference, hundreds of thousands of Polish, Serbian, and Russian Jews had already been killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}} The initial plan was to implement ''Generalplan Ost'' after the conquest of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=683}} European Jews would be deported to occupied parts of Russia, where they would be worked to death in road-building projects.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}}\n\n== Planning the conference ==\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - Letter from Reinhard Heydrich to Martin Luther (Invitation).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Letter from Heydrich to [[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]], Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, notifying him that the conference would be delayed.]]\n\nOn 29 November 1941, Heydrich sent invitations for a ministerial conference to be held on 9 December at the offices of [[Interpol]] at ''Am Kleinen Wannsee 16''.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=57}} He changed the venue on 4 December to the eventual location of the meeting.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=57}} He enclosed a copy of a letter from G\u00f6ring dated 31 July that authorised him to plan a so-called [[Final Solution|Final solution to the Jewish question]]. The ministries to be represented were Interior, Justice, the [[Four-year plan]], Propaganda, and the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]].{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=406}}\n\nBetween the date the invitations to the conference went out (29 November) and the date of the cancelled first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December 1941, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December 1941, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attacked the United States]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], causing the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|U.S. to declare war on Japan]] the next day. The [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|Reich government declared war on the U.S.]] on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=407}} Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=2}}{{efn|name=Gerlach}} At the [[Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941]] he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain.{{sfn|Browning|2007|pp=407\u2013408}} On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]''.{{sfn|Dederichs|2009|p=119}} Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which simply stated: \"Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans\".{{sfn|Dederichs|2009|p=119}}\n\nThe war was still ongoing, and since transporting masses of people into a combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would be killed in [[extermination camp]]s set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews from the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nOn 8 January 1942, Heydrich sent new invitations to a meeting to be held on 20 January.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=410}} The venue for the rescheduled conference was a villa at ''[[Ernst Marlier#Wannsee Villa|Am Gro\u00dfen Wannsee 56\u201358]]'', overlooking the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]]. The villa had been purchased from [[Friedrich Minoux]] in 1940 by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Force; SD) for use as a conference centre and guest house.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=65}}\n\n== Attendees ==\nHeydrich invited representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the Justice, Interior, and State Ministries, and representatives from the SS.

Countries were listed in two groups, \"A\" and \"B\". \"A\" countries were those under direct Reich control or occupation (or partially occupied and quiescent, in the case of [[Vichy France]]); \"B\" countries were allied or client states, neutral, or at war with Germany.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=111\u2013112}}{{efn|name=Briefing paper}} The numbers reflect the estimated Jewish population within each country; for example, Estonia is listed as ''[[Judenfrei]]'' (free of Jews), since the 4,500 Jews who remained in Estonia after the German occupation had been exterminated by the end of 1941.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=237, 239}} [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Occupied Poland]] was not on the list because by 1939 [[Second Polish Republic|the country]] was split three ways among [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]] in the west, the [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]] in the east, and the General Government where many [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|Polish and Jewish expellees]] had already been resettled.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=93}}\n\nHeydrich opened the conference with an account of the anti-Jewish measures taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews had emigrated.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=110}} This information was taken from a briefing paper prepared for him the previous week by Eichmann.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=112}}\n\nHeydrich reported that there were approximately eleven million Jews in the whole of Europe, of whom half were in countries not under German control.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=111\u2013112}}{{efn|name=Briefing paper}} He explained that since further Jewish emigration had been prohibited by Himmler, a new solution would take its place: \"evacuating\" Jews to the east. This would be a temporary solution, a step towards the \"final solution of the Jewish question\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n{{quote | Under proper guidance, in the course of the final solution the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes. The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} }}\n\nGerman historian [[Peter Longerich]] notes that vague orders couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime were common, especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=189\u2013190}} The wording of the Wannsee Protocol\u2014the distributed minutes of the meeting\u2014made it clear to participants that evacuation east was a euphemism for death.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - Conference room at the Wannsee Conference House.JPG|thumb|left|The conference room at the Wannsee Conference House, 2006]]\n\nHeydrich went on to say that in the course of the \"practical execution of the final solution\", Europe would be \"combed through from west to east\", but that Germany, Austria, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] would have priority, \"due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} This was a reference to increasing pressure from the [[Gauleiter]]s (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The \"evacuated\" Jews, he said, would first be sent to \"transit ghettos\" in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of \"evacuation\". He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish [[World War I]] veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the [[Iron Cross]], might be sent to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] instead of being killed. \"With this expedient solution\", he said, \"in one fell swoop, many interventions will be prevented.\"{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}}\n\nThe situation of people who were half or quarter Jews, and of Jews who were married to non-Jews, was more complex. Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, their status had been left deliberately ambiguous. Heydrich announced that ''[[Mischling]]e'' (mixed-race persons) of the first degree (persons with two Jewish grandparents) would be treated as Jews. This would not apply if they were married to a non-Jew and had children by that marriage. It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by \"the highest offices of the Party and State\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=115}} Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=115}} A \"''Mischling'' of the second degree\" (a person with one Jewish grandparent) would be treated as German, unless he or she was married to a Jew or a ''Mischling'' of the first degree, had a \"racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew\",{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=115\u2013116}} or had a \"political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=116}} Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non-Jews.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=115\u2013116}} In the case of [[anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]], Heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually, and the impact on any German relatives assessed. If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans, the Jewish partner would not be killed. If they were being raised as Jews, they might be killed or sent to an old-age ghetto.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=116}} These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews, and were not always observed even for them. In most of the occupied countries, Jews were rounded up and killed ''en masse'', and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=414}}{{efn|name=Mischlings}}\n\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - List of Jews in European countries.JPG|thumb|Facsimiles of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference and Eichmann's list, presented under glass at the Wannsee Conference House Memorial]]\n\nHeydrich commented, \"In occupied and unoccupied France, the registration of Jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty\",{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} but in the end, the great majority of French-born Jews survived.{{sfn|Marrus|Paxton|1981|pp=343\u2013344}} More difficulty was anticipated with Germany's allies [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]]. \"In Romania the government has [now] appointed a commissioner for Jewish affairs\", Heydrich said.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} In fact the deportation of Romanian Jews was slow and inefficient despite a high degree of popular antisemitism.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=151\u2013155}} \"In order to settle the question in Hungary\", Heydrich said, \"it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for Jewish questions onto the Hungarian government\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} The Hungarian regime of [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] continued to resist German interference in its Jewish policy until the spring of 1944, when the Wehrmacht invaded Hungary. Very soon, 600,000 Jews of Hungary (and parts of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia occupied by Hungary) were sent to their deaths by Eichmann, with the collaboration of Hungarian authorities.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=159\u2013195}}\n\nHeydrich spoke for nearly an hour. Then followed about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=413}} [[Otto Hofmann]] (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office; [[RuSHA]]) and [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] (State Secretary of the [[Reich Interior Ministry]]) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=113}} [[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]] from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital to the war effort and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=71}}{{efn|name=exemptions}} [[Josef B\u00fchler]], State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=114}} Towards the end of the meeting [[cognac]] was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=113}} \"The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together\", Eichmann said, \"and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all&nbsp;... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination\".{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=413}} Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead, he had found \"an atmosphere not only of agreement on the part of the participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected\".{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=414}}\n\n== Wannsee Protocol ==\n[[File:Lake Wannsee Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Gro\u00dfer Wannsee lake from the villa at 56\u201358 Am Grossen Wannsee, where the conference was held]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|his trial]]: \"How shall I put it \u2013 certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me\".{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=114}} Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=68}} Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for \"minutes\" as the \"Wannsee Protocol\"{{efn|name=Minutes}}) were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} Most of these copies were destroyed at the end of the war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by [[Robert Kempner]], a U.S. prosecutor in the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]], in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=1}}\n\n== Interpretation ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98683, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]\n\nThe Wannsee Conference lasted only about ninety minutes. The enormous importance which has been attached to the conference by post-war writers was not evident to most of its participants at the time. Heydrich did not call the meeting to make fundamental new decisions on the Jewish question. Massive killings of Jews in the conquered territories in the Soviet Union and Poland were ongoing, and a new extermination camp was already under construction at [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] at the time of the conference; other extermination camps were in the planning stages.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}}{{sfn|Breitman|1991|pp=229\u2013233}} The decision to exterminate the Jews had already been made, and Heydrich, as Himmler's emissary, held the meeting to ensure the cooperation of the various departments in conducting the deportations.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=310}} Observations from historian [[Laurence Rees]] support Longerich's position that the decision over the fate of the Jews was determined before the conference; Rees notes that the Wannsee Conference was really a meeting of \"second-level functionaries\", and stresses that neither Himmler, Goebbels, nor Hitler were present.{{sfn|Rees|2017|pp=251\u2013252}} According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the fate of the deportees became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=14}} A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish and who was ''Mischling''.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=14}} \"The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation per se. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated\", said Longerich.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=306, 310}} Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=7}}\n\nEichmann's biographer [[David Cesarani]] agrees with Longerich's interpretation; he notes that Heydrich's main purpose was to impose his own authority on the various ministries and agencies involved in Jewish policy matters, and to avoid any repetition of the disputes that had arisen earlier in the annihilation campaign. \"The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations\", he writes, \"was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east, and [by] cow[ing] other interested parties into toeing the line of the RSHA\".{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n== House of the Wannsee Conference ==\nIn 1965, historian [[Joseph Wulf]] proposed that the Wannsee House should be made into a [[Holocaust]] memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project, and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=134\u2013135}}\n\nOn 20 January 1992, on the fiftieth anniversary of the conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum known as the ''Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz'' (House of the Wannsee Conference).{{sfn|Wannsee House}} The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of the Holocaust and its planning.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=135}} The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek on the second floor houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=135}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Wannsee Conference (film)|''The Wannsee Conference'']] \u2013 a 1984 German TV film\n*[[Conspiracy (2001 film)|''Conspiracy'']] \u2013 a 2001 English language film\n*[[Fatherland (novel)|''Fatherland'']] \u2013 an alternate history novel dealing in large part with the Wannsee Conference\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Gerlach\n| German historian [[Christian Gerlach]] has claimed that Hitler approved the policy of extermination in a speech to senior officials in Berlin on 12 December. {{harvnb|Gerlach|1998|p=785}}.

On 18 December, Himmler met with Hitler and noted in his appointment book: \"Jewish question \u2013 to be exterminated as partisans\". {{harvnb|Browning|2007|p=410}}.

The purpose of the conference, called by the director of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], was to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of the [[Final Solution|Final solution to the Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}), whereby most of the Jews of [[German-occupied Europe]] would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered. Conference participants included representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and representatives from the SS. In the course of the meeting, Heydrich outlined how European Jews would be rounded up and sent to [[extermination camp]]s in the [[General Government]] (the occupied part of Poland), where they would be killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nDiscrimination against Jews began immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. After the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the extermination of European Jewish people began, and the killings continued and accelerated after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. On 31 July 1941, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] gave written authorization to Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. At the Wannsee Conference, Heydrich emphasised that once the deportation process was complete, the fate of the deportees would become an internal matter under the purview of the SS. A secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was Jewish.\n\nOne copy of the Protocol with circulated minutes of the meeting survived the war. It was found by [[Robert Kempner]] in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the [[German Foreign Office]]. It was used as evidence in the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a [[Holocaust]] memorial.\n\n== Background ==\nLegalized discrimination against Jews in Germany began immediately after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of [[Nazism]] brought together elements of antisemitism, [[racial hygiene]], and [[eugenics]] and combined them with [[pan-Germanism]] and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for the Germanic people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=7}} [[Nazi Germany]] attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=132}}\n\nDiscrimination against Jews, long-standing, but extra-legal, throughout much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived other Jews of the [[Berufsverbot|right to practise their professions]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=38\u201339}} Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67\u201369}} Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|250px|thumb|1935 chart shows racial classifications under the Nuremberg Laws: German, ''[[Mischlinge]]'', and Jew.]]\nIn September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] were enacted, prohibiting marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital sexual relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=346}} The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of German or related blood were defined as citizens; thus, Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=347}}  By the start of World War II in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}}\n\nAfter the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] ordered that the [[Intelligenzaktion|Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} The ''[[Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen]]'' (Special Prosecution Book Poland)\u2014lists of people to be killed\u2014had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} The ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (special task forces) performed these murders with the support of the ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Members of the SS, the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Armed Forces), and the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=429}} Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, [[Romani people]], and the mentally ill.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=430\u2013432}}\n\nOn 31 July 1941, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] gave written authorization to SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Senior Group Leader) [[Reinhard Heydrich]], Chief of the [[RSHA|Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=315}} The resulting ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}} The minutes of the Wannsee Conference estimated the Jewish population of the Soviet Union to be five million, including nearly three million in Ukraine.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=112}}\n\nIn addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the [[Hunger Plan]] devised by [[Herbert Backe]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=476\u2013486, 538\u2013549}}  Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=162\u2013163, 416}} The objective of the Hunger Plan was to inflict deliberate mass starvation on the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] civilian populations under German occupation by directing all food supplies to the German home population and the Wehrmacht on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=669}} According to the historian [[Timothy Snyder]], \"4.2&nbsp;million Soviet citizens (largely Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) were starved\" by the Nazis (and the Nazi-controlled Wehrmacht) in 1941\u20131944 as a result of Backe's plan.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=411}}{{sfn|Gerhard|2009}}\n\nHarvests were poor in Germany in 1940 and 1941 and food supplies were short, as large numbers of forced labourers had been brought into the country to work in the armaments industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=539}} If these workers\u2014as well as the German people\u2014were to be adequately fed, there must be a sharp reduction in the number of \"useless mouths\", of whom the millions of Jews under German rule were, in the light of Nazi ideology, the most obvious example.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=538\u2013549}}\n\nAt the time of the Wannsee Conference, the killing of Jews in the Soviet Union had already been underway for some months. Right from the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]]\u2014the invasion of the Soviet Union\u2014''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to follow the army into the conquered areas and round up and kill Jews. In a letter dated 2 July 1941, Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were to execute [[Comintern]] officials, ranking members of the Communist Party, extremist and radical Communist Party members, [[people's commissar]]s, and Jews in party and government posts.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} Open-ended instructions were given to execute \"other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.)\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} He instructed that any [[pogrom]]s spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=523}} On 8 July, he announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=198}} By August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly\u2014the entire Jewish population.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=207}} By the time planning was underway for the Wannsee Conference, hundreds of thousands of Polish, Serbian, and Russian Jews had already been killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}} The initial plan was to implement ''Generalplan Ost'' after the conquest of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=683}} European Jews would be deported to occupied parts of Russia, where they would be worked to death in road-building projects.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}}\n\n== Planning the conference ==\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - Letter from Reinhard Heydrich to Martin Luther (Invitation).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Letter from Heydrich to [[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]], Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, notifying him that the conference would be delayed.]]\n\nOn 29 November 1941, Heydrich sent invitations for a ministerial conference to be held on 9 December at the offices of [[Interpol]] at ''Am Kleinen Wannsee 16''.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=57}} He changed the venue on 4 December to the eventual location of the meeting.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=57}} He enclosed a copy of a letter from G\u00f6ring dated 31 July that authorised him to plan a so-called [[Final Solution|Final solution to the Jewish question]]. The ministries to be represented were Interior, Justice, the [[Four-year plan]], Propaganda, and the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]].{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=406}}\n\nBetween the date the invitations to the conference went out (29 November) and the date of the cancelled first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December 1941, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December 1941, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attacked the United States]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], causing the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|U.S. to declare war on Japan]] the next day. The [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|Reich government declared war on the U.S.]] on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=407}} Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=2}}{{efn|name=Gerlach}} At the [[Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941]] he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain.{{sfn|Browning|2007|pp=407\u2013408}} On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]''.{{sfn|Dederichs|2009|p=119}} Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which simply stated: \"Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans\".{{sfn|Dederichs|2009|p=119}}\n\nThe war was still ongoing, and since transporting masses of people into a combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would be killed in [[extermination camp]]s set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews from the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nOn 8 January 1942, Heydrich sent new invitations to a meeting to be held on 20 January.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=410}} The venue for the rescheduled conference was a villa at ''[[Ernst Marlier#Wannsee Villa|Am Gro\u00dfen Wannsee 56\u201358]]'', overlooking the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]]. The villa had been purchased from [[Friedrich Minoux]] in 1940 by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Force; SD) for use as a conference centre and guest house.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=65}}\n\n== Attendees ==\nHeydrich invited representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the Justice, Interior, and State Ministries, and representatives from the SS.

The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} }}\n\nGerman historian [[Peter Longerich]] notes that vague orders couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime were common, especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=189\u2013190}} The wording of the Wannsee Protocol\u2014the distributed minutes of the meeting\u2014made it clear to participants that evacuation east was a euphemism for death.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - Conference room at the Wannsee Conference House.JPG|thumb|left|The conference room at the Wannsee Conference House, 2006]]\n\nHeydrich went on to say that in the course of the \"practical execution of the final solution\", Europe would be \"combed through from west to east\", but that Germany, Austria, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] would have priority, \"due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} This was a reference to increasing pressure from the [[Gauleiter]]s (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The \"evacuated\" Jews, he said, would first be sent to \"transit ghettos\" in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}} Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of \"evacuation\". He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish [[World War I]] veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the [[Iron Cross]], might be sent to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] instead of being killed. \"With this expedient solution\", he said, \"in one fell swoop, many interventions will be prevented.\"{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=113}}\n\nThe situation of people who were half or quarter Jews, and of Jews who were married to non-Jews, was more complex. Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, their status had been left deliberately ambiguous. Heydrich announced that ''[[Mischling]]e'' (mixed-race persons) of the first degree (persons with two Jewish grandparents) would be treated as Jews. This would not apply if they were married to a non-Jew and had children by that marriage. It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by \"the highest offices of the Party and State\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=115}} Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=115}} A \"''Mischling'' of the second degree\" (a person with one Jewish grandparent) would be treated as German, unless he or she was married to a Jew or a ''Mischling'' of the first degree, had a \"racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew\",{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=115\u2013116}} or had a \"political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=116}} Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non-Jews.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|pp=115\u2013116}} In the case of [[anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]], Heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually, and the impact on any German relatives assessed. If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans, the Jewish partner would not be killed. If they were being raised as Jews, they might be killed or sent to an old-age ghetto.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=116}} These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews, and were not always observed even for them. In most of the occupied countries, Jews were rounded up and killed ''en masse'', and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=414}}{{efn|name=Mischlings}}\n\n[[File:Wannsee Conference - List of Jews in European countries.JPG|thumb|Facsimiles of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference and Eichmann's list, presented under glass at the Wannsee Conference House Memorial]]\n\nHeydrich commented, \"In occupied and unoccupied France, the registration of Jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty\",{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} but in the end, the great majority of French-born Jews survived.{{sfn|Marrus|Paxton|1981|pp=343\u2013344}} More difficulty was anticipated with Germany's allies [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]]. \"In Romania the government has [now] appointed a commissioner for Jewish affairs\", Heydrich said.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} In fact the deportation of Romanian Jews was slow and inefficient despite a high degree of popular antisemitism.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=151\u2013155}} \"In order to settle the question in Hungary\", Heydrich said, \"it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for Jewish questions onto the Hungarian government\".{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=114}} The Hungarian regime of [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] continued to resist German interference in its Jewish policy until the spring of 1944, when the Wehrmacht invaded Hungary. Very soon, 600,000 Jews of Hungary (and parts of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia occupied by Hungary) were sent to their deaths by Eichmann, with the collaboration of Hungarian authorities.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=159\u2013195}}\n\nHeydrich spoke for nearly an hour. Then followed about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation.{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=413}} [[Otto Hofmann]] (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office; [[RuSHA]]) and [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] (State Secretary of the [[Reich Interior Ministry]]) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=113}} [[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]] from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital to the war effort and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=71}}{{efn|name=exemptions}} [[Josef B\u00fchler]], State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=114}} Towards the end of the meeting [[cognac]] was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=113}} \"The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together\", Eichmann said, \"and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all&nbsp;... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination\".{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=413}} Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead, he had found \"an atmosphere not only of agreement on the part of the participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected\".{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=414}}\n\n== Wannsee Protocol ==\n[[File:Lake Wannsee Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Gro\u00dfer Wannsee lake from the villa at 56\u201358 Am Grossen Wannsee, where the conference was held]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|his trial]]: \"How shall I put it \u2013 certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me\".{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=114}} Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=68}} Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for \"minutes\" as the \"Wannsee Protocol\"{{efn|name=Minutes}}) were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} Most of these copies were destroyed at the end of the war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by [[Robert Kempner]], a U.S. prosecutor in the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]], in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.{{sfn|Roseman|2002|p=1}}\n\n== Interpretation ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98683, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]\n\nThe Wannsee Conference lasted only about ninety minutes. The enormous importance which has been attached to the conference by post-war writers was not evident to most of its participants at the time. Heydrich did not call the meeting to make fundamental new decisions on the Jewish question. Massive killings of Jews in the conquered territories in the Soviet Union and Poland were ongoing, and a new extermination camp was already under construction at [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] at the time of the conference; other extermination camps were in the planning stages.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=309}}{{sfn|Breitman|1991|pp=229\u2013233}} The decision to exterminate the Jews had already been made, and Heydrich, as Himmler's emissary, held the meeting to ensure the cooperation of the various departments in conducting the deportations.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=310}} Observations from historian [[Laurence Rees]] support Longerich's position that the decision over the fate of the Jews was determined before the conference; Rees notes that the Wannsee Conference was really a meeting of \"second-level functionaries\", and stresses that neither Himmler, Goebbels, nor Hitler were present.{{sfn|Rees|2017|pp=251\u2013252}} According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the fate of the deportees became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=14}} A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish and who was ''Mischling''.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=14}} \"The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation per se. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated\", said Longerich.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=306, 310}} Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=7}}\n\nEichmann's biographer [[David Cesarani]] agrees with Longerich's interpretation; he notes that Heydrich's main purpose was to impose his own authority on the various ministries and agencies involved in Jewish policy matters, and to avoid any repetition of the disputes that had arisen earlier in the annihilation campaign. \"The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations\", he writes, \"was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east, and [by] cow[ing] other interested parties into toeing the line of the RSHA\".{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n== House of the Wannsee Conference ==\nIn 1965, historian [[Joseph Wulf]] proposed that the Wannsee House should be made into a [[Holocaust]] memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project, and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=134\u2013135}}\n\nOn 20 January 1992, on the fiftieth anniversary of the conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum known as the ''Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz'' (House of the Wannsee Conference).{{sfn|Wannsee House}} The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of the Holocaust and its planning.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=135}} The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek on the second floor houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.{{sfn|Lehrer|2000|p=135}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Wannsee Conference (film)|''The Wannsee Conference'']] \u2013 a 1984 German TV film\n*[[Conspiracy (2001 film)|''Conspiracy'']] \u2013 a 2001 English language film\n*[[Fatherland (novel)|''Fatherland'']] \u2013 an alternate history novel dealing in large part with the Wannsee Conference\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Gerlach\n| German historian [[Christian Gerlach]] has claimed that Hitler approved the policy of extermination in a speech to senior officials in Berlin on 12 December. {{harvnb|Gerlach|1998|p=785}}.

It was designed to be the educational electronic media in the Valley, devoted to alternative programming with a strong commitment to peace and justice.\n\nThe KFCF became a project of the Fresno Free College Foundation in 1972. At that time, Alex Vavoulis was its president. Other Board members were Douglas C. Broten, Les Kimber, Blanche Nosworthy, William T. Richert, James M. Smith and Al Villa. Since 1975, the station has played an important role in the local broadcasting scene.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he does not \"understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body).

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he does not \"understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?'

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term. Computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]]. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time.

He is best known for his two stints in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (later called WWE); the first between 1986 and 1992, and the second between 1995 and 1997. He wrestled in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1983, [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1992, and the [[Lucha libre|Mexico]]-based [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997. He appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] during the summer of 1997 and made appearances for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] from 2006 through 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts was known for his intense and cerebral [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promos]], dark charisma, extensive use of psychology in his matches, and innovative use of the [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] finishing move (which was later named the \"coolest\" maneuver of all time by WWE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-51|title=The 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|work=WWE}}</ref> He often brought snakes into the ring, most famously a [[Python (genus)|python]]. He was one of the subjects of the 1999 documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. In 2012, he moved in with fellow wrestler [[Diamond Dallas Page]] to seek help in getting his life back on track following years of alcohol and drug addiction. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 5, 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nAurelian Jake Smith Jr.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Luis|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-jake-the-snake-roberts-wwf-unspoken-words-20150115-column.html|title=Interview: Get ready for story time with Jake 'The Snake' Roberts|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> was born in [[Gainesville, Texas]], on May 30, 1955. His father, [[Grizzly Smith|Aurelian \"Grizzly\" Smith]] (1932\u20132010), was also a wrestler.

Roberts had trouble developing his character, so in the late 1970s he traveled to Canada to wrestle. While in [[Stampede Wrestling]], Roberts feuded with the [[Junkyard Dog]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6CbXzEgzZ0|title=Jim Ross Interviews \" Jake the Snake \u2013 Roberts \"|date=February 20, 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxy6GJTTBQ|title=Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter \u2013 Ladder Match: Stampede, July, 1979|date=December 10, 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Georgia Championship Wrestling during 1983 that Roberts became part of [[Paul Ellering]]'s [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], the [[The Road Warriors#History|Legion of Doom]], and began a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ron Garvin]] over the [[NWA National Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] that lasted into 1984. In 1984, Roberts entered [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) joining up with [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|\"Gentleman\" Chris Adams]] and [[Gino Hernandez]] in their feud against the [[Von Erich family|Von Erichs]], winning the WCCW Television title and 6-Man Tag Team title (with Adams and Hernandez). Roberts returned to Mid-South Wrestling for 1985, ending his run there in February 1986 after a feud with [[Dick Slater]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====Debut and championship pursuits (1986\u20131990)====\n[[File:Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Many of Roberts' storylines revolved around the use of his snake, Damien, seen here in the middle of the ring]]\nRoberts debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in March 1986. A month later, he made his [[pay-per-view]] debut, defeating [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] at [[WrestleMania 2]]. During the match, Roberts made Wells foam from the mouth when he wrapped his snake Damien around Wells's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|publisher=Slam Wrestling|author=Powell, John|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts' first major feud was against [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], beginning on a nationally televised episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VI]]'' in May 1986. Roberts executed the DDT on Steamboat on the exposed concrete floor right in front of his wife Bonnie and then proceeded to rest his snake Damien on top of a prone Steamboat. While [[Vince McMahon]] and booker [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]] were adamant about wanting the DDT to take place on the floor, Roberts initially refused until Steamboat told him that he would be able to adequately protect himself from injury. Unfortunately, Steamboat was unable to stop his head from hitting the concrete and was rendered unconscious, sustaining a concussion.<ref name=WWF6389Book>{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 \u2013 1989|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1492825975}}</ref> After Steamboat's recovery, Steamboat introduced a \"[[Komodo dragon]]\" as his pet to combat the psychological effects of Roberts' snake. The feud continued with Steamboat winning most of the matches (losing only one because he threw Roberts back in the ring before the 10 count, while not beating the count himself), most notably a Snake Pit Match (ostensibly a no-DQ match) at ''[[The Big Event]]'' in [[Toronto]], and the rematch on the October 1986 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]''.\n\nRecognizing his microphone skills, Roberts was given his own talk segment called \"The Snake Pit\", which debuted on the first episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in late 1986. \"The Snake Pit\" was patterned after \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (to replace \"Piper's Pit\" after [[Roddy Piper]]'s retirement following [[WrestleMania III]])<ref name=WWF6389Book/> until the final segment aired in July 1987.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia281\">{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/281 281]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|title-link=WWE Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1986, Roberts began to enjoy an upsurge in fan popularity, despite the WWF's attempts to cast him as an unpopular villain. In November 1986, Roberts challenged Randy Savage for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. Before the match, announcer Vince McMahon said the fans would probably support Savage against the disliked Roberts. However, to the surprise of both McMahon and fellow broadcaster [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]], the fans cheered loudly for Roberts throughout the bout. The match ended in a double disqualification. Around the same time, the WWF had also tried to set Roberts up as a nemesis to then fan-favorite [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]]. However, after Roberts hit Hogan with a DDT during an episode of ''The Snake Pit'', fans responded positively to the attack by chanting \"DDT\" rather than for Hogan, and McMahon abandoned his plans for a feud between them. Years later in a 2015 shoot interview, Roberts jokingly thanked the fans for ruining what would have been the biggest (and most profitable) run of his career as at the time Hogan was the biggest and most popular babyface and a run against Hogan would have meant main event television and PPV matches.\n\nHe officially turned face when he feuded with [[The Honky Tonk Man]], an [[Elvis impersonator]], who attacked Roberts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/wrestlinggonewrong.com|title=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> with a guitar during his interview segment ''The Snake Pit''.

The attack led to their match at WrestleMania III in which Roberts had [[Detroit]] native [[Alice Cooper]] (a known lover of snakes) in his corner. After Honky Tonk won the Intercontinental Championship from Ricky Steamboat, Roberts unsuccessfully challenged him for the Championship several times throughout the rest of 1987. The initial plan was for Roberts to win the Intercontinental Championship shortly after The Honky Tonk Man's win over Steamboat and begin an angle with [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], but because of the injuries from the guitar shot, the decision was made to keep the belt with The Honky Tonk Man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-10-things-need-know-jake-snake-roberts.php/7|title=WWE: 10 Things You Need To Know About Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=April 3, 2016|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe then had a feud with [[Rick Rude|Ravishing Rick Rude]] and his manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], who began a gimmick of selecting a woman from the crowd to kiss after each match.

On the March 11, 1989, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XX]]'', Andr\u00e9 got involved in a match between Rick Rude and [[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake]], siding with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member Rude.

Instead of fighting for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], the prize of the feud was DiBiase's own [[Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Belt]]. It was at this time that Roberts' problems with the discs in his back were publicly acknowledged, as DiBiase attacked Roberts after a victory over his bodyguard [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]''. In the attack, Roberts was (storyline) injured by DiBiase and needed time off to have surgery to repair the damage. Roberts returned and feuded with DiBiase throughout the end of 1989 into 1990, including a point where Roberts stole DiBiase's Million Dollar Belt, daring him or Virgil to reach into the canvas sack where Damien was to retrieve it. The culmination of their feud took place at [[WrestleMania VI]] at the [[Skydome]] in Toronto, where in a match where the Million Dollar Belt was on the line, DiBiase gained a count-out victory over Roberts, thus regaining his non-sanctioned title. After the match, Roberts mounted an offensive against DiBiase and Virgil and then began giving away DiBiase's \"money\" including giving some money to actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] who was seated at ringside.\n\nFollowing a brief feud with [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] in the summer of 1990, Roberts feuded with [[Rick Martel|Rick \"The Model\" Martel]] throughout late 1990 into early 1991, after Martel ([[kayfabe]]) blinded Roberts by spraying his cologne \"Arrogance\" into his eyes. Roberts went so far as to wear white contact lenses to \"prove\" his blindness. After several months, the feud culminated in a match at [[WrestleMania VII]], in which both contestants were blindfolded (though both Roberts and Martel did later confess to having some limited vision due to the lights in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The bout ended after Roberts was able to \"locate\" Martel and deliver a DDT.\n\n====Various feuds and departure (1991\u20131992)====\nIn early to mid-1991, Roberts engaged in a feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] who \"squashed\" Damien with a pair of [[professional wrestling attacks#Senton|Earthquake splashes]] during their match on the April 27 (taped March 26) edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Graham\n|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1991|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> In reality, Roberts' bag contained hamburger meat intended to look like a snake and a small mechanical device to depict movement.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/henry6.htm|first=Justin|last=Henry|date=January 2, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2016|title=The Dominance of a Natural Disaster}}</ref> The feud was advanced when, several weeks later, Earthquake appeared on ''WWF Prime Time Wrestling'' and served \"Quakeburgers\" to co-host [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]] and [[Vince McMahon]], later claiming that the meat was ground from Damien's carcass.<ref name=\"Wrestlecrap\">{{cite book | authors=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap \u2013 the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press | year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre }}</ref> Roberts later introduced a new snake, Damien's \"big brother\" Lucifer.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Michael|last=Moore|title=Collectible News: Action Figure Spotlight - 40-inch \"Damien\" snake|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_64264.shtml#.V4Anl7grLIV|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1991 there were a series of televised vignettes featuring the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]] turning to Roberts for help in his feud with [[The Undertaker]]. In the set-up, Roberts explained to Warrior that, after passing three tests, he would have the \"knowledge of the dark side\" to defeat Undertaker. The segments included Warrior being locked inside a coffin (a reprise of an incident that occurred on ''The Funeral Parlor'', hosted by the Undertaker's manager, [[Paul Bearer]]; earlier in the year); the Warrior being \"buried alive\" in dirt before being abandoned; and Warrior walking through a room full of live snakes to reach a chest containing \"the answer\". During the latter segment, the Warrior opened the chest, only to be immediately bitten by a [[king cobra]] (actually a rubber prop). As Warrior \"weakened\" from the effects of the cobra's strike, Roberts was joined by The Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70 70\u201371]|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6|url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70}}</ref> Roberts closed the final segment by proclaiming, ''\"Never trust a snake\"'', turning Roberts [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time since 1987.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|pages=47\u201348|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}</ref> A series of matches were planned, but the feud was canceled after the Ultimate Warrior was fired by the WWF the night of [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter SummerSlam, Roberts was placed in a feud with [[Randy Savage]]. During the post-SummerSlam wedding reception of Savage and [[Miss Elizabeth]] (in reality they had been married since 1984), Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live cobra.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Sporting News|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/wwe/list/wwe-summerslam-best-moments-randy-savage-shawn-michaels-bret-hart-john-cena-brock-lesnar/8sknr46ybywb1vfpr0c19tmw3/slide/1|accessdate=July 5, 2010|title=Macho Man marries Elizabeth -- 1991|first=Brian|last=Fritz|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Roberts and the Undertaker attacked Savage, until [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] ran them off. A short feud with Sid ensued when Sid was scheduled to wrestle \"El Diablo\" and the Undertaker came out and accepted the challenge to face Sid. Paul Bearer offered \"El Diablo\" what appeared to be a bribe to walk away. As the match began, \"El Diablo\" came back to the ring and hit Sid. Then \"El Diablo\" unmasked revealing himself as Jake. Roberts proceeded to unleash a king cobra on Sid, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan intervened. Sid and Jake wrestled on ''Superstars'' a week later. But soon, Sid injured his biceps, which forced the feud to end.<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nRoberts immediately began berating Randy Savage in a series of promos, aware that Savage \u2013 who had lost a retirement match to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII \u2013 was unable to exact revenge. During an October 21 taping for ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Roberts goaded Savage into the ring and brutally attacked him, eventually tying Savage into the ropes and got the king cobra to bite his arm; the snake was devenomized and, according to Roberts' DVD ''Pick Your Poison'', he had trouble getting the cobra to release his bite. According to Roberts, on the day the angle was shot, he had to let the cobra bite him on his leg at Savage's request to convince him that the snake had been devenomized and Savage would regularly check on Roberts to make sure he had no side effects from the bite. The segment went on longer than planned, and Savage's blood was clearly visible as it dripped from the puncture wounds.\n\nWWF president [[Jack Tunney]] reinstated Savage as an active wrestler to get revenge for the attack. To explain the absence of the cobra, Tunney \"banned\" Roberts from ever bringing a snake to the ring again. Savage and Roberts feuded for the next few months. Their first match was at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] [[pay-per-view]] on December 3 in San Antonio, Texas, which saw Savage earn a victory over Roberts and Roberts slap Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued through the early part of 1992 and included Savage eliminating Roberts from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match. The feud ended on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', with Savage getting the win. Roberts, livid at having lost to him and having received two of Savage's flying elbow drops (one of which after the match), was helped backstage. Enraged, he grabbed a steel chair and said that he was going to hit whoever came backstage first, whether it was Savage or Elizabeth. Just as Roberts was about to swing the chair, he was stopped by the Undertaker; Roberts was distracted long enough for Savage to hit him with the chair instead. That incident helped set up Roberts' feud with the Undertaker. Roberts appeared on ''The Funeral Parlor'' to demand answers from the Undertaker about why he stopped him from attacking Elizabeth. When Roberts was dissatisfied with the answers, he hit Bearer with a DDT and, after jamming Undertaker's hand in a coffin, began hitting him with a steel chair; however, Undertaker got up after each chair shot and eventually chased Roberts backstage dragging the coffin behind him. At [[WrestleMania VIII]], Roberts lost the match, [[Undefeated WrestleMania streak of The Undertaker|becoming the second man to lose to The Undertaker at WrestleMania]].<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nThe WrestleMania VIII match turned out to be Roberts' last for the WWF for nearly four years. His departure came after he was upset that WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]] did not offer him a position on the writing staff, despite being promised such previously. After [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] stepped down from his post on the writing staff stemming from the recent sexual harassment scandal, McMahon decided that, out of respect for Patterson, the spot would be left vacant. Roberts felt he was not only being lied to, but also being betrayed. In response, he threatened to [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-show]] WrestleMania if he was not given a release from his contract. On his 'Pick Your Poison' DVD, Roberts expressed his regret for his actions to get a release from his contract.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1992)===\nRoberts went on to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) alongside his father, [[Grizzly Smith]], where he aligned himself with [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] to feud against [[Steve Borden|Sting]] and [[Nikita Koloff]]. However, before he could officially join WCW, he had to wait 90 days. According to the ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD, Roberts had initially signed a lucrative contract under Kip Allen Frey, who was running WCW at the time. On the 87th day, Frey stepped down and was replaced by [[Bill Watts]], for whom Roberts had [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] with back in his days at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. Ultimately, Roberts estimates that he went from making about $3.5&nbsp;million a year to approximately $200,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/03/01/the-smark-dvd-rant-for-jake-roberts-pick-your-poison/|title=The SmarK DVD Rant for Jake Roberts: Pick Your Poison {{!}} Inside Pulse|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made his first television appearance on August 2, 1992 at a ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' taping in Baltimore, Maryland after coming through the crowd to attack [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw92.htm|website=History of WCW|title=History of WCW|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> His first WCW match came six days later when he defeated [[Marcus Alexander Bagwell]] on a house show in Chicago, Illinois. He would quickly form an alliance with Cactus Jack and The Barbarian. His first major TV wrestling appearance for WCW was at ''[[Clash of the Champions XX]]'', where his team won a 4-man elimination tag match. Roberts scored a pinfall victory over Sting, which built their feud further. His single WCW [[pay-per-view]] match was against Sting at [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]] in 1992. Their match was determined via the [[Professional wrestling match types#Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal|Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]].<ref name=mf229>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.229)</ref> There was a series of gimmick matches on the wheel, but because the wheel itself was not gimmicked, neither Roberts nor Sting knew the kind of match they would be wrestling until the wheel stopped spinning. When the wheel stopped, it had landed on what many observers believed was the worst option \u2014 the [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Coal Miner's Glove match]]. While Halloween Havoc was the company's top-selling PPV for several years,<ref name=mf229/> Roberts soon left WCW.\n\nFollowing the loss to Sting he continued his feud, facing him on several house shows immediately after the event. On the November 2 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'', [[Tony Schiavone]] conducted a sit-down interview with Roberts regarding the decision of Bill Watts to ban his bringing of the snake to ringside, and his impending first round match against [[Dustin Rhodes]] in the first round of the King of Cable tournament. He was replaced in the tournament by [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].\n\n=== Various promotions (1993\u20131994)===\nAfter leaving WCW, Roberts spent his next couple of years wrestling around the world. In February 1993, he took part in a tour in Australia. He won the [[American Wrestling Federation]] Heavyweight Title defeating [[Don Muraco]] on March 4. Then in April 1993, he toured Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. In September 1993, he took part wrestling a tour for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nRoberts debuted in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] promotion [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) in April 1993, causing the defeat of [[Konnan]] in the career vs. career match at [[Tripleman\u00eda I]]. Roberts' run-in started a feud that lasted until 1994 at [[Tripleman\u00eda II-C]], in which Konnan defeated Roberts in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. hair match]].\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Roberts returned to the United States to wrestle for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). On May 2, he defeated [[Tony Anthony]] to win the [[SMW Heavyweight Championship]]; the title change aired on May 14. Roberts no-showed several defenses, forcing SMW to give the title back to Anthony on July 5. By the end of 1994, Roberts took a hiatus.\n\n===Return to WWF (1996\u20131997)===\n{{details|The Attitude Era}}\nAfter spending over a year in hiatus, Roberts returned to WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in 1996, as a [[Bible]]-preacher.<ref name=mf229/> To go along with his new gimmick, his new Albino Burmese Python was named \"[[Book of Revelation|Revelations]].\" His gimmick also mirrored his real life, as Roberts had recently become a [[born-again Christian]] and had been preaching around the country.<ref name=mf229/>\n\n[[Image:Jake Roberts in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roberts and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] in 1996]]\nDuring his second tenure with the company, Roberts was pushed as a \"[[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] story\" and faced [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in the final match of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996]] [[King of the Ring tournament]]. Changes had to be made to the match's scripting as legitimate injuries sustained earlier in the evening in a match with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] left Roberts unable to engage in the longer, more evenly matched bout originally intended between the men. In order to prevent Roberts from sustaining further injury, he was quickly defeated by Austin; in a post-match interview, Austin mocked his recital of the biblical passage [[John 3:16]] by saying ''\"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your [[Psalms]], talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\"''.<ref name=mf229/> The [[catchphrase]] helped propel Austin to the top of the WWF, and is one of the moments that is often cited as the beginning of \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". Roberts next feuded with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]], who went to great lengths to ridicule Roberts' past [[alcoholism]].\n\nIn early 1997, the WWF wanted Roberts to wind down his in-ring career and to join the backstage side of the company. Since he still loved to wrestle, he did not make this transition well. This led to a relapse with drugs and alcohol. He appeared at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] where he entered at no. 7 and was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. His last match with WWF was at ''Shotgun Saturday Night'' on January 25, 1997 against [[Salvatore Sincere]] in a winning effort. He was released in February 1997.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997\u20131998)===\nDuring the summer of 1997, Roberts debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. His introduction came towards the end of a match between Lawler and [[Tommy Dreamer]], which was the main event of the show. As the match went on, the arena lights were turned off. Moments later when the lights came back on, Roberts was already in the ring, and proceeded to give Tommy Dreamer a clothesline. He then went to the camera man and screamed; \"''Your God... he giveth, and he can taketh away. My God, he giveth... but he ain't got the balls to do nothin' else''.\" He promptly clotheslined Lawler, who fell onto Dreamer for a two count before exiting the ring.\n\nRoberts also teamed with [[Tommy Dreamer]] at the 1998 [[November to Remember]] as his mystery partner against [[Justin Credible]] and [[Jack Victory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme Championship Wrestling Results (1998)|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw/1998.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u2013present)===\nIn October 1999, Roberts was one of several former NWA, WWF, and ECW wrestlers brought in to compete in the first ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' event in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. He was booked to face [[Jim Neidhart]] in one half of the card's double main event in what was billed as a \"special grudge match\" between the two. Roberts was so intoxicated that during the course of the night, he slurred his way through a promo before the match and staggered to, from, and around the ring during his entrance. After doing such things as pretending his snake was a penis and stroking it like he was masturbating and attempting to kiss the snake with his tongue, the show's promoter sent [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], who were supposed to compete in the other main event match, to the ring and made the main event a tag team match with Roberts teaming with Yokozuna against Bundy and Neidhart. Roberts, who was so drunk that he could not stand up, took the fall in the match after Bundy splashed and pinned him.\n\nIn 2001, Roberts moved to [[Great Britain]], where he began competing for Brian Dixon's [[All Star Wrestling]]. In December, he made his debut for [[Ricky Knight]]'s [[World Association of Wrestling]] in [[Lowestoft]]. On October 20, 2002, Roberts became the NWA UK Hammerlock Heavyweight Champion in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], [[England]] by defeating \"Vigilante\" Johnny Moss. Moss regained the title the next night in [[Ashford, Kent]], though. In November 2002, Roberts started his own wrestling promotion in the UK, called \"Real Stars of Wrestling\". RSOW ran three events, each headlined by Roberts vs. The Honky Tonk Man.\n\nRoberts made his final British appearance at WAW's ''October Outrage'' show in Canvey Island, Essex, once again teaming with Steve Quintain against the [[UK Pitbulls]]. However, Roberts turned up at the show \"in no fit state to compete\", but went ahead with his match. Roberts cut a drunken promo paying tribute to [[Ray Traylor]], who had died a few days before, and almost got into a scuffle with several WAW wrestlers who were sent out to defuse the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = smackdown-raw-superstars-nxt \u2013 Jake Roberts|url = http://mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com/post/189|website = mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com|access-date = February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made an appearance at [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]'s Houston-based [[Reality of Wrestling|Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (PWA) promotion, in which he cut a promo urging those who want to enter the wrestling business to not follow along his path. At one point, he said he loved the wrestling business more than anything else in the world. PWA wrestler \"Rockstar\" Robbie Gillmore then interrupted Roberts and attempted to make an alliance based upon the fact that Robbie wears an 80s style shirt featuring a cobra. Roberts had just said all he ever wanted was a little respect, and the Rockstar's interruption irritated him. Roberts then attacked Gillmore.\n\nOn October 6, 2007 he lost to [[Scott Hall]] at [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn May 2009, Roberts joined the [[Jim Rose Circus]] for the ''Jim Rose Circus vs. Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts: The Legends Collide Tour''. Advertised as \"a grueling 40 city campaign\" containing pretty girls, wrestling, amazing circus stunts, and a fist fight, the tour features [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose]] and wrestler [[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn Bodhi]] as \"Team Jake\".\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Roberts wrestled what was billed as his retirement match, when he defeated Sinn Bodhi at the [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG) show during the [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 5|WrestleReunion 5]] weekend.<ref name=WrestleReunion5>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_47214.shtml|title=1/29 PWG results in Los Angeles: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of PWG Title match, Kaval vs. Davey, Roberts retirement, Legends Battle Royal|last=Massingham|first=Matt|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2013, Roberts returned to the ring for First State Championship Wrestling, a Delaware-based wrestling promotion, as part of an eight-man tag team main event. He teamed with Eric Chapel and CraziiWolf (Crazii Shea and Greywolf), defeating the team of [[Salvatore Sincere]], Steve C Wrestling and Pretty Ugly ([[James Ellsworth (wrestler)|Jimmy Dream]] and Adam Ugly).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/1cwwrestling/posts/1601622733396798|title=1CW results from 5/18/14|work=facebook.com}}</ref> On March 15, 2014, Roberts debuted in Regional Championship Wrestling's Rumblemania 9 in Reading, Pennsylvania as a surprise partner for Cliff Serenyi against Russian Mafia with Rich Rogers. This match ended in a DQ. Rogers was knocked out when Roberts stuck the snake in Roger's pants.\n\nOn June 14, 2014, Roberts participated in a six-man tag match in the main event for Reborn Wrestling (a Christian wrestling organization in Johnson City, Tennessee), teaming with The Stallion and Alex Cage to defeat [[EZ Money]], Reborn Champion Cody Ices and Anthony Brody.<ref>{{cite web|title=6/14 Reborn Wrestling: Jake Roberts and EZ Money meet in the six-man tag main event of a Christian based pro wrestling show|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?6-14-Reborn-Wrestling-Jake-Roberts-and-EZ-Money-meet-in-the-six-man-tag-main-event-of-a-Christian-based-pro-wrestling-show-37554|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> On June 15, 2014, Roberts was an entrant in the [[CWF Hollywood]] Red Carpet Rumble which was won by [[Willie Mack (wrestler)|Willie Mack]].\n[[File:Jake at CB Seminar.jpg|thumb|upright|Roberts talking at a wrestling seminar in 2016]]\nIn 2016, he went on his Unspoken Word tour.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006, 2008)===\nRoberts made an appearance on the October 19, 2006 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''.

Other snakes used were a [[python reticulatus|Reticulated Python]] named Lucifer, an unnamed (de-venomized) [[Cobra]], and an albino Burmese Python named Revelations (during Roberts' Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the pin, Roberts would coil the constrictor around the opponent's neck, and the snake would slither around on top of the fallen wrestler, sometimes appearing to strangle him.\n\nRoberts has been praised by his fellow wrestlers for his psychology in the ring.<ref name=resurrection/> [[Jim Ross]] has stated that Roberts stands out for not only his ring psychology, but also his promo work.<ref name=resurrection>{{cite video|title=The Resurrection of Jake the Snake|year=2015|people=Yu, Steve (director)|medium=Documentary|publisher=Slamdance}}</ref> [[Ted DiBiase]] has stated how much he enjoyed working with Roberts,<ref name=resurrection/> while [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] rated Roberts as the second best worker he worked with.

Amongst the more disturbing moments was Roberts reportedly smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]] in a hotel room after a reunion with his daughter Brandy, though the act is not shown on camera. In 2005, Roberts, along with others, heavily criticized the film for showing him in a negative light, complaining that the depiction of him was \"not the real Jake Roberts.\" Roberts also stated that director Barry Blaustein and [[Terry Funk]] lied to him about the aims of the film, telling him it was a [[television special]] on the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nRoberts was featured in another wrestling documentary in 2015 entitled ''The Resurrection of Jake the Snake'', which chronicled his time living with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] beginning in October 2012.<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nRoberts appeared as Mr. Lucas, the owner of a gourmet condom company, in the comedy film, ''[[The Bet (2016 film)|The Bet]]'' which also featured Dallas Page and [[Roddy Piper]].\n\nRoberts also made an appearance in ''An Almost True Story: TOXIC TUTU'' in 2015, as himself, in a scene with [[Jonny Fairplay]] from ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.\n\nRoberts has a role in the 2019 film ''[[The Peanut Butter Falcon]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Health issues===\nIn 2007, WWE started a policy of paying all expenses for its former performers who wanted to start [[drug rehabilitation]] programs.

American actor and [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW). He is best known for his two stints in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (later called WWE); the first between 1986 and 1992, and the second between 1995 and 1997. He wrestled in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1983, [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1992, and the [[Lucha libre|Mexico]]-based [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997. He appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] during the summer of 1997 and made appearances for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] from 2006 through 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts was known for his intense and cerebral [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promos]], dark charisma, extensive use of psychology in his matches, and innovative use of the [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] finishing move (which was later named the \"coolest\" maneuver of all time by WWE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-51|title=The 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|work=WWE}}</ref> He often brought snakes into the ring, most famously a [[Python (genus)|python]]. He was one of the subjects of the 1999 documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. In 2012, he moved in with fellow wrestler [[Diamond Dallas Page]] to seek help in getting his life back on track following years of alcohol and drug addiction. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 5, 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nAurelian Jake Smith Jr.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Luis|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-jake-the-snake-roberts-wwf-unspoken-words-20150115-column.html|title=Interview: Get ready for story time with Jake 'The Snake' Roberts|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> was born in [[Gainesville, Texas]], on May 30, 1955.

Roberts had trouble developing his character, so in the late 1970s he traveled to Canada to wrestle. While in [[Stampede Wrestling]], Roberts feuded with the [[Junkyard Dog]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6CbXzEgzZ0|title=Jim Ross Interviews \" Jake the Snake \u2013 Roberts \"|date=February 20, 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxy6GJTTBQ|title=Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter \u2013 Ladder Match: Stampede, July, 1979|date=December 10, 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Georgia Championship Wrestling during 1983 that Roberts became part of [[Paul Ellering]]'s [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], the [[The Road Warriors#History|Legion of Doom]], and began a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ron Garvin]] over the [[NWA National Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] that lasted into 1984. In 1984, Roberts entered [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) joining up with [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|\"Gentleman\" Chris Adams]] and [[Gino Hernandez]] in their feud against the [[Von Erich family|Von Erichs]], winning the WCCW Television title and 6-Man Tag Team title (with Adams and Hernandez). Roberts returned to Mid-South Wrestling for 1985, ending his run there in February 1986 after a feud with [[Dick Slater]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====Debut and championship pursuits (1986\u20131990)====\n[[File:Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Many of Roberts' storylines revolved around the use of his snake, Damien, seen here in the middle of the ring]]\nRoberts debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in March 1986. A month later, he made his [[pay-per-view]] debut, defeating [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] at [[WrestleMania 2]]. During the match, Roberts made Wells foam from the mouth when he wrapped his snake Damien around Wells's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|publisher=Slam Wrestling|author=Powell, John|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts' first major feud was against [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], beginning on a nationally televised episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VI]]'' in May 1986. Roberts executed the DDT on Steamboat on the exposed concrete floor right in front of his wife Bonnie and then proceeded to rest his snake Damien on top of a prone Steamboat. While [[Vince McMahon]] and booker [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]] were adamant about wanting the DDT to take place on the floor, Roberts initially refused until Steamboat told him that he would be able to adequately protect himself from injury. Unfortunately, Steamboat was unable to stop his head from hitting the concrete and was rendered unconscious, sustaining a concussion.<ref name=WWF6389Book>{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 \u2013 1989|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1492825975}}</ref> After Steamboat's recovery, Steamboat introduced a \"[[Komodo dragon]]\" as his pet to combat the psychological effects of Roberts' snake. The feud continued with Steamboat winning most of the matches (losing only one because he threw Roberts back in the ring before the 10 count, while not beating the count himself), most notably a Snake Pit Match (ostensibly a no-DQ match) at ''[[The Big Event]]'' in [[Toronto]], and the rematch on the October 1986 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]''.\n\nRecognizing his microphone skills, Roberts was given his own talk segment called \"The Snake Pit\", which debuted on the first episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in late 1986. \"The Snake Pit\" was patterned after \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (to replace \"Piper's Pit\" after [[Roddy Piper]]'s retirement following [[WrestleMania III]])<ref name=WWF6389Book/> until the final segment aired in July 1987.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia281\">{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/281 281]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|title-link=WWE Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1986, Roberts began to enjoy an upsurge in fan popularity, despite the WWF's attempts to cast him as an unpopular villain. In November 1986, Roberts challenged Randy Savage for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. Before the match, announcer Vince McMahon said the fans would probably support Savage against the disliked Roberts. However, to the surprise of both McMahon and fellow broadcaster [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]], the fans cheered loudly for Roberts throughout the bout. The match ended in a double disqualification. Around the same time, the WWF had also tried to set Roberts up as a nemesis to then fan-favorite [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]]. However, after Roberts hit Hogan with a DDT during an episode of ''The Snake Pit'', fans responded positively to the attack by chanting \"DDT\" rather than for Hogan, and McMahon abandoned his plans for a feud between them. Years later in a 2015 shoot interview, Roberts jokingly thanked the fans for ruining what would have been the biggest (and most profitable) run of his career as at the time Hogan was the biggest and most popular babyface and a run against Hogan would have meant main event television and PPV matches.\n\nHe officially turned face when he feuded with [[The Honky Tonk Man]], an [[Elvis impersonator]], who attacked Roberts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/wrestlinggonewrong.com|title=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> with a guitar during his interview segment ''The Snake Pit''.

The attack led to their match at WrestleMania III in which Roberts had [[Detroit]] native [[Alice Cooper]] (a known lover of snakes) in his corner. After Honky Tonk won the Intercontinental Championship from Ricky Steamboat, Roberts unsuccessfully challenged him for the Championship several times throughout the rest of 1987. The initial plan was for Roberts to win the Intercontinental Championship shortly after The Honky Tonk Man's win over Steamboat and begin an angle with [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], but because of the injuries from the guitar shot, the decision was made to keep the belt with The Honky Tonk Man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-10-things-need-know-jake-snake-roberts.php/7|title=WWE: 10 Things You Need To Know About Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=April 3, 2016|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe then had a feud with [[Rick Rude|Ravishing Rick Rude]] and his manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], who began a gimmick of selecting a woman from the crowd to kiss after each match.

Instead of fighting for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], the prize of the feud was DiBiase's own [[Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Belt]]. It was at this time that Roberts' problems with the discs in his back were publicly acknowledged, as DiBiase attacked Roberts after a victory over his bodyguard [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]''. In the attack, Roberts was (storyline) injured by DiBiase and needed time off to have surgery to repair the damage. Roberts returned and feuded with DiBiase throughout the end of 1989 into 1990, including a point where Roberts stole DiBiase's Million Dollar Belt, daring him or Virgil to reach into the canvas sack where Damien was to retrieve it. The culmination of their feud took place at [[WrestleMania VI]] at the [[Skydome]] in Toronto, where in a match where the Million Dollar Belt was on the line, DiBiase gained a count-out victory over Roberts, thus regaining his non-sanctioned title. After the match, Roberts mounted an offensive against DiBiase and Virgil and then began giving away DiBiase's \"money\" including giving some money to actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] who was seated at ringside.\n\nFollowing a brief feud with [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] in the summer of 1990, Roberts feuded with [[Rick Martel|Rick \"The Model\" Martel]] throughout late 1990 into early 1991, after Martel ([[kayfabe]]) blinded Roberts by spraying his cologne \"Arrogance\" into his eyes. Roberts went so far as to wear white contact lenses to \"prove\" his blindness. After several months, the feud culminated in a match at [[WrestleMania VII]], in which both contestants were blindfolded (though both Roberts and Martel did later confess to having some limited vision due to the lights in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The bout ended after Roberts was able to \"locate\" Martel and deliver a DDT.\n\n====Various feuds and departure (1991\u20131992)====\nIn early to mid-1991, Roberts engaged in a feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] who \"squashed\" Damien with a pair of [[professional wrestling attacks#Senton|Earthquake splashes]] during their match on the April 27 (taped March 26) edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Graham\n|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1991|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> In reality, Roberts' bag contained hamburger meat intended to look like a snake and a small mechanical device to depict movement.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/henry6.htm|first=Justin|last=Henry|date=January 2, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2016|title=The Dominance of a Natural Disaster}}</ref> The feud was advanced when, several weeks later, Earthquake appeared on ''WWF Prime Time Wrestling'' and served \"Quakeburgers\" to co-host [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]] and [[Vince McMahon]], later claiming that the meat was ground from Damien's carcass.<ref name=\"Wrestlecrap\">{{cite book | authors=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap \u2013 the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press | year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre }}</ref> Roberts later introduced a new snake, Damien's \"big brother\" Lucifer.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Michael|last=Moore|title=Collectible News: Action Figure Spotlight - 40-inch \"Damien\" snake|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_64264.shtml#.V4Anl7grLIV|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1991 there were a series of televised vignettes featuring the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]] turning to Roberts for help in his feud with [[The Undertaker]]. In the set-up, Roberts explained to Warrior that, after passing three tests, he would have the \"knowledge of the dark side\" to defeat Undertaker. The segments included Warrior being locked inside a coffin (a reprise of an incident that occurred on ''The Funeral Parlor'', hosted by the Undertaker's manager, [[Paul Bearer]]; earlier in the year); the Warrior being \"buried alive\" in dirt before being abandoned; and Warrior walking through a room full of live snakes to reach a chest containing \"the answer\". During the latter segment, the Warrior opened the chest, only to be immediately bitten by a [[king cobra]] (actually a rubber prop). As Warrior \"weakened\" from the effects of the cobra's strike, Roberts was joined by The Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70 70\u201371]|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6|url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70}}</ref> Roberts closed the final segment by proclaiming, ''\"Never trust a snake\"'', turning Roberts [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time since 1987.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|pages=47\u201348|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}</ref> A series of matches were planned, but the feud was canceled after the Ultimate Warrior was fired by the WWF the night of [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter SummerSlam, Roberts was placed in a feud with [[Randy Savage]]. During the post-SummerSlam wedding reception of Savage and [[Miss Elizabeth]] (in reality they had been married since 1984), Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live cobra.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Sporting News|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/wwe/list/wwe-summerslam-best-moments-randy-savage-shawn-michaels-bret-hart-john-cena-brock-lesnar/8sknr46ybywb1vfpr0c19tmw3/slide/1|accessdate=July 5, 2010|title=Macho Man marries Elizabeth -- 1991|first=Brian|last=Fritz|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Roberts and the Undertaker attacked Savage, until [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] ran them off. A short feud with Sid ensued when Sid was scheduled to wrestle \"El Diablo\" and the Undertaker came out and accepted the challenge to face Sid. Paul Bearer offered \"El Diablo\" what appeared to be a bribe to walk away. As the match began, \"El Diablo\" came back to the ring and hit Sid. Then \"El Diablo\" unmasked revealing himself as Jake. Roberts proceeded to unleash a king cobra on Sid, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan intervened. Sid and Jake wrestled on ''Superstars'' a week later. But soon, Sid injured his biceps, which forced the feud to end.<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nRoberts immediately began berating Randy Savage in a series of promos, aware that Savage \u2014 who had lost a retirement match to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII \u2014 was unable to exact revenge. During an October 21 taping for ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Roberts goaded Savage into the ring and brutally attacked him, eventually tying Savage into the ropes and got the king cobra to bite his arm; the snake was devenomized and, according to Roberts' DVD ''Pick Your Poison'', he had trouble getting the cobra to release his bite. According to Roberts, on the day the angle was shot, he had to let the cobra bite him on his leg at Savage's request to convince him that the snake had been devenomized and Savage would regularly check on Roberts to make sure he had no side effects from the bite. The segment went on longer than planned, and Savage's blood was clearly visible as it dripped from the puncture wounds.\n\nWWF president [[Jack Tunney]] reinstated Savage as an active wrestler to get revenge for the attack. To explain the absence of the cobra, Tunney \"banned\" Roberts from ever bringing a snake to the ring again. Savage and Roberts feuded for the next few months. Their first match was at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] [[pay-per-view]] on December 3 in San Antonio, Texas, which saw Savage earn a victory over Roberts and Roberts slap Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued through the early part of 1992 and included Savage eliminating Roberts from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match. The feud ended on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', with Savage getting the win. Roberts, livid at having lost to him and having received two of Savage's flying elbow drops (one of which after the match), was helped backstage. Enraged, he grabbed a steel chair and said that he was going to hit whoever came backstage first, whether it was Savage or Elizabeth. Just as Roberts was about to swing the chair, he was stopped by the Undertaker; Roberts was distracted long enough for Savage to hit him with the chair instead. That incident helped set up Roberts' feud with the Undertaker. Roberts appeared on ''The Funeral Parlor'' to demand answers from the Undertaker about why he stopped him from attacking Elizabeth. When Roberts was dissatisfied with the answers, he hit Bearer with a DDT and, after jamming Undertaker's hand in a coffin, began hitting him with a steel chair; however, Undertaker got up after each chair shot and eventually chased Roberts backstage dragging the coffin behind him. At [[WrestleMania VIII]], Roberts lost the match, [[Undefeated WrestleMania streak of The Undertaker|becoming the second man to lose to The Undertaker at WrestleMania]].<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nThe WrestleMania VIII match turned out to be Roberts' last for the WWF for nearly four years. His departure came after he was upset that WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]] did not offer him a position on the writing staff, despite being promised such previously. After [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] stepped down from his post on the writing staff stemming from the recent sexual harassment scandal, McMahon decided that, out of respect for Patterson, the spot would be left vacant. Roberts felt he was not only being lied to, but also being betrayed. In response, he threatened to [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-show]] WrestleMania if he was not given a release from his contract. On his 'Pick Your Poison' DVD, Roberts expressed his regret for his actions to get a release from his contract.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1992)===\nRoberts went on to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) alongside his father, [[Grizzly Smith]], where he aligned himself with [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] to feud against [[Steve Borden|Sting]] and [[Nikita Koloff]]. However, before he could officially join WCW, he had to wait 90 days. According to the ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD, Roberts had initially signed a lucrative contract under Kip Allen Frey, who was running WCW at the time. On the 87th day, Frey stepped down and was replaced by [[Bill Watts]], for whom Roberts had [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] with back in his days at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. Ultimately, Roberts estimates that he went from making about $3.5 million a year to approximately $200,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/03/01/the-smark-dvd-rant-for-jake-roberts-pick-your-poison/|title=The SmarK DVD Rant for Jake Roberts: Pick Your Poison {{!}} Inside Pulse|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made his first television appearance on August 2, 1992 at a ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' taping in Baltimore, Maryland after coming through the crowd to attack [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw92.htm|website=History of WCW|title=History of WCW|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> His first WCW match came six days later when he defeated [[Marcus Alexander Bagwell]] on a house show in Chicago, Illinois. He would quickly form an alliance with Cactus Jack and The Barbarian. His first major TV wrestling appearance for WCW was at ''[[Clash of the Champions XX]]'', where his team won a 4-man elimination tag match. Roberts scored a pinfall victory over Sting, which built their feud further. His single WCW [[pay-per-view]] match was against Sting at [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]] in 1992. Their match was determined via the [[Professional wrestling match types#Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal|Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]].<ref name=mf229>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.229)</ref> There was a series of gimmick matches on the wheel, but because the wheel itself was not gimmicked, neither Roberts nor Sting knew the kind of match they would be wrestling until the wheel stopped spinning. When the wheel stopped, it had landed on what many observers believed was the worst option \u2014 the [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Coal Miner's Glove match]]. While Halloween Havoc was the company's top-selling PPV for several years,<ref name=mf229/> Roberts soon left WCW.\n\nFollowing the loss to Sting he continued his feud, facing him on several house shows immediately after the event. On the November 2 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'', [[Tony Schiavone]] conducted a sit-down interview with Roberts regarding the decision of Bill Watts to ban his bringing of the snake to ringside, and his impending first round match against [[Dustin Rhodes]] in the first round of the King of Cable tournament. He was replaced in the tournament by [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].\n\n=== Various promotions (1993\u20131994)===\nAfter leaving WCW, Roberts spent his next couple of years wrestling around the world. In February 1993, he took part in a tour in Australia. He won the [[American Wrestling Federation]] Heavyweight Title defeating [[Don Muraco]] on March 4. Then in April 1993, he toured Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. In September 1993, he took part wrestling a tour for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nRoberts debuted in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] promotion [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) in April 1993, causing the defeat of [[Konnan]] in the career vs. career match at [[Tripleman\u00eda I]]. Roberts' run-in started a feud that lasted until 1994 at [[Tripleman\u00eda II-C]], in which Konnan defeated Roberts in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. hair match]].\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Roberts returned to the United States to wrestle for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). On May 2, he defeated [[Tony Anthony]] to win the [[SMW Heavyweight Championship]]; the title change aired on May 14. Roberts no-showed several defenses, forcing SMW to give the title back to Anthony on July 5. By the end of 1994, Roberts took a hiatus.\n\n===Return to WWF (1996\u20131997)===\n{{details|The Attitude Era}}\nAfter spending over a year in hiatus, Roberts returned to WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in 1996, as a [[Bible]]-preacher.<ref name=mf229/> To go along with his new gimmick, his new Albino Burmese Python was named \"[[Book of Revelation|Revelations]].\" His gimmick also mirrored his real life, as Roberts had recently become a [[born-again Christian]] and had been preaching around the country.<ref name=mf229/>\n\n[[Image:Jake Roberts in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roberts and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] in 1996]]\nDuring his second tenure with the company, Roberts was pushed as a \"[[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] story\" and faced [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in the final match of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996]] [[King of the Ring tournament]]. Changes had to be made to the match's scripting as legitimate injuries sustained earlier in the evening in a match with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] left Roberts unable to engage in the longer, more evenly matched bout originally intended between the men. In order to prevent Roberts from sustaining further injury, he was quickly defeated by Austin; in a post-match interview, Austin mocked his recital of the biblical passage [[John 3:16]] by saying ''\"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your [[Psalms]], talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\"''.<ref name=mf229/> The [[catchphrase]] helped propel Austin to the top of the WWF, and is one of the moments that is often cited as the beginning of \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". Roberts next feuded with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]], who went to great lengths to ridicule Roberts' past [[alcoholism]].\n\nIn early 1997, the WWF wanted Roberts to wind down his in-ring career and to join the backstage side of the company. Since he still loved to wrestle, he did not make this transition well. This led to a relapse with drugs and alcohol. He appeared at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] where he entered at no. 7 and was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. His last match with WWF was at ''Shotgun Saturday Night'' on January 25, 1997 against [[Salvatore Sincere]] in a winning effort. He was released in February 1997.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997\u20131998)===\nDuring the summer of 1997, Roberts debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. His introduction came towards the end of a match between Lawler and [[Tommy Dreamer]], which was the main event of the show. As the match went on, the arena lights were turned off. Moments later when the lights came back on, Roberts was already in the ring, and proceeded to give Tommy Dreamer a clothesline. He then went to the camera man and screamed; \"''Your God... he giveth, and he can taketh away. My God, he giveth... but he ain't got the balls to do nothin' else''.\" He promptly clotheslined Lawler, who fell onto Dreamer for a two count before exiting the ring.\n\nRoberts also teamed with [[Tommy Dreamer]] at the 1998 [[November to Remember]] as his mystery partner against [[Justin Credible]] and [[Jack Victory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme Championship Wrestling Results (1998)|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw/1998.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u2013present)===\nIn October 1999, Roberts was one of several former NWA, WWF, and ECW wrestlers brought in to compete in the first ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' event in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. He was booked to face [[Jim Neidhart]] in one half of the card's double main event in what was billed as a \"special grudge match\" between the two. Roberts was so intoxicated that during the course of the night, he slurred his way through a promo before the match and staggered to, from, and around the ring during his entrance. After doing such things as pretending his snake was a penis and stroking it like he was masturbating and attempting to kiss the snake with his tongue, the show's promoter sent [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], who were supposed to compete in the other main event match, to the ring and made the main event a tag team match with Roberts teaming with Yokozuna against Bundy and Neidhart. Roberts, who was so drunk that he could not stand up, took the fall in the match after Bundy splashed and pinned him.\n\nIn 2001, Roberts moved to [[Great Britain]], where he began competing for Brian Dixon's [[All Star Wrestling]]. In December, he made his debut for [[Ricky Knight]]'s [[World Association of Wrestling]] in [[Lowestoft]]. On October 20, 2002, Roberts became the NWA UK Hammerlock Heavyweight Champion in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], [[England]] by defeating \"Vigilante\" Johnny Moss. Moss regained the title the next night in [[Ashford, Kent]], though. In November 2002, Roberts started his own wrestling promotion in the UK, called \"Real Stars of Wrestling\". RSOW ran three events, each headlined by Roberts vs. The Honky Tonk Man.\n\nRoberts made his final British appearance at WAW's ''October Outrage'' show in Canvey Island, Essex, once again teaming with Steve Quintain against the [[UK Pitbulls]]. However, Roberts turned up at the show \"in no fit state to compete\", but went ahead with his match. Roberts cut a drunken promo paying tribute to [[Ray Traylor]], who had died a few days before, and almost got into a scuffle with several WAW wrestlers who were sent out to defuse the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = smackdown-raw-superstars-nxt \u2013 Jake Roberts|url = http://mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com/post/189|website = mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com|access-date = February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made an appearance at [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]'s Houston-based [[Reality of Wrestling|Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (PWA) promotion, in which he cut a promo urging those who want to enter the wrestling business to not follow along his path. At one point, he said he loved the wrestling business more than anything else in the world. PWA wrestler \"Rockstar\" Robbie Gillmore then interrupted Roberts and attempted to make an alliance based upon the fact that Robbie wears an 80s style shirt featuring a cobra. Roberts had just said all he ever wanted was a little respect, and the Rockstar's interruption irritated him. Roberts then attacked Gillmore.\n\nOn October 6, 2007 he lost to [[Scott Hall]] at [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn May 2009, Roberts joined the [[Jim Rose Circus]] for the ''Jim Rose Circus vs. Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts: The Legends Collide Tour''. Advertised as \"a grueling 40 city campaign\" containing pretty girls, wrestling, amazing circus stunts, and a fist fight, the tour features [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose]] and wrestler [[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn Bodhi]] as \"Team Jake\".\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Roberts wrestled what was billed as his retirement match, when he defeated Sinn Bodhi at the [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG) show during the [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 5|WrestleReunion 5]] weekend.<ref name=WrestleReunion5>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_47214.shtml|title=1/29 PWG results in Los Angeles: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of PWG Title match, Kaval vs. Davey, Roberts retirement, Legends Battle Royal|last=Massingham|first=Matt|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2013, Roberts returned to the ring for First State Championship Wrestling, a Delaware-based wrestling promotion, as part of an eight-man tag team main event.

He worked with the company to create a [[DVD]] retrospective of his career (the aforementioned ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD), which was released later that year.\n\nIn 2013, Roberts announced his desire to return to WWE as a participant in the [[Royal Rumble (2014)|2014 Royal Rumble]].<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nOn January 6, 2014, Roberts made an appearance on the \"Old School\" episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', laying a python over the face of an unconscious [[Dean Ambrose]].<ref name=resurrection/> Notably, although Ambrose's onscreen character was unconscious, he himself was visibly attempting not to smile during the segment as Roberts had been his favorite wrestler during his childhood.

Once he reached the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 1986, Roberts would bring a live [[Burmese Python]] (though various snakes were used over the years, most were named \"Damien\") to ringside in a canvas bag. Other snakes used were a [[python reticulatus|Reticulated Python]] named Lucifer, an unnamed (de-venomized) [[Cobra]], and an albino Burmese Python named Revelations (during Roberts' Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the pin, Roberts would coil the constrictor around the opponent's neck, and the snake would slither around on top of the fallen wrestler, sometimes appearing to strangle him.\n\nRoberts has been praised by his fellow wrestlers for his psychology in the ring.<ref name=resurrection/> [[Jim Ross]] has stated that Roberts stands out for not only his ring psychology, but also his promo work.<ref name=resurrection>{{cite video|title=The Resurrection of Jake the Snake|year=2015|people=Yu, Steve (director)|medium=Documentary|publisher=Slamdance}}</ref> [[Ted DiBiase]] has stated how much he enjoyed working with Roberts,<ref name=resurrection/> while [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] rated Roberts as the second best worker he worked with.

According to social media the tour was to feature \"an uncensored night of comedy, stories from the road, Q&A and more\". The tour kicked off on November 6, 2018 at the Lookout Lounge in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\n==Other media==\nIn the late 1980s, Roberts made a guest appearance on the DJ Kat Show on Fox, challenging DJ to a match after the Kat had badmouthed the profession.\n\nIn 1996, Roberts, Vader, and [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' for one episode.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=WrestleCrap|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/inductions/boy-meets-vader-because-every-tgif-sitcom-needs-a-mastadon/|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=July 9, 2016|title=Boy Meets Vader: Because Every TGIF Sitcom Needs a {{sic|Masta|don|nolink=y}}!}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Roberts was unflatteringly featured in the wrestling documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. Throughout the film, he made confessions about his tragic past, including the murder of his sister by her husband's ex-wife and the collapse of his marriage. Amongst the more disturbing moments was Roberts reportedly smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]] in a hotel room after a reunion with his daughter Brandy, though the act is not shown on camera. In 2005, Roberts, along with others, heavily criticized the film for showing him in a negative light, complaining that the depiction of him was \"not the real Jake Roberts.\" Roberts also stated that director Barry Blaustein and [[Terry Funk]] lied to him about the aims of the film, telling him it was a [[television special]] on the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nRoberts was featured in another wrestling documentary in 2015 entitled ''The Resurrection of Jake the Snake'', which chronicled his time living with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] beginning in October 2012.<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nRoberts appeared as Mr. Lucas, the owner of a gourmet condom company, in the comedy film, ''[[The Bet (2016 film)|The Bet]]'' which also featured Dallas Page and [[Roddy Piper]].\n\nRoberts also made an appearance in ''An Almost True Story: TOXIC TUTU'' in 2015, as himself, in a scene with [[Jonny Fairplay]] from ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.\n\nRoberts has a role in the 2019 film ''[[The Peanut Butter Falcon]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Health issues===\nIn 2007, WWE started a policy of paying all expenses for its former performers who wanted to start [[drug rehabilitation]] programs.

It was produced by [[Karan Johar]], Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the banner [[Dharma Productions]], and was distributed by [[Fox Star Studios]]. A sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Student of the Year]]'', it stars [[Tiger Shroff]], [[Tara Sutaria]] and [[Ananya Panday]]. The film follows Rohan Sachdev, a college student who switches to a better university to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sweetheart who studies there. When Rohan is rusticated, he returns to his old college and vows to lead his new team to victory in an inter-college cup against his former college, thereby becoming Student of the Year.\nIt was heavily panned by critics and audience alike and it holds a rating of 7% on Rotten tomatoes.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/student_of_the_year_2</ref>\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was announced in November 2017. Initially, Malhotra and Shroff were to collaborate for a different film; when they found the final script unsatisfactory, they tweaked it and planned to make it a sequel. It marks the debut of both Sutaria and Panday, and pursues a plot that is unrelated to its predecessor. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in April 2018 at [[Dehradun]], and ended in September 2018.

His relationship with former classmate and childhood sweetheart Mridula Chawla is affected when Mridula transfers to St. Teresa's High School, a college in Dehradun for the wealthy and privileged. Rohan is unable to afford their fees and is left back, but vows to make his cut. To be together with Mridula, he applies for a scholarship under the sports quota in the college and manages to gain admission. Meanwhile, Mridula has changed her identity and rechristened herself as Mia Chawla to fit in with others at her new college. Upon meeting Rohan, she initially stays away from him because of his relatively inferior spark, but they soon begin a relationship again, after Rohan starts being recognized as a sportsman.\n\nRohan is introduced to Manav Singh Randhawa, a rich and affluent student and two-time winner of the Student of the Year Cup. The two become quick friends, but Rohan remains at loggerheads with Manav's sister Shreya Randhawa, who appears to be a spoilt brat and detests him, often playing pranks on him that cause him trouble. Manav organizes a superhero-themed birthday party for his friends where Rohan and Mia are invited, but a prank by Shreya results in Rohan's friends from Pishorilal Chamandas getting insulted and beaten, only for them to disown Rohan, who realizes that the prank was Shreya's brainchild. Friction between the two reaches an alarming height when Shreya sprays Rohan's bicycle fully pink as he had used her parking space. A private meeting in Principal Gujral's office is called for, and Shreya's father, college chief trustee Sukesh Randhawa, slaps Shreya, and walks away giving word to Rohan for a compensation for the damage. Rohan tries to convince her for a healthy friendship, but Shreya rebuffs his proposal, taking the slap to heart.\n\nThe college, meanwhile, announces a dance competition, where Rohan and Mia are set up against Manav and Shreya. Mia wishes to win the contest and attain popularity, while Shreya wants to convince Sukesh of her skills in dance and enroll in a dance school in London. Manav and Shreya win the contest after Mia falters during a step. When Rohan goes to console Mia, he instead finds her getting intimate with Manav, and realises that Manav, knowing Mia had a crush on him, had planted her to spoil Rohan's performance since he saw him as a threat to his image.\n\nRohan punches Manav, and is expelled from St. Teresa's. Before leaving the campus, Manav and his gang attack Rohan and beat him vigorously, throwing him out of the campus gate unconscious. Initially finding himself struggling to deal with what he sees as Mia's betrayal, he goes back and challenges Manav saying he, and not Manav, will be winning the Student of the Year trophy in 2019.\n\nRohan then returns back to Pishorilal Chamandas, where his old friends treat him with coldness and contempt. Shreya, who is impressed by Rohan's sincerity, convinces his friends to warm up to him, falling in love with him in the process after he helps her win a local dance competition and drops about her house to tell Sukesh that he should be proud of his daughter. Shreya reveals to Rohan that her mother's sudden demise upon her birth led Sukesh and Manav to consider her an ill omen for the house. At this point, Manav has already found out about Rohan and Shreya and tells the latter to refrain from meeting the former, misinterpreting Rohan's company with her as a sign of revenge, but she rebukes him. Rohan continues to avoid Mia despite her efforts to talk to him.\n\nHowever, a day after the local dance competition which he has helped Shreya win, Rohan finds Mia at his doorstep while hanging out with Shreya, and all three of them find out that a love triangle has taken them up when Mia reveals that she sent unattended letters to Rohan upon realizing that Manav was a cheater. Although she initially thinks Rohan and Mia would get back together, Rohan affirms his genuine love for Shreya through a warm, affectionate hug just as she is about to leave the hospital after visiting Rohan's rival Abhishek, who was left severely wounded after Manav and his friends beat him and Rohan's other classmates up. This was during a fight that broke out between the two student factions due to the comments thrown at Manav during the inauguration of the 29th Annual Inter-College Dignity Cup, an intercollegiate competition where Pishorilal has been finishing at the bottom of the chart for the past few years. Mia realizes that she has lost Rohan for good. Abhishek then makes amends and peace with Rohan, and they decide to fight back as a team when the former realizes that the latter risked himself in the fight.\n\nRohan and his teammates train hard to win the Dignity Cup, and Pishorilal Chamandas begins climbing up the score chart, getting a close second to St. Teresa's. Meanwhile, a saddened Mia hangs out with Rohan one night, when he tells her that he won't repeat a mistake he made while imagining their relationship, which was to assume her as his only goal in life. Mia leaves, dejected, but is fully satisfied and happy for Rohan and his newfound purpose in life, and she does not return to Manav. On the eve of the finale between St. Teresa's and Pishorilal Chamandas, an anxious Rohan proposes to Shreya, who accepts his love, and encourages him to fight for the right. Even though Manav and his teammates engage in foul play against Rohan's team, Rohan single-handedly takes them down after a bonus chance, gaining two extra points ahead of the rivals. All-time winner St.Teresa's loses the Dignity Cup for the first time, Rohan holding the trophy up high and became Student of the Year for the first time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tiger Shroff]] as Rohan Sachdev\n* [[Tara Sutaria]] as Mridula \"Mia\" Chawla\n* [[Ananya Panday]] as Shreya Randhawa\n* [[Aditya Seal]] as Manav Singh Randhawa\n* [[Samir Soni]] as Principal Avinash Gujral\n* [[Gul Panag]] as Coach Kuljeet Chaddha\n* [[Abhishek Bajaj]] as Abhishek Sharma\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Coach Mahipal<ref name=\"mumbai\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/tiger-shroff-shoots-with-ananya-pandey-tara-sutaria-for-soty-2-1781757-2.html |title=Tiger Shroff Shoots With Ananya Panday & Tara Sutaria For SOTY 2 |date=18 June 2018 |work=[[CNN-News18]] |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Principal Archana Singh\n* [[Rajesh Kumar (actor)|Rajesh Kumar]] as Prem Narayan Sachdev, Rohan's uncle \n* [[Manasi Joshi Roy]] as Sushmita Sachdev, Rohan's aunt\n* [[Chetan Pandit]] as Sukesh Randhawa, Shreya and Manav's father\n* Samreen Kaur as Manorama Chawla, Mia's mother\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Commentator Dimpy\n* [[Sahil Anand]] as Commentator Jeet Khurana\n* Daljeet Singh as Abdullah Wahab\n* Harsh Beniwal as Puggi\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] (special appearance in \"The Hook Up Song\")\n* Suryansh Kapoor as Junior Rohan\n* [[Will Smith]] (special appearance in \"The Jawaani Song\")\n* [[Farah Khan]] (special appearance as judge of \"The Jawaani Song\")\n* [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] (special appearance as judge of \"The Jawaani Song\")\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and casting ===\n''Student of the Year 2'' is a sequel to the 2012 [[Karan Johar]]-directed romantic comedy-drama ''[[Student of the Year]]''.<ref name=\"khatter\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/movies/student-of-the-year-2-karan-johar-quashes-reports-of-ishaan-khatter-featuring-with-tiger-shroff-in-film-1585495.html |title=Student of The Year 2: Karan Johar Quashes Reports of Ishaan Khatter Featuring With Tiger Shroff In Film |date=23 November 2017 |work=[[CNN-News18]] |access-date=8 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430141412/https://www.news18.com/news/movies/student-of-the-year-2-karan-johar-quashes-reports-of-ishaan-khatter-featuring-with-tiger-shroff-in-film-1585495.html |archive-date=30 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly after the commercial success of the first film, a sequel was announced by the producers.<ref name=\"tiger\" /> In November 2017, a press release by [[Dharma Productions]] revealed that the sequel is slated to release in 2018; it would be directed by [[Punit Malhotra]] and star [[Tiger Shroff]] in one of the leading roles.<ref name=\"tiger\" /> The film was announced four years after Malhotra's previous directorial ''[[Gori Tere Pyaar Mein]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"indiatoday.intoday.in\" /> It was to be produced in association by Johar's Dharma Productions and [[Fox Star Studios]].<ref name=\"tiger\" /> The film's announcement by the company initially conflated with that of their another production, ''[[Dhadak]]'' (2018), which roused speculation that Ishaan Khatter would star in the film.

It was produced by [[Karan Johar]], Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the banner [[Dharma Productions]], and was distributed by [[Fox Star Studios]]. A sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Student of the Year]]'', it stars [[Tiger Shroff]], [[Tara Sutaria]] and [[Ananya Panday]]. The film follows Rohan Sachdev, a college student who switches to a better university to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sweetheart who studies there. When Rohan is rusticated, he returns to his old college and vows to lead his new team to victory in an inter-college cup against his former college, thereby becoming Student of the Year.\nIt was heavily panned by critics and audience alike and it holds a rating of 7% on Rotten tomatoes.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/student_of_the_year_2</ref>\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was announced in November 2017. Initially, Malhotra and Shroff were to collaborate for a different film; when they found the final script unsatisfactory, they tweaked it and planned to make it a sequel. It marks the debut of both Sutaria and Panday, and pursues a plot that is unrelated to its predecessor. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in April 2018 at [[Dehradun]], and ended in September 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Vishal-Shekhar]], with lyrics written by [[Anvita Dutt Guptan]], [[Kumaar]] and Vayu, and released under the banner [[Zee Music Company]].\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was theatrically released in India on 10 May 2019. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with the script, unreal situation and unrealistic depiction of Indian schools thus receiving criticism; Shroff's action sequences were praised. As of 7 June 2019, it has earned {{INR|link=yes}}97.81 [[crore]] worldwide, against a budget of {{INR}}65 crore, including promotion and advertising costs.<!--Sourced in body, do not remove-->\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=December 2019}} <!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nRohan Sachdev is a middle class student of the Pishorilal Chamandas College in [[Mussoorie]]. His relationship with former classmate and childhood sweetheart Mridula Chawla is affected when Mridula transfers to St. Teresa's High School, a college in Dehradun for the wealthy and privileged. Rohan is unable to afford their fees and is left back, but vows to make his cut. To be together with Mridula, he applies for a scholarship under the sports quota in the college and manages to gain admission. Meanwhile, Mridula has changed her identity and rechristened herself as Mia Chawla to fit in with others at her new college. Upon meeting Rohan, she initially stays away from him because of his relatively inferior spark, but they soon begin a relationship again, after Rohan starts being recognized as a sportsman.\n\nRohan is introduced to Manav Singh Randhawa, a rich and affluent student and two-time winner of the Student of the Year Cup. The two become quick friends, but Rohan remains at loggerheads with Manav's sister Shreya Randhawa, who appears to be a spoilt brat and detests him, often playing pranks on him that cause him trouble. Manav organizes a superhero-themed birthday party for his friends where Rohan and Mia are invited, but a prank by Shreya results in Rohan's friends from Pishorilal Chamandas getting insulted and beaten, only for them to disown Rohan, who realizes that the prank was Shreya's brainchild. Friction between the two reaches an alarming height when Shreya sprays Rohan's bicycle fully pink as he had used her parking space. A private meeting in Principal Gujral's office is called for, and Shreya's father, college chief trustee Sukesh Randhawa, slaps Shreya, and walks away giving word to Rohan for a compensation for the damage. Rohan tries to convince her for a healthy friendship, but Shreya rebuffs his proposal, taking the slap to heart.\n\nThe college, meanwhile, announces a dance competition, where Rohan and Mia are set up against Manav and Shreya. Mia wishes to win the contest and attain popularity, while Shreya wants to convince Sukesh of her skills in dance and enroll in a dance school in London. Manav and Shreya win the contest after Mia falters during a step. When Rohan goes to console Mia, he instead finds her getting intimate with Manav, and realises that Manav, knowing Mia had a crush on him, had planted her to spoil Rohan's performance since he saw him as a threat to his image.\n\nRohan punches Manav, and is expelled from St. Teresa's. Before leaving the campus, Manav and his gang attack Rohan and beat him vigorously, throwing him out of the campus gate unconscious. Initially finding himself struggling to deal with what he sees as Mia's betrayal, he goes back and challenges Manav saying he, and not Manav, will be winning the Student of the Year trophy in 2019.\n\nRohan then returns back to Pishorilal Chamandas, where his old friends treat him with coldness and contempt. Shreya, who is impressed by Rohan's sincerity, convinces his friends to warm up to him, falling in love with him in the process after he helps her win a local dance competition and drops about her house to tell Sukesh that he should be proud of his daughter. Shreya reveals to Rohan that her mother's sudden demise upon her birth led Sukesh and Manav to consider her an ill omen for the house. At this point, Manav has already found out about Rohan and Shreya and tells the latter to refrain from meeting the former, misinterpreting Rohan's company with her as a sign of revenge, but she rebukes him. Rohan continues to avoid Mia despite her efforts to talk to him.\n\nHowever, a day after the local dance competition which he has helped Shreya win, Rohan finds Mia at his doorstep while hanging out with Shreya, and all three of them find out that a love triangle has taken them up when Mia reveals that she sent unattended letters to Rohan upon realizing that Manav was a cheater. Although she initially thinks Rohan and Mia would get back together, Rohan affirms his genuine love for Shreya through a warm, affectionate hug just as she is about to leave the hospital after visiting Rohan's rival Abhishek, who was left severely wounded after Manav and his friends beat him and Rohan's other classmates up. This was during a fight that broke out between the two student factions due to the comments thrown at Manav during the inauguration of the 29th Annual Inter-College Dignity Cup, an intercollegiate competition where Pishorilal has been finishing at the bottom of the chart for the past few years. Mia realizes that she has lost Rohan for good. Abhishek then makes amends and peace with Rohan, and they decide to fight back as a team when the former realizes that the latter risked himself in the fight.\n\nRohan and his teammates train hard to win the Dignity Cup, and Pishorilal Chamandas begins climbing up the score chart, getting a close second to St. Teresa's. Meanwhile, a saddened Mia hangs out with Rohan one night, when he tells her that he won't repeat a mistake he made while imagining their relationship, which was to assume her as his only goal in life. Mia leaves, dejected, but is fully satisfied and happy for Rohan and his newfound purpose in life, and she does not return to Manav. On the eve of the finale between St. Teresa's and Pishorilal Chamandas, an anxious Rohan proposes to Shreya, who accepts his love, and encourages him to fight for the right. Even though Manav and his teammates engage in foul play against Rohan's team, Rohan single-handedly takes them down after a bonus chance, gaining two extra points ahead of the rivals.

Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
