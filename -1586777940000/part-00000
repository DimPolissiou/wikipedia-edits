The first aircraft made was a licensed [[Farman]] IV with ENV engine, which made its first flight on 18 August 1910.  From there, in addition to copies, some improvements were designed for existing models. The first of these was a Farman VII in 1912 with some improvements that were put into production. A more ambitious project was the [[Dux Meller I]] which combined a Bleriot main fuselage with a Farman XV nacelle added, all driven by a 100&nbsp;hp [[Gnome-Rhone]] in [[pusher configuration]]. A modified Farman XVI was later produced under the name [[Dux Meller II]] and flown in 1913. The following [[Dux Meller III]] was a failed attempt to produce a single-engine twin-propeller chain-driven monoplane.  Further work went into the [[Dux No 2]] but this was also a failure.  While engineering continued on a new twin engine pusher, in the end the factory's primary activity was construction of Western designs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| '''Summary of aircraft built by Dux'''\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

In 1958 it shifted its production to rockets, and became known as the [[Samara Progress plant]].<ref name=\"voenniypar\"/>\n\n===Plant #30===\n{{main|Moscow Aircraft Production Association}}\nPlant #30 was established in 1939 in [[Dubna]].<ref name=\"tpru\">{{cite web|title=\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u2116 30 \u2014 \u0418\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438|url=http://testpilot.ru/az_map/avia/zavod-30/|website=Testpilot.ru|accessdate=29 July 2017|language=ru-RU}}</ref> In December 1941 it was relocated to the former site of Plant #1, where it manufactured the [[Ilyushin Il-2]].<ref name=\"tpru\"/> In 1950 it merged with Plant #381, to produce the [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] in larger volumes.<ref name=\"tpru\"/> In 1953 [[Lukhovitsy Machine Building Plant]] was established as a subsidiary of the plant.<ref name=\"zhkd\">{{cite news|title=\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430|url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/399484|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=\u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \"\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044a \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438\"|date=28 July 2003|pages=36}}</ref>\n\nPlant #30 became known as the ''Znamya Truda Machine-Building Plant'' in 1965,<ref name=\"voenniypar\"/> and as the [[Moscow Aircraft Production Organisation]] in 1973.<ref name=\"tpru\"/>\n\nThe [[MiG-29]] was put in production. Civil programs include [[MiG-AT]], T-101, T-411, and Aviatika MAI-890 aircraft. After this the following aircraft were produced: [[Su-9]], [[Yak-25]], [[Ilyushin Il-14|Il-14]], [[Ilyushin Il-18|Il-18]] with modifications, [[MiG-21]], and [[MiG-23]].\n\n===Plant #32===\n{{main|Avitek}}\nPlant #32 was established in 1932, when it was separated from Plant #1.<ref name=\"voenniypar\"/> In 1941 it was evacuated to [[Kirov, Russia|Kirov]], becoming the [[Kirov Machine-Building Plant]] in 1960 and the [[Vyatka Machine Building Enterprise AVITEK]] in the 1990s.<ref name=\"voenniypar\"/>\n\n===Plant #39===\n{{main|Irkutsk Aviation Plant}}\nPlant #39 produced the [[Ilyushin Il-4|DB-3F]] before evacuation in October 1941.

Plant #381 also produced the [[Ilyushin Il-12|Il-12]], a small series of I-250, and the first 75 of [[MiG-15]]. In 1950 it was merged into Plant #30.<ref name=\"voenniypar\"/>\n\n==Aircraft==\nThe majority of types built by Dux were French and other Western aircraft designs. The first aircraft made was a licensed [[Farman]] IV with ENV engine, which made its first flight on 18 August 1910.  From there, in addition to copies, some improvements were designed for existing models. The first of these was a Farman VII in 1912 with some improvements that were put into production. A more ambitious project was the [[Dux Meller I]] which combined a Bleriot main fuselage with a Farman XV nacelle added, all driven by a 100&nbsp;hp [[Gnome-Rhone]] in [[pusher configuration]]. A modified Farman XVI was later produced under the name [[Dux Meller II]] and flown in 1913. The following [[Dux Meller III]] was a failed attempt to produce a single-engine twin-propeller chain-driven monoplane.  Further work went into the [[Dux No 2]] but this was also a failure.  While engineering continued on a new twin engine pusher, in the end the factory's primary activity was construction of Western designs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| '''Summary of aircraft built by Dux'''\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
