He pointed to figures from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which found that Sellafield was responsible for only one per cent. of radioactivity in Ireland, and went on to \"award the star prize for political humbuggery to the Irish, to the inhabitants of the Emerald Isle\".<ref name=\"Shut down Ireland\">Niall Moonan, \"Brit MEP: Shut down Ireland, not Sellafield\", ''Daily Mirror'', 24 December 2001, p. 11.</ref> He became the Labour group agriculture spokesman and was critical of the group of Welsh farmers who had given evidence during an inquiry into the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|outbreak of foot and mouth disease]], saying they \"might be a bit biased\".<ref name=\"FMD bias\">Robert Uhlig, \"MEPs question foot and mouth victims' politics\", ''Daily Telegraph'', 3 July 2002, p. 6.</ref> When the eventual report was highly critical of the British government, Adam abstained rather than support it, describing the report as inaccurate.<ref name=\"Abstention on FMD\">\"Report slams foot and mouth policy\", ''Western Morning News'', 21 November 2002.</ref>\n\n==Mayoral candidate==\nWhen the directly-elected [[Mayor of North Tyneside]] resigned in 2003, forcing a byelection for the Mayoralty, Adam was chosen as the Labour candidate.<ref name=\"North Tyneside Mayoral candidate\">\"Anger at Labour's mayor poll choice\", ''The Journal'', 8 May 2003, p. 13.</ref> He was defeated by [[Linda Arkley]] who secured a majority of 4,861.<ref name=\"Defeated for Mayor\">\"Tory nurse beats Labour MEP\", ''The Guardian'', 13 June 2003, p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Allowances==\nIn April 2004 Austrian MEP [[Hans-Peter Martin]] was attempting to expose questionable practices in European Parliament allowances. Martin filmed Adam signing the attendance book for a Friday session of the European Parliament, thereby claiming a daily allowance, before immediately leaving. Martin claimed that Adam tried to grab his video camera, knocking Martin off his feet and on to the floor.<ref name=\"Allowances\">Nick Speed, \"A quick hit gives MEPs a fast buck\", ''Sunday Times'', 25 April 2004, p. 5.</ref> Adam denied the claim and attacked Martin's methods.<ref name=\"Denial\">Ross Smith, \"Euro MP silent on payment bust-up\", ''The Journal'', 26 April 2004, p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nAdam retired from the European Parliament at the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 election]]. He supported the move for an elected regional authority in the [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|devolution referendum]] later that year, recalling his first election in 1964 when he called for investment in the region's roads; Adam believed a regional authority would unlock investment held back by Whitehall.<ref name=\"Devolution\">Letters, ''The Journal'', 9 October 2004, p. 10.</ref> In 2006 he criticised the group of Labour MPs who had called for [[Tony Blair]] to resign the Labour Party leadership, warning that the electorate would not re-elect \"a squabbling, divided party\".<ref name=\"Divided party\">\"Voters will not re-elect a divided Labour Party\" (Letters), ''The Journal'', 12 September 2006, p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Adam was appointed to the Board of the South Tyneside Groundwork Trust.<ref name=\"Debrett\" /> He is also President of the [[Felling Male Voice Choir]].<ref name=\"Felling Choir\">Amy Hunt, \"All in fine voice\", ''Evening Chronicle'', 5 June 2007, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://archives.eui.eu/en/fonds/151826?item=GA A collection of archival documents] by A.
