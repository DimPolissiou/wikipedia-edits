{"title_page": "Sovereign default", "text_new": "{{Short description|when a country cannot pay its debts}}\n{{for|the South Korean film|Sovereign Default}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2018}}\n{{Insolvency}}\nA '''sovereign default''' is the failure or refusal of the [[government]] of a [[sovereign state]] to pay back [[Government debt|its debt]] in full. Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay (or only partially pay) its debts, or it may be unannounced. A [[credit rating agency]] will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural [[default (finance)|default]]s, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments.  Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through [[inflation]].  This is not \"default\" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value.  Sometimes governments [[Devaluation|devalue their currency]]. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates.  Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.\n\nIf potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in [[risk premium|compensation for the risk]] of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a '''[[debt crisis|sovereign debt crisis]]'''. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a situation of [[maturity mismatch]] between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base.\n\nThey may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to [[currency mismatch]]: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign-denominated bonds, decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back their foreign-denominated bonds (see [[Original Sin (economics)|original sin]]).<ref>{{cite book |first=B. |last=Eichengreen |authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first2=R. |last2=Hausmann |year=2005 |title=Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Economies |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-19455-8 }}</ref>\n\nSince a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt.<ref>{{cite web |first=E. |last=Borensztein |first2=U. |last2=Panizza  |url=http://vox.lacea.org/fckeditor.html?q=node/25 |title=The Costs of Sovereign Default: Theory and Reality |work=VOXLACEA |date=Nov 10, 2010 }}</ref> Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the [[UN Charter]] Article 2 (4) prohibiting [[use of force by states]], made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its [[creditor's rights]]. For example, in 1882, the United Kingdom [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|invaded Egypt]]. Other examples include the United States' \"[[gunboat diplomacy]]\" in Venezuela in the mid-1890s and the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] beginning in 1915.<ref name=\"This-time-is-different\">{{cite book |first=Carmen M. |last=Reinhart |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff |year=2009 |title=This time is different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (p. 54ff) |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-14216-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/thistimeisdiffer00rein_0 }}</ref>\n\nToday a government that defaults may be widely excluded from further credit, some of its overseas assets may be seized;<ref name=\"This-time-is-different\"/> and it may face political pressure from its own domestic bondholders to pay back its debt.

This budget balance/margin was covered through new indebtedness with national and foreign citizens, banks and states.\n\n===Illiquidity===\nThe literature proposes an important distinction between ''illiquidity'' and ''insolvency''. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is \"in default because of illiquidity\". In this concept the default can be solved as soon as the assets that are \"only temporarily illiquid\" become ''liquid'' (again), which makes illiquidity a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.\n\n===Change of government===\nWhile normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a [[regime change]] the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered [[odious debt]].\n\nImportant examples are:\n*default of debts of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] France after the [[French Revolution]].\n*default of bonds through [[Denmark]] in 1850, which were issued by the government of [[Holstein]] instated by the [[German Confederation]].\n*default of debts of the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government came to power in 1917.<ref>Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), \"Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)\", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535.</ref>\n*repudiation of debts of the [[Confederate States of America]] by the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of Section 4 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\n===Decline of the state===\nWith the decline of a state,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=how is this distinct from successor governments discussed above?}} its obligations are turned over to one or several [[succession of states|successor state]]s.\n\nLost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after [[World War II]] the [[government debt]] has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to [[compound interest]] and continued [[overspending]]<ref name=\"Baqir, Reza\"/> it has increased substantially.\n\n== Approaches to debt repayment ==\nThere are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.\n\n=== Reputation approach ===\nThe reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.<ref name=\"vox\">{{Cite journal|url=https://voxeu.org/article/why-sovereigns-repay-debts-external-creditors-and-why-it-matters|title=Why sovereigns repay debts to external creditors and why it matters|issue=2|pages=289\u2013309|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=48|jstor=2296886|last1=Eaton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Gersovitz|first2=Mark|year=1981|doi=10.2307/2296886}}</ref>\n\n=== Punishment approach ===\nThe punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency.<ref name=\"vox\" />\n\n==Consequences==\nCreditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default.\n\n===Consequences for creditors===\n\nThe immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country.\n\nIn this case very often there are international negotiations that end in a partial [[debt cancellation]] ([[London Agreement on German External Debts]] 1953) or [[debt restructuring]] (e.g. [[Brady Bonds]] in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]] some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or \"haircut\") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( \"holdouts\") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation.\n\nFor the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state.<ref name=theft/>\n\n===Consequences for the state===\nWhen a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market.<ref name=theft/> In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the [[Monetary Sovereignty|monetary sovereignty]] of the debtor state or even declare war (see above).\n\n===Consequences for the citizen===\nIf the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. [[government bonds]]), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth.\n\nIn addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default:\n* a [[banking crisis]], as banks have to make [[Writedowns|write downs]] on credits given to the state.\n* an [[economic crisis]], as the interior [[demand]] will fall and investors withdraw their money\n* a [[currency crisis]] as foreign investors avoid this national economy\n\nCitizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a [[Monetary sovereignty|monetarily sovereign]] state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's [[Plano Real]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazil-battle-against-inflation/ |title=Brazil's Battle Against Inflation |publisher=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Solutions==\nWith the reputation of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] &ndash; [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] and [[Fitch Group]] &ndash; coming under fire since the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2008 financial crisis]], many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at [http://www.publicsectorcredit.org/ Public Sector Credit Solutions] (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit [[Econometric model|econometric models]], are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/rating-government-bonds-can-we-raise-our-grade |title=Joffe, Marc. \"Rating Government Bonds: Can We Raise Our Grade?\" Econ Journal Watch 9(3): 350-365, September 2012 |publisher=Econjwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with [[Wikirating]]) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the [[Public Sector Credit Framework]], an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities.\n\n==Examples of sovereign default==\n{{main article|List of sovereign defaults}}\nA failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted on debt four times \u2013 in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596 \u2013 becoming the first nation in history to declare sovereign default due to rising military costs and the declining value of gold,  as it had become increasingly dependent on the revenues flowing in from its [[Spanish Empire|mercantile empire]] in the Americas.<ref>[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH8.html Gold and Silver: Spain and the New World] University of California</ref> This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fuggers]] as Spanish financiers. [[Republic of Genoa#Golden age of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures.\n\nIn the 1820s, several Latin American countries that had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.<ref name=\"jorgensen\">Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, \"Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period\" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=K42LgBw0zqMC The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective]''</ref>\n\nA failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s. As protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell, especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions. For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports; or, at least, its exports under then-current pricing. Whether reductions in prices \u2013 forced sales \u2013 would have enabled fulfilling [[creditors' rights]] is unknown.<ref name=\"jorgensen\" />\n\nMore recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund.

Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay (or only partially pay) its debts, or it may be unannounced. A [[credit rating agency]] will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural [[default (finance)|default]]s, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments.  Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through [[inflation]].  This is not \"default\" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value.  Sometimes governments [[Devaluation|devalue their currency]]. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates.  Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.\n\nIf potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in [[risk premium|compensation for the risk]] of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a '''[[debt crisis|sovereign debt crisis]]'''. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a situation of [[maturity mismatch]] between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base.\n\nThey may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to [[currency mismatch]]: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign-denominated bonds, decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back their foreign-denominated bonds (see [[Original Sin (economics)|original sin]]).<ref>{{cite book |first=B. |last=Eichengreen |authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first2=R. |last2=Hausmann |year=2005 |title=Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Economies |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-19455-8 }}</ref>\n\nSince a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt.<ref>{{cite web |first=E. |last=Borensztein |first2=U. |last2=Panizza  |url=http://vox.lacea.org/fckeditor.html?q=node/25 |title=The Costs of Sovereign Default: Theory and Reality |work=VOXLACEA |date=Nov 10, 2010 }}</ref> Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the [[UN Charter]] Article 2 (4) prohibiting [[use of force by states]], made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its [[creditor's rights]]. For example, in 1882, the United Kingdom [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|invaded Egypt]].

The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.\n\n===Change of government===\nWhile normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a [[regime change]] the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered [[odious debt]].\n\nImportant examples are:\n*default of debts of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] France after the [[French Revolution]].\n*default of bonds through [[Denmark]] in 1850, which were issued by the government of [[Holstein]] instated by the [[German Confederation]].\n*default of debts of the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government came to power in 1917.<ref>Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), \"Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)\", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535.</ref>\n*repudiation of debts of the [[Confederate States of America]] by the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of Section 4 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\n===Decline of the state===\nWith the decline of a state,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=how is this distinct from successor governments discussed above?}} its obligations are turned over to one or several [[succession of states|successor state]]s.\n\nLost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after [[World War II]] the [[government debt]] has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to [[compound interest]] and continued [[overspending]]<ref name=\"Baqir, Reza\"/> it has increased substantially.\n\n== Approaches to debt repayment ==\nThere are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.\n\n=== Reputation approach ===\nThe reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.<ref name=\"vox\">{{Cite journal|url=https://voxeu.org/article/why-sovereigns-repay-debts-external-creditors-and-why-it-matters|title=Why sovereigns repay debts to external creditors and why it matters|issue=2|pages=289\u2013309|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=48|jstor=2296886|last1=Eaton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Gersovitz|first2=Mark|year=1981|doi=10.2307/2296886}}</ref>\n\n=== Punishment approach ===\nThe punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency.<ref name=\"vox\" />\n\n==Consequences==\nCreditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default.\n\n===Consequences for creditors===\n\nThe immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country.\n\nIn this case very often there are international negotiations that end in a partial [[debt cancellation]] ([[London Agreement on German External Debts]] 1953) or [[debt restructuring]] (e.g. [[Brady Bonds]] in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]] some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or \"haircut\") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( \"holdouts\") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation.\n\nFor the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state.<ref name=theft/>\n\n===Consequences for the state===\nWhen a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market.<ref name=theft/> In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the [[Monetary Sovereignty|monetary sovereignty]] of the debtor state or even declare war (see above).\n\n===Consequences for the citizen===\nIf the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. [[government bonds]]), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth.\n\nIn addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default:\n* a [[banking crisis]], as banks have to make [[Writedowns|write downs]] on credits given to the state.\n* an [[economic crisis]], as the interior [[demand]] will fall and investors withdraw their money\n* a [[currency crisis]] as foreign investors avoid this national economy\n\nCitizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a [[Monetary sovereignty|monetarily sovereign]] state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's [[Plano Real]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazil-battle-against-inflation/ |title=Brazil's Battle Against Inflation |publisher=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Solutions==\nWith the reputation of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] &ndash; [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] and [[Fitch Group]] &ndash; coming under fire since the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2008 financial crisis]], many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at [http://www.publicsectorcredit.org/ Public Sector Credit Solutions] (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit [[Econometric model|econometric models]], are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/rating-government-bonds-can-we-raise-our-grade |title=Joffe, Marc. \"Rating Government Bonds: Can We Raise Our Grade?\" Econ Journal Watch 9(3): 350-365, September 2012 |publisher=Econjwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with [[Wikirating]]) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the [[Public Sector Credit Framework]], an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities.\n\n==Examples of sovereign default==\n{{main article|List of sovereign defaults}}\nA failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted on debt four times \u2013 in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596 \u2013 becoming the first nation in history to declare sovereign default due to rising military costs and the declining value of gold,  as it had become increasingly dependent on the revenues flowing in from its [[Spanish Empire|mercantile empire]] in the Americas.<ref>[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH8.html Gold and Silver: Spain and the New World] University of California</ref> This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fuggers]] as Spanish financiers. [[Republic of Genoa#Golden age of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures.\n\nIn the 1820s, several Latin American countries that had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.<ref name=\"jorgensen\">Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, \"Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period\" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=K42LgBw0zqMC The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective]''</ref>\n\nA failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s. As protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell, especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions. For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports; or, at least, its exports under then-current pricing. Whether reductions in prices \u2013 forced sales \u2013 would have enabled fulfilling [[creditors' rights]] is unknown.<ref name=\"jorgensen\" />\n\nMore recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund.

Rather than repel wandering scavengers, the chemical was proved to be toxic to the local rodent population for up to 4 years. Continued experiments conducted by the U.S. Forest Service found no direct effect between TETS and the gastro-intestinal or renal systems of spinal dogs. In this same study, no effects were seen within the peripheral or skeletal nerve system, limiting symptoms of toxicity to the brain stem. Curtis and Johnson were the first to hypothesize TETS antagonistic behavior on GABA. An in-vitro study using superior cervical ganglion neurons of rats found TETS to antagonize the depolarization actions of GABA, while having no influence on the cholinomimetic agent carbachol. This evidence suggests that TETS may act as a non-competitive inhibitor for GABA. Further research findings using crustacean models, indicated a dose-dependent, non-competitive response to TETS that is reversible.\n\n==Research==\n\n===In vitro and rapid screening tools=== \n\nRecent studies have indicated the usefulness of pH sensitivity in identifying Chloride ion influx, resulting from GABAA receptor excitation. Other potential screening tools include spontaneous Calcium ion oscillations seen in hippocampal cell cultures from new born mice. This phenomenon can be measured by Calcium ion sensitive fluorescent dye. Further analyses showed that these Calcium ion oscillations are sensitive to MK-801 (an NMDA open channel blocker), suggesting that NMDA receptor operated channels are involved in TMDT induced spontaneous activity. When considering GABAA receptor activity, diazepam and pregnanolone reversed TMDT activity when applied to cell cultures individually and in combination. MK-801 and ketamine show more antagonistic effects on TMDT than diazepam within cerebral cortical cell cultures of embryonic rats.  \n\n===In vivo mouse models=== \n\nLow dosages of ketamine and MK-801, administered separately, were associated with increased clonic seizures with no effect on tonic clonic seizures on mice exposed to TETS. Further analysis on the same sample of mice, found that dual administration of diazepine and MK-801 had a synergistic protective effect against tonic-clonic seizures and 24-hour lethality, as opposed to clonic seizures that were poorly controlled. Sequential administration diazepine and MK-801 for clonic control of seizures in TETS exposed mice, may indicate the benefits of benzodiazepine-NMDA receptor antagonist regimens used to treat TETS exposed patients.\n\n==Continued use in China==\nIts use worldwide has been banned since 1984, but due to continuing demand and its ease of production,<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Hecht, G. |author2=Henecka, H. | title = \u00dcber ein hochtoxisches Kondensationsprodukt von Sulfamid und Formaldehyd |trans-title=About a Highly Toxic Condensation Product of Sulfamide and Formaldehyde | language = German | journal = Angewandte Chemie | year = 1949 | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 365\u2013366 | doi = 10.1002/ange.19490610905 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite patent | inventor = Hecht, G.; Henecka, H.; Meisenheimer, M. | assign1 = Bayer Leverkusen, Germany | title = Rodenticidal compositions | country = US | status = patent | number = 2650186 | gdate = 1953-08-25 }}</ref> it is still readily, although illegally, available in China and can be found in some illegally imported rat poisons.

Additionally, the USSR took the decision to increase anti-Israeli sentiment by disseminating [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] propaganda and even referencing previous anti-Semitic tropes from Western culture, such as the Jewish-Freemason conspiracy theories<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spier|first=Howard|date=1979-01-01|title='Zionists and freemasons' in Soviet propaganda|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1979.9969479|issn=0031-322X}}</ref>. The overall goal of the campaign was to spread the idea that the state of Israel was an oppressive, imperialist state which was built on unjust terms, a feeling expressed in the Soviet-crafted [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379]]. Meanwhile, the cause of the Palestinian people who had suffered mass displacement and deportation with the establishment of the state of Israel and the subsequent wars in the region was promoted and the USSR gave active support to certain Palestinian rebel groups whose primary method of struggle is characterised as terrorism, such as the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO).\n\nLt.

Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption.  Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores.  However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts.  Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = E | last2 = Aub | first2 = JC | last3 = Albright | first3 = F | year = 1929 | title = Studies of calcium and phosphorus metabolism: V.

However, there is no evidence of fracture rate reduction in patients taking a teriparatide and denosumab combination. Moreover, the combination therapy group showed a significant decrease in their bone formation marker, indicating that denosumab, an antiresorptive agent, might actually counteract the effect of teriparatide, a bone formation anabolic agent, in bone formation. <ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60856-9|pmid=24517156|title=Teriparatide and denosumab, alone or combined, in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: The DATA study randomised trial|journal=The Lancet|volume=382|issue=9886|pages=1694\u20131700|year=2013|last1=Tsai|first1=Joy N|last2=Uihlein|first2=Alexander V|last3=Lee|first3=Hang|last4=Kumbhani|first4=Ruchit|last5=Siwila-Sackman|first5=Erica|last6=McKay|first6=Elizabeth A|last7=Burnett-Bowie|first7=Sherri-Ann M|last8=Neer|first8=Robert M|last9=Leder|first9=Benjamin Z|pmc=4010689}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abaloparatide]]\n* [[Osteolectin]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a603018.html Teriparatide at National Institutes of Health].\n*[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464171 When to Use Teriparatide -

Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption.  Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores.  However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts.  Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = E | last2 = Aub | first2 = JC | last3 = Albright | first3 = F | year = 1929 | title = Studies of calcium and phosphorus metabolism: V.

However, there is no evidence of fracture rate reduction in patients taking a teriparatide and denosumab combination. Moreover, the combination therapy group showed a significant decrease in their bone formation marker, indicating that denosumab, an antiresorptive agent, might actually counteract the effect of teriparatide, a bone formation anabolic agent, in bone formation. <ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60856-9|pmid=24517156|title=Teriparatide and denosumab, alone or combined, in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: The DATA study randomised trial|journal=The Lancet|volume=382|issue=9886|pages=1694\u20131700|year=2013|last1=Tsai|first1=Joy N|last2=Uihlein|first2=Alexander V|last3=Lee|first3=Hang|last4=Kumbhani|first4=Ruchit|last5=Siwila-Sackman|first5=Erica|last6=McKay|first6=Elizabeth A|last7=Burnett-Bowie|first7=Sherri-Ann M|last8=Neer|first8=Robert M|last9=Leder|first9=Benjamin Z|pmc=4010689}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abaloparatide]]\n* [[Osteolectin]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a603018.html Teriparatide at National Institutes of Health].\n*[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464171 When to Use Teriparatide - Medscape].\n\n{{Calcium homeostasis}}\n{{Signaling peptide/protein receptor modulators}}\n\n[[Category:Eli Lilly and Company brands]]\n[[Category:Osteoporosis drugs]]\n[[Category:Parathyroid hormone receptor agonists]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"}

It is the district capital and largest town in [[Hilir Perak]] district and third largest town in the state of [[Perak]] with an estimated population of around 120,000, about half of [[Hilir Perak]] district's total population (232,900).\n\nIn the early days, the town was known as '''Teluk Mak Intan''', after a female [[Mandailing]] trader. It was here that the Perak rulers held court from 1528 until [[Kuala Kangsar]] became the royal town in 1877.<ref>New Straits Times : [http://www.nst.com.my/Weekly/Travel/article/Heritage/20061109143923/Article/index_html Walking Through History]</ref>\n\nDuring the British protectorate era, the named was changed to '''Teluk Anson''' ('''Anson Bay'''), in honour of a British Officer and last [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of [[Penang]], Major-General Sir [[Edward Anson|Archibald Edward Harbord Anson]] who drew the plan of the modern township in 1882.\n\nIn 1982 during the centenary of the town's establishment, the name was changed again to Teluk Intan ('''Diamond Bay''') by the [[Sultan of Perak]].  [[Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan]] is one of the town attractions.  The town has a number of colonial buildings and Chinese shophouses together with modern buildings, few shopping complexes and a modern cinema.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town was founded on the river bank of the [[Perak River]]. The river forms an [[meander|oxbow meander]] as it flows through the town, and the town is built around the oxbow. During high-tides, some parts of the town will be flooded with water even though there are watergates and banks to protect the town. Various measures taken by the government to solve the problem have seen relatively few floods in Teluk Intan nowadays. There has been speculation that the river's flow will erode the narrow neck of land in between the loops of the meander effectively turning Teluk Intan into an island.\n\nThe town is on [[Malaysia Federal Route 58]] (Jalan Changkat Jong and Jalan Maharaja Lela), \n[[Jalan Sultan Abdullah, Teluk Intan|Perak State Route A151]] (Jalan Sultan Abdullah) and \n[[Jalan Padang Tembak|Perak State Route A147]] (Jalan Padang Tembak).\n\n==History==\nThe area around Teluk Intan was originally populated by refugees from the [[Malacca Sultanate]] who were part of the entourage of the [[Raja Muzaffar Shah]], the eldest son of the last Sultan of Melaka, [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]]. Upon fleeing the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511, a new kingdom was established on the banks of the [[Perak River]] near what is now Teluk Intan, and the court remained there until its relocation to [[Kuala Kangsar]] in the northern part of the state later in the 19th century.\n\nThis legacy can be seen in the choice of Teluk Intan as the location where the official residences of the [[Raja Muda]] (Crown Prince) and [[Raja di Hilir]] (4th in line of succession to the Perak throne) of Perak under the reign of [[Sultan Idris Shah]]. The town is one of four towns that play a role in Perak's complex ruler succession system. According to the system, a crown prince stayed at Teluk Intan Palace before entering the next stage of becoming Raja Bendahara (Prime Prince). Only after becoming Raja Bendahara will he proceed to be Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and then Sultan of Perak.\n\nThis succession system was changed by the former Sultan, Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah just before he was appointed the Yang Dipertuan Agong. His son was the then Raja Muda (now the Sultan of Perak) and did not live in Teluk Intan. The former palace is located just outside the town, and has fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe town of Teluk Intan developed around a few small villages in the location, such as Durian Sebatang, Pasir Bedamar, and Batak Rabit. A plan to build a township linking the few villages was drawn up by Sir Archibald Anson during the late 19th century, and the township was named after him in 1882. Teluk Intan developed into a port, and many agricultural products and tin were exported from it. The fourth railway track in Malaya was built connecting [[Tapah]] and Teluk Intan, showing the port town's importance during the British protectorate age.\n\nTeluk Intan was also home to the meeting between Raja Abdullah, Dato' Maharajalela and other Malay chieftains who plotted to kill [[J. W. W. Birch]], the first British Resident of Perak. The meeting was held in Durian Sebatang. Birch was later killed in [[Pasir Salak]] while bathing in the river.\n\nThe last major engagement during the [[Malayan Emergency]] was fought in the marshes near Teluk Intan in 1958, and ended with the surrender of the local [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] forces to government forces.\n\nBy the early 1980s the town was the third largest town in Perak. Teluk Intan served as the major administrative and business settlement for smaller neighbouring towns such as [[Tapah]], [[Bidor]], [[Bagan Datoh]] and [[Hutan Melintang]]. Until the mid-1990s [[Sabak Bernam]], a town in the neighbouring state of [[Selangor]], also dependeded on Teluk Intan for most of their basic services. Even their telephone area code was registered using Perak's area code of +605 instead of +603 that is used in Selangor. Acute medical cases would be transferred to [[Teluk Intan Hospital]] as their hospital did not have the equipment or expertise.\n\nAs the Perak River became shallower each year due to upstream erosion and silt deposition near Teluk Intan, the town lost its two most important roles in Perak's economy which was being an export [[harbour]] for tin and rubber and as a petroleum distribution centre for Shell Malaysia. This is because big oil tankers and cargo ships were no longer able to sail into the town's port. By the end of the 1980s, Shell Malaysia transferred their petroleum storing facilities to the coastal town of [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] in Manjung, located 60&nbsp;km from Teluk Intan. As the economic activity declined, it also lost its railway facilities which connected the town with Tapah and the national railway network.\n\nDuring the 1990s, economic activities in Teluk Intan continued to decline. This situation forced the younger generation to migrate to bigger cities such as [[Ipoh]], Kuala Lumpur, [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] and [[Shah Alam]] in search of better jobs. Ironically this caused the town to suffer a shortage in labour supply especially in the agriculture sector, resulting in an increase of migrant workers from [[Indonesia]] and [[Bangladesh]].\n\nWith the development of a new town centre along with the completion of new coastal highway from [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] to [[Sabak Bernam]] in late 1999, Teluk Intan began to enjoy a resurgence in its economic activity. In April 2004, the town was made the fourth municipality (having upgraded to Municipal Council status, or Majlis Perbandaran) in [[Perak]] after [[Ipoh]], [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and [[Manjung]].\n\n==Main economic activities==\n\nThe main economic activities in Teluk Intan are [[oil palm]] cultivation and [[palm oil]] production. Many plantations around Teluk Intan are owned by big corporations such as [[Sime Darby]] and United Plantations (UP).<ref>[http://www.unitedplantations.com United Plantations]</ref>\n\nThere are some other industries in Teluk Intan including [[shipbuilding]]<ref>[http://www.sumbersamudra.com.my/About%20Us.html Sumber Samudera Sdn Bhd]</ref> and the [[textile industry]]. Shopping centres, modern cinema, shops, and educational institutions also bring many people to Teluk Intan weekly.\n\n==Shopping==\n\nAs it is the major town in Hilir Perak, Teluk Intan's shopping centres attract shoppers from nearby smaller townships and the surrounding area. They include:\n\n*Kompleks Aik Aik, Jalan Mahkota\n*Kompleks Menara Condong, Jalan Ah Cheong\n*The Store, Jalan Ah Cheong\n*TF Value Mart, Jalan Maharajalela\n*TF Value Mart, Jalan Sungai Manik\n\n==Healthcare==\nThe main healthcare centres in Teluk Intan town are:\n*[[Teluk Intan Hospital]] (providing secondary health care service)\n*Pusat Pakar Rajindar Singh<ref>[http://www.hospitals-malaysia.org/portal/index.asp?menuid=3 Private hospitals by state]; [http://www.hospitals-malaysia.org/portal/hospital.asp?action=view&hospitalid=103 Pusat Pakar Rajindar Singh]</ref>\n*Teluk Intan General Clinic\n*Anson Bay Medical Centre<ref>[http://www.abmc.com.my/ Anson Bay Medical Centre (ABMC)]</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\n\n===Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan===\n{{main|Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan}}\nOne of the town attractions is a [[Leaning Tower]] erected in 1885 by a Chinese builder, Mr. Leong Choon Cheong. It started to tilt four years after its construction finished due to an underground stream. The tower was originally used as a [[water tower]] supplying the area of the town. It had a clock at the top, which still rings every 15 minutes. The tower also served as a beacon to guide ships into Teluk Intan Port. The tower came close to being demolished when a decision by the then Lower Perak Sanitary Board passed a resolution to have it demolished in July 1941<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19410812-1.2.24?ST=1&AT=search&k=Teluk%20Anson%20Leaning%20tower&QT=teluk,anson,leaning,tower&oref=article|title=Malaya's Leaning Tower Doomed|last=Malaya|first=Tribune Reporter|date=12 August 1941|work=Malaya Tribune|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref> due to the impending air raids.

The main street at the centre of Teluk Intan, Jalan Ah Cheong, is named after Leong Choon Cheong to commemorate his contribution.\n\nGPS Coordinates: 4\u00b01.544\u2032N, 101\u00b01.133\u2032E\n\n[[File:Batu Tenggek war memorial, Teluk Intan, Malaysia.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Memorial Stone]]\n\n===Batu Tenggek (War Memorial)===\nAnother attraction is the 'Batu Tenggek' (Sitting Boulder) which is situated at a junction in the town centre. There is a local legend that the rock was placed there by a British soldier, and was originally the size of a matchbox but grew bigger over the years however this is not the truth. The boulder was placed in the compound of the Lower Perak Club in an angle formed by Dew Road and Batak Rabit Road, and the giant granite boulder was placed on a dressed based made of solid stone. The memorial commemorating the fallen of [[World War I|World war I]] & [[World War II|II]] was officiated by Sir Theodore Fraser, General Commanding Officer of the Malaya Command of the British empire during his tenure between 1924 and 1927.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19260120-1.2.38|title=War Memorial|last=|first=|date=20 January 1926|work=The Straits Times|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> Carved on the dressed stone is a line taken from  [[Laurence Binyon]]'s famous poem, \"[[For the Fallen]]\": \n\n:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning''\n:''We will remember them''\n:::''1914\u20131918''\n\n===The Ruin of Raja Muda's Palace===\n\nThis palace was once the official residence of The [[Crown Prince|Raja Muda]] of Perak. After the demise of the Raja Muda, the palace was neglected, and drug addicts used and stripped the building. Some people believe the remains of the palace to be haunted. It is illegal to enter the grounds without permission, because it is the property of the [[Sultan of Perak]]. The ruin is located next to the mansion of Dato. Mah, near Jalan Sekolah.\n\n===Hock Soon Temple===\nThere is also a famous temple complex in Teluk Intan, known as Hock Soon Keong (Hock Soon Temple) dedicated to Seng Gong. The origins of the temple are unknown, while the main temple building (not the original one) was constructed in 1883, as indicated by a legend painted on the building. Hock Soon Temple was the centrepoint of all [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] Chinese in Teluk Intan during the British colonial era. The local Hokkien people would congregate at the temple to solve all problems, from giving aid to the poor to solving fights between clans. The local Hokkien people used to select three local Hokkiens, usually businessmen and famous men to settle their problems. The temple was built with Southern Chinese architecture, the most notable feature being the elaborately decorated upturned eaves. There is also a century old mosque just opposite the temple, which is frequently mentioned as a typical depiction of religious harmony in Malaysia.\n\n===Sri Subramaniam Temple===\nThe temple is popularly called 'Perak Thendayuthapani Temple', and also as Malaysia's Palani Andavar. Construction of the temple began in 1926. Financial support was provided by the Nattukottai [[Chettiar]]s (also known as the [[Nagarathar]]s), a prominent mercantile community with origins in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.\n\nThe most prominent festival held at this temple is the Chitra Pournami during the Tamil month of Chithrai (April\u2013May). The Chitra Pournami festival lasts three days. On the third day of the festival (the day of Pournami, full moon), the Silver Chariot (Velli Ratham) is taken in procession. This velli ratham was brought to the temple in the year 1932. The procession's route usually covers the entire old town of Teluk Intan.\n\nThe temple is managed by the Nagarathars of seven towns including Teluk Intan, [[Tapah]], [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]], [[Bidor]], [[Sitiawan]]Pantai remis and [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]. Now there is no representation from Bidor and Pantai remis. They make donations annually at festival time. The day-to-day management of the temple is entrusted to three Nagarathar families, who hold office in 57, 59 and 61, Jalan Bandar.\n\nThis temple is one of eighteen constructed by the Nattukottai Chettiars in Malaysia.\n\n===Sungai Kerawai Halt & Train Derailment by Elephant Bull===\nAlthough Sungai Kerawai Halt was one of the stops before the town of Teluk Anson, it was also here at this stop that the first railway crash of Malaya happened. While the much documented train derailment happened in 1894<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orangperak.com/peristiwa-serangan-gajah-di-teluk-intan-perak-pada-1894.html|title=Peristiwa Serangan Gajah Di Teluk Intan, Perak Pada 1894|last=Jasbindar|first=Freddie Aziz|website=www.orangperak.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> along the Tapah Teluk Anson Railway line.

These include '[[mee rebus]]' Mastan Ghani, a boiled noodle dish served with a moderately spicy and sweet gravy; a more spicy noodle dish called Mee Jawa; [[nasi kandar]], [[satay]], and fruit [[rojak]].\n\nAnother attraction is a beverage made of rose syrup mixed with coconut milk or milk called 'Ais Bandung'. This beverage can be found near the wet market, located on the northern riverbank.\n\nThe local Chinese community has a number of delicacies as well. One of them is '[[Heong Peah]]' (''Fragrant Biscuit''). Heong Peah has a crispy pastry layer outside and a sticky filling inside (also known as beleko). It contains a mixture of flour, oil, maltose, sugar, sesame, and shallots. The 'Heong Peah' market in Teluk Intan is dominated by two family-run enterprises: Sin Guan Tin and Sin Joo Heong. Locals fondly refer to the latter as the 'Tiger' brand or mark or 'Tiger Biscuit'. The former's trademark is a butterfly.\n\nAnother delicacy in Teluk Intan is the '[[Chee Cheong Fun]]', a variation of [[Kueh Teow]] containing turnip, whereas the Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun has prawns wrapped inside.\n\nChinese curry mee and a variety of other food can be found at \"Glutton Square\" located at the corner of Jalan Sithabaram Pillai and Jalan Ah Cheong.\nThere is also a food court (locals call it \"Bumbung Biru\") in front of Menara Jam Condong \"The Leaning Tower\".\n\nAnother long-standing tourist sight for more than 25 years is Teluk Intan's [[laksa]] sold from a bicycle by \"Uncle Laksa\". This man rides around the town areas such as Jln Woo Saik Hong, Jln Pasir Bedamar, Jln Ah Cheong and Jln Pasar to sell his trademark laksa, cooked on his custom-made 3-wheeler bicycle.\nOther types of foods found in Teluk Intan include western-style [[fast food restaurant]]s and Japanese [[sushi]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n* [[Antony Selvanayagam]], Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Penang]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Navaratnam|first=Alan|authorlink=|title=Bishop Anthony Selvanayagam|work=Sillali Web Server|publisher=|url=|format=|doi=}}</ref>\n* [[Jamal Abdillah]], pop singer and actor\n* [[Joe Flizzow]], [[hip-hop]] artiste from the group [[Too Phat]]\n* [[Lau Wai Fong]], artist<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pal|first=Vivienne|title=A tale of great opportunities|newspaper=The Star|location=Malaysia|pages=|publisher=The Star Publications (M) Sdn.

It is the district capital and largest town in [[Hilir Perak]] district and third largest town in the state of [[Perak]] with an estimated population of around 120,000, about half of [[Hilir Perak]] district's total population (232,900).\n\nIn the early days, the town was known as '''Teluk Mak Intan''', after a female [[Mandailing]] trader. It was here that the Perak rulers held court from 1528 until [[Kuala Kangsar]] became the royal town in 1877.<ref>New Straits Times : [http://www.nst.com.my/Weekly/Travel/article/Heritage/20061109143923/Article/index_html Walking Through History]</ref>\n\nDuring the British protectorate era, the named was changed to '''Teluk Anson''' ('''Anson Bay'''), in honour of a British Officer and last [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of [[Penang]], Major-General Sir [[Edward Anson|Archibald Edward Harbord Anson]] who drew the plan of the modern township in 1882.\n\nIn 1982 during the centenary of the town's establishment, the name was changed again to Teluk Intan ('''Diamond Bay''') by the [[Sultan of Perak]].  [[Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan]] is one of the town attractions.  The town has a number of colonial buildings and Chinese shophouses together with modern buildings, few shopping complexes and a modern cinema.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town was founded on the river bank of the [[Perak River]]. The river forms an [[meander|oxbow meander]] as it flows through the town, and the town is built around the oxbow. During high-tides, some parts of the town will be flooded with water even though there are watergates and banks to protect the town. Various measures taken by the government to solve the problem have seen relatively few floods in Teluk Intan nowadays. There has been speculation that the river's flow will erode the narrow neck of land in between the loops of the meander effectively turning Teluk Intan into an island.\n\nThe town is on [[Malaysia Federal Route 58]] (Jalan Changkat Jong and Jalan Maharaja Lela), \n[[Jalan Sultan Abdullah, Teluk Intan|Perak State Route A151]] (Jalan Sultan Abdullah) and \n[[Jalan Padang Tembak|Perak State Route A147]] (Jalan Padang Tembak).\n\n==History==\nThe area around Teluk Intan was originally populated by refugees from the [[Malacca Sultanate]] who were part of the entourage of the [[Raja Muzaffar Shah]], the eldest son of the last Sultan of Melaka, [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]]. Upon fleeing the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511, a new kingdom was established on the banks of the [[Perak River]] near what is now Teluk Intan, and the court remained there until its relocation to [[Kuala Kangsar]] in the northern part of the state later in the 19th century.\n\nThis legacy can be seen in the choice of Teluk Intan as the location where the official residences of the [[Raja Muda]] (Crown Prince) and [[Raja di Hilir]] (4th in line of succession to the Perak throne) of Perak under the reign of [[Sultan Idris Shah]]. The town is one of four towns that play a role in Perak's complex ruler succession system. According to the system, a crown prince stayed at Teluk Intan Palace before entering the next stage of becoming Raja Bendahara (Prime Prince). Only after becoming Raja Bendahara will he proceed to be Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and then Sultan of Perak.\n\nThis succession system was changed by the former Sultan, Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah just before he was appointed the Yang Dipertuan Agong. His son was the then Raja Muda (now the Sultan of Perak) and did not live in Teluk Intan. The former palace is located just outside the town, and has fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe town of Teluk Intan developed around a few small villages in the location, such as Durian Sebatang, Pasir Bedamar, and Batak Rabit. A plan to build a township linking the few villages was drawn up by Sir Archibald Anson during the late 19th century, and the township was named after him in 1882. Teluk Intan developed into a port, and many agricultural products and tin were exported from it. The fourth railway track in Malaya was built connecting [[Tapah]] and Teluk Intan, showing the port town's importance during the British protectorate age.\n\nTeluk Intan was also home to the meeting between Raja Abdullah, Dato' Maharajalela and other Malay chieftains who plotted to kill [[J. W. W. Birch]], the first British Resident of Perak. The meeting was held in Durian Sebatang. Birch was later killed in [[Pasir Salak]] while bathing in the river.\n\nThe last major engagement during the [[Malayan Emergency]] was fought in the marshes near Teluk Intan in 1958, and ended with the surrender of the local [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] forces to government forces.\n\nBy the early 1980s the town was the third largest town in Perak. Teluk Intan served as the major administrative and business settlement for smaller neighbouring towns such as [[Tapah]], [[Bidor]], [[Bagan Datoh]] and [[Hutan Melintang]]. Until the mid-1990s [[Sabak Bernam]], a town in the neighbouring state of [[Selangor]], also dependeded on Teluk Intan for most of their basic services. Even their telephone area code was registered using Perak's area code of +605 instead of +603 that is used in Selangor. Acute medical cases would be transferred to [[Teluk Intan Hospital]] as their hospital did not have the equipment or expertise.\n\nAs the Perak River became shallower each year due to upstream erosion and silt deposition near Teluk Intan, the town lost its two most important roles in Perak's economy which was being an export [[harbour]] for tin and rubber and as a petroleum distribution centre for Shell Malaysia. This is because big oil tankers and cargo ships were no longer able to sail into the town's port. By the end of the 1980s, Shell Malaysia transferred their petroleum storing facilities to the coastal town of [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] in Manjung, located 60&nbsp;km from Teluk Intan. As the economic activity declined, it also lost its railway facilities which connected the town with Tapah and the national railway network.\n\nDuring the 1990s, economic activities in Teluk Intan continued to decline. This situation forced the younger generation to migrate to bigger cities such as [[Ipoh]], Kuala Lumpur, [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] and [[Shah Alam]] in search of better jobs. Ironically this caused the town to suffer a shortage in labour supply especially in the agriculture sector, resulting in an increase of migrant workers from [[Indonesia]] and [[Bangladesh]].\n\nWith the development of a new town centre along with the completion of new coastal highway from [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] to [[Sabak Bernam]] in late 1999, Teluk Intan began to enjoy a resurgence in its economic activity. In April 2004, the town was made the fourth municipality (having upgraded to Municipal Council status, or Majlis Perbandaran) in [[Perak]] after [[Ipoh]], [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and [[Manjung]].\n\n==Main economic activities==\n\nThe main economic activities in Teluk Intan are [[oil palm]] cultivation and [[palm oil]] production.

It started to tilt four years after its construction finished due to an underground stream. The tower was originally used as a [[water tower]] supplying the area of the town. It had a clock at the top, which still rings every 15 minutes. The tower also served as a beacon to guide ships into Teluk Intan Port. The tower came close to being demolished when a decision by the then Lower Perak Sanitary Board passed a resolution to have it demolished in July 1941<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19410812-1.2.24?ST=1&AT=search&k=Teluk%20Anson%20Leaning%20tower&QT=teluk,anson,leaning,tower&oref=article|title=Malaya's Leaning Tower Doomed|last=Malaya|first=Tribune Reporter|date=12 August 1941|work=Malaya Tribune|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref> due to the impending air raids. However, another board meeting in September of 1941 reversed that decision and the tower remains standing<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19410924-1.2.63?ST=1&AT=search&k=Teluk%20Anson%20Leaning%20tower&QT=teluk,anson,leaning,tower&oref=article|title=Leaning Tower Gets Reprieve|last=Own|first=Reporter|date=24 September 1941|work=Malaya Tribune|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>. Currently it is a local tourist attraction, and no longer stores water. The tower is also recognised as a National Heritage through joint efforts by the National Heritage Department, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Perak State government and Teluk Intan Municipal Council.<ref>https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/02/28/teluk-intan-national-heritage/</ref> The area around the tower was paved with bricks and became a plaza. The main street at the centre of Teluk Intan, Jalan Ah Cheong, is named after Leong Choon Cheong to commemorate his contribution.\n\nGPS Coordinates: 4\u00b01.544\u2032N, 101\u00b01.133\u2032E\n\n[[File:Batu Tenggek war memorial, Teluk Intan, Malaysia.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Memorial Stone]]\n\n===Batu Tenggek (War Memorial)===\nAnother attraction is the 'Batu Tenggek' (Sitting Boulder) which is situated at a junction in the town centre. There is a local legend that the rock was placed there by a British soldier, and was originally the size of a matchbox but grew bigger over the years however this is not the truth. The boulder was placed in the compound of the Lower Perak Club in an angle formed by Dew Road and Batak Rabit Road, and the giant granite boulder was placed on a dressed based made of solid stone. The memorial commemorating the fallen of [[World War I|World war I]] & [[World War II|II]] was officiated by Sir Theodore Fraser, General Commanding Officer of the Malaya Command of the British empire during his tenure between 1924 and 1927.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19260120-1.2.38|title=War Memorial|last=|first=|date=20 January 1926|work=The Straits Times|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> Carved on the dressed stone is a line taken from  [[Laurence Binyon]]'s famous poem, \"[[For the Fallen]]\": \n\n:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning''\n:''We will remember them''\n:::''1914\u20131918''\n\n===The Ruin of Raja Muda's Palace===\n\nThis palace was once the official residence of The [[Crown Prince|Raja Muda]] of Perak. After the demise of the Raja Muda, the palace was neglected, and drug addicts used and stripped the building. Some people believe the remains of the palace to be haunted. It is illegal to enter the grounds without permission, because it is the property of the [[Sultan of Perak]]. The ruin is located next to the mansion of Dato. Mah, near Jalan Sekolah.\n\n===Hock Soon Temple===\nThere is also a famous temple complex in Teluk Intan, known as Hock Soon Keong (Hock Soon Temple) dedicated to Seng Gong. The origins of the temple are unknown, while the main temple building (not the original one) was constructed in 1883, as indicated by a legend painted on the building. Hock Soon Temple was the centrepoint of all [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] Chinese in Teluk Intan during the British colonial era. The local Hokkien people would congregate at the temple to solve all problems, from giving aid to the poor to solving fights between clans. The local Hokkien people used to select three local Hokkiens, usually businessmen and famous men to settle their problems. The temple was built with Southern Chinese architecture, the most notable feature being the elaborately decorated upturned eaves. There is also a century old mosque just opposite the temple, which is frequently mentioned as a typical depiction of religious harmony in Malaysia.\n\n===Sri Subramaniam Temple===\nThe temple is popularly called 'Perak Thendayuthapani Temple', and also as Malaysia's Palani Andavar. Construction of the temple began in 1926. Financial support was provided by the Nattukottai [[Chettiar]]s (also known as the [[Nagarathar]]s), a prominent mercantile community with origins in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.\n\nThe most prominent festival held at this temple is the Chitra Pournami during the Tamil month of Chithrai (April\u2013May). The Chitra Pournami festival lasts three days. On the third day of the festival (the day of Pournami, full moon), the Silver Chariot (Velli Ratham) is taken in procession. This velli ratham was brought to the temple in the year 1932. The procession's route usually covers the entire old town of Teluk Intan.\n\nThe temple is managed by the Nagarathars of seven towns including Teluk Intan, [[Tapah]], [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]], [[Bidor]], [[Sitiawan]]Pantai remis and [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]. Now there is no representation from Bidor and Pantai remis. They make donations annually at festival time. The day-to-day management of the temple is entrusted to three Nagarathar families, who hold office in 57, 59 and 61, Jalan Bandar.\n\nThis temple is one of eighteen constructed by the Nattukottai Chettiars in Malaysia.\n\n===Sungai Kerawai Halt & Train Derailment by Elephant Bull===\nAlthough Sungai Kerawai Halt was one of the stops before the town of Teluk Anson, it was also here at this stop that the first railway crash of Malaya happened. While the much documented train derailment happened in 1894<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orangperak.com/peristiwa-serangan-gajah-di-teluk-intan-perak-pada-1894.html|title=Peristiwa Serangan Gajah Di Teluk Intan, Perak Pada 1894|last=Jasbindar|first=Freddie Aziz|website=www.orangperak.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> along the Tapah Teluk Anson Railway line.
