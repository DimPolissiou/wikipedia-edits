It is one of two members of the family [[Monodontidae]], along with the [[narwhal]], and the only member of the [[genus]] ''Delphinapterus''. It is also known as the '''white whale''', as it is the only cetacean of this colour; the '''sea canary''', due to its high-pitched calls; and the '''melonhead''', though that more commonly refers to the [[melon-headed whale]], which is an [[oceanic dolphin]].\n\nThe beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic, so it has anatomical and physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans. Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a [[dorsal fin]], which allows them to swim under ice with ease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55466-beluga-whales.html|title=Facts About Beluga Whales|last=Bradford|first=Alina|last2=July 19|first2=Live Science Contributor {{!}}|website=Live Science|access-date=2019-06-12|last3=ET|first3=2016 08:45pm}}</ref> It possesses a distinctive protuberance at the front of its head which houses an [[animal echolocation|echolocation organ]] called the [[Melon (whale)|melon]], which in this species is large and deformable. The beluga's body size is between that of a dolphin and a true whale, with males growing up to {{convert|5.5|m|abbr=on}} long and weighing up to {{convert|1600|kg|-1|abbr=on}}. This whale has a stocky body. Like many cetaceans, a large percentage of its weight is [[blubber]] (subcutaneous fat). Its sense of hearing is highly developed and its [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] allows it to move about and find breathing holes under sheet ice.\n\nBelugas are [[gregarious]] and form groups of 10 animals on average, although during the summer, they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in [[Estuary|estuaries]] and shallow coastal areas. They are slow swimmers, but can dive to {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}} below the surface. They are [[List of feeding behaviours|opportunistic feeders]] and their diets vary according to their locations and the season. The majority of belugas live in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the seas and coasts around North America, Russia and Greenland; their worldwide population is thought to number around 150,000. They are [[Animal migration|migratory]] and the majority of groups spend the winter around the [[Arctic ice cap]]; when the [[sea ice]] melts in summer, they move to warmer river estuaries and coastal areas. Some populations are sedentary and do not migrate over great distances during the year.\n\nThe native peoples of North America and Russia have hunted belugas for many centuries. They were also hunted by non-natives during the 19th century and part of the 20th century. Hunting of belugas is not controlled by the [[International Whaling Commission]], and each country has developed its own regulations in different years. Currently some [[Inuit]] in Canada and Greenland, [[Alaska Native]] groups and Russians are allowed to hunt belugas to consume and sell; [[aboriginal whaling]] is excluded from the [[International Whaling Commission]] 1986 moratorium on hunting. The numbers have dropped substantially in Russia and Greenland, but not in Alaska and Canada. Other threats include natural predators ([[polar bear]]s and [[killer whale]]s), contamination of rivers (as with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCBs) which [[bioaccumulate]] up the food chain) and [[infectious disease]]s. The beluga was placed on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] in 2008 as being \"near threatened\"; the subpopulation from the [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska, however, is considered [[critically endangered]] and is under the protection of the United States' [[Endangered Species Act]]. Of seven Canadian beluga populations, those inhabiting eastern [[Hudson Bay]], [[Ungava Bay]] and the St. Lawrence River are listed as endangered.\n\nBelugas are one of the most commonly kept cetaceans in captivity and are housed in aquariums, [[dolphinarium]]s and wildlife parks in North America, Europe and Asia. They are popular with the public due to their colour and expression.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Narwhal x Beluga.jpg|thumb|upright|Skull of a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale, at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen]]\nThe beluga was first described in 1776 by [[Peter Simon Pallas]].<ref name=msw3 /> It is a member of the [[Monodontidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], which is in turn part of the [[parvorder]] [[Odontoceti]] (toothed whales).<ref name=msw3 /> The [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] was once placed in the same family, though recent genetic evidence suggests these dolphins belong to the family [[Dolphin|Delphinidae]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Arnold |first=P. |chapter=Irrawaddy Dolphin ''Orcaella brevirostris'' |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=652}}|page=652|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gr\u00e9tarsd\u00f3ttir, S. |author2=\u00c1rnason, \u00da. |title=Evolution of the common cetacean highly repetitive DNA component and the systematic position of ''Orcaella brevirostris'' |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=34 |pages=201\u2013208 |doi=10.1007/BF00162969 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pmid=1588595 |bibcode=1992JMolE..34..201G}}</ref> The [[narwhal]] is the only other species within the Monodontidae besides the beluga.<ref name=encyc>{{cite encyclopedia |last=O'Corry-Crowe |first=G. |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=94}}|title=Beluga Whale ''Delphinapterus leucas''|pages=94\u201399 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals}}</ref> A skull has been discovered with intermediate characteristics supporting the hypothesis that [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] is possible between these two families.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1993.tb00454.x |title=Description of an Anomalous Monodontid Skull from West Greenland: A Possible Hybrid? |year=1993 |last1=Heide-J\u00f8rgensen |first1=Mads P. |last2=Reeves |first2=Randall R. |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=258\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the [[genus]], ''Delphinapterus'', means \"dolphin without fin\" (from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd (''delphin''), dolphin and \u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''apteros''), without fin) and the species name ''leucas'' means \"white\" (from the Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (''leukas''), white).<ref name=Leatherwood>{{cite book |last1=Leatherwood |first1=Stephen |last2=Reeves |first2=Randall R. |title=The Sierra Club Handbook of Whales and Dolphins |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Kx4XAQAAIAAJ |page=320}}|year=1983|publisher=Sierra Club Books|isbn=978-0-87156-340-8|page=320}}</ref> The [[Red List of Threatened Species]] gives both beluga and white whale as common names, though the former is now more popular.

It is one of two members of the family [[Monodontidae]], along with the [[narwhal]], and the only member of the [[genus]] ''Delphinapterus''. It is also known as the '''white whale''', as it is the only cetacean of this colour; the '''sea canary''', due to its high-pitched calls; and the '''melonhead''', though that more commonly refers to the [[melon-headed whale]], which is an [[oceanic dolphin]].\n\nThe beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic, so it has anatomical and physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans. Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a [[dorsal fin]], which allows them to swim under ice with ease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55466-beluga-whales.html|title=Facts About Beluga Whales|last=Bradford|first=Alina|last2=July 19|first2=Live Science Contributor {{!}}|website=Live Science|access-date=2019-06-12|last3=ET|first3=2016 08:45pm}}</ref> It possesses a distinctive protuberance at the front of its head which houses an [[animal echolocation|echolocation organ]] called the [[Melon (whale)|melon]], which in this species is large and deformable. The beluga's body size is between that of a dolphin and a true whale, with males growing up to {{convert|5.5|m|abbr=on}} long and weighing up to {{convert|1600|kg|-1|abbr=on}}. This whale has a stocky body. Like many cetaceans, a large percentage of its weight is [[blubber]] (subcutaneous fat). Its sense of hearing is highly developed and its [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] allows it to move about and find breathing holes under sheet ice.\n\nBelugas are [[gregarious]] and form groups of 10 animals on average, although during the summer, they can gather in the hundreds or even thousands in [[Estuary|estuaries]] and shallow coastal areas. They are slow swimmers, but can dive to {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}} below the surface. They are [[List of feeding behaviours|opportunistic feeders]] and their diets vary according to their locations and the season. The majority of belugas live in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the seas and coasts around North America, Russia and Greenland; their worldwide population is thought to number around 150,000. They are [[Animal migration|migratory]] and the majority of groups spend the winter around the [[Arctic ice cap]]; when the [[sea ice]] melts in summer, they move to warmer river estuaries and coastal areas. Some populations are sedentary and do not migrate over great distances during the year.\n\nThe native peoples of North America and Russia have hunted belugas for many centuries. They were also hunted by non-natives during the 19th century and part of the 20th century. Hunting of belugas is not controlled by the [[International Whaling Commission]], and each country has developed its own regulations in different years. Currently some [[Inuit]] in Canada and Greenland, [[Alaska Native]] groups and Russians are allowed to hunt belugas to consume and sell; [[aboriginal whaling]] is excluded from the [[International Whaling Commission]] 1986 moratorium on hunting. The numbers have dropped substantially in Russia and Greenland, but not in Alaska and Canada. Other threats include natural predators ([[polar bear]]s and [[killer whale]]s), contamination of rivers (as with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCBs) which [[bioaccumulate]] up the food chain) and [[infectious disease]]s. The beluga was placed on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] in 2008 as being \"near threatened\"; the subpopulation from the [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska, however, is considered [[critically endangered]] and is under the protection of the United States' [[Endangered Species Act]]. Of seven Canadian beluga populations, those inhabiting eastern [[Hudson Bay]], [[Ungava Bay]] and the St. Lawrence River are listed as endangered.\n\nBelugas are one of the most commonly kept cetaceans in captivity and are housed in aquariums, [[dolphinarium]]s and wildlife parks in North America, Europe and Asia. They are popular with the public due to their colour and expression.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Narwhal x Beluga.jpg|thumb|upright|Skull of a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale, at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen]]\nThe beluga was first described in 1776 by [[Peter Simon Pallas]].<ref name=msw3 /> It is a member of the [[Monodontidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], which is in turn part of the [[parvorder]] [[Odontoceti]] (toothed whales).<ref name=msw3 /> The [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] was once placed in the same family, though recent genetic evidence suggests these dolphins belong to the family [[Dolphin|Delphinidae]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Arnold |first=P. |chapter=Irrawaddy Dolphin ''Orcaella brevirostris'' |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=652}}|page=652|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gr\u00e9tarsd\u00f3ttir, S. |author2=\u00c1rnason, \u00da. |title=Evolution of the common cetacean highly repetitive DNA component and the systematic position of ''Orcaella brevirostris'' |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=34 |pages=201\u2013208 |doi=10.1007/BF00162969 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pmid=1588595 |bibcode=1992JMolE..34..201G}}</ref> The [[narwhal]] is the only other species within the Monodontidae besides the beluga.<ref name=encyc>{{cite encyclopedia |last=O'Corry-Crowe |first=G. |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=94}}|title=Beluga Whale ''Delphinapterus leucas''|pages=94\u201399 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals}}</ref> A skull has been discovered with intermediate characteristics supporting the hypothesis that [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] is possible between these two families.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1993.tb00454.x |title=Description of an Anomalous Monodontid Skull from West Greenland: A Possible Hybrid? |year=1993 |last1=Heide-J\u00f8rgensen |first1=Mads P. |last2=Reeves |first2=Randall R. |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=258\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the [[genus]], ''Delphinapterus'', means \"dolphin without fin\" (from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd (''delphin''), dolphin and \u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''apteros''), without fin) and the species name ''leucas'' means \"white\" (from the Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 (''leukas''), white).<ref name=Leatherwood>{{cite book |last1=Leatherwood |first1=Stephen |last2=Reeves |first2=Randall R. |title=The Sierra Club Handbook of Whales and Dolphins |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Kx4XAQAAIAAJ |page=320}}|year=1983|publisher=Sierra Club Books|isbn=978-0-87156-340-8|page=320}}</ref> The [[Red List of Threatened Species]] gives both beluga and white whale as common names, though the former is now more popular.

The sound waves reflect from objects and return as echoes that are heard and interpreted by the animal.<ref name=seaworldcom /> This enables them to determine the distance, speed, size, shape and the object's internal structure within the beam of sound. They use this ability when moving around thick Arctic ice sheets, to find areas of unfrozen water for breathing, or air pockets trapped under the ice.<ref name=Katona />\n\nSome evidence indicates that belugas are highly sensitive to noise produced by humans. In one study, the maximum frequencies produced by an individual located in [[San Diego Bay]], [[California]], were between 40 and 60&nbsp;kHz. The same individual produced sounds with a maximum frequency of 100 to 120&nbsp;kHz when transferred to [[Kaneohe Bay]] in [[Hawaii]]. The difference in frequencies is thought to be a response to the difference in environmental noise in the two areas.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.392341 |pmid=3973242 |title=Demonstration of adaptation in beluga whale echolocation signals |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=726\u201330 |year=1985 |last1=Au |first1=W.

The groups near to or under the sea ice have a degree of protection, as the killer whale's large dorsal fin, up to 2&nbsp;m in length, impedes their movement under the ice and does not allow them to get sufficiently close to the breathing holes in the ice.<ref name=paine /> Beluga whale behavior under killer whale predation makes them vulnerable to hunters. When killer whales are present, large numbers of beluga whales congregate in the shallows for protection, which allows them to be hunted in droves.\n\n=== Contamination ===\n[[File:Beluga premier.gov.ru-8.jpeg|thumb|right|Russian scientists working on the White Whale Program place transmitters onto whales in Sea of Okhotsk]]\nThe beluga is considered an excellent sentinel species (indicator of environment health and changes), because it is long-lived, at the top of the food web, bears large amounts of fat and blubber, relatively well-studied for a cetacean, and still somewhat common.\n\nHuman pollution can be a threat to belugas' health when they congregate in river estuaries.

The [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2.  Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 ([[Constitutive enzyme|constitutive]]) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 ([[Adaptive enzyme|inducible]]) enzyme.  Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).  These drugs (such as [[rofecoxib]], [[celecoxib]], and [[etoricoxib]]) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.<ref name=\"Conaghan2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Conaghan PG | title = A turbulent decade for NSAIDs: update on current concepts of classification, epidemiology, comparative efficacy, and toxicity | journal = Rheumatology International | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1491\u2013502 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22193214 | pmc = 3364420 | doi = 10.1007/s00296-011-2263-6 }}</ref>\n\nAfter widespread adoption of the COX-2 inhibitors, it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of [[cardiovascular event]]s by 40% on average.

Patients starting morphine may experience [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (generally relieved by a short course of [[antiemetic]]s such as [[phenergan]]). [[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid.  [[Constipation]] occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and [[laxative]]s ([[lactulose]], [[macrogol]]-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed.<ref name=\"oxford\">Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 3rd ed. (Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherney I and Calman K, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>\n\nWhen used appropriately, opioids and other central analgesics are safe and effective; however, risks such as addiction and the body's becoming used to the drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect.  When safe to do so, the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness against tolerance, which may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain and requiring an analgesic over long periods. Opioid tolerance is often addressed with [[opioid rotation|opioid rotation therapy]] in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect.\n\nOpioid tolerance should not be confused with [[opioid-induced hyperalgesia]]. The symptoms of these two conditions can appear very similar but the mechanism of action is different. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is when exposure to opioids increases the sensation of pain ([[hyperalgesia]]) and can even make non-painful stimuli painful ([[allodynia]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bannister K | title = Opioid-induced hyperalgesia: where are we now? | journal = Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 116\u201321 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25872113 | doi = 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000137 }}</ref>\n\n===Alcohol===\n{{see also|Ethanol}}\nAlcohol has biological, mental, and social effects which influence the consequences of using alcohol for pain.<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zale EL, Maisto SA, Ditre JW | title = Interrelations between pain and alcohol: An integrative review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 37 | pages = 57\u201371 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25766100 | pmc = 4385458 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.02.005 }}</ref> Moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types of pain in certain circumstances.<ref name=\"ZaleMaisto2015\" />\n\nThe majority of its analgesic effects come from antagonizing NMDA receptors, similarly to ketamine, thus decreasing the activity of the primary excitatory (signal boosting) neurotransmitter, glutamate.

Both first-generation (such as [[amitriptyline]]) and newer antidepressants (such as [[duloxetine]]) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems.  Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[carisoprodol]], or [[tripelennamine]] to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.\n\nAdjuvant analgesics, also called atypical analgesics, include [[orphenadrine]], [[mexiletine]], [[pregabalin]], [[gabapentin]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[hyoscine]] (scopolamine), and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.\n\n[[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of and reverse tolerance to opioids, as well as to exert additional analgesia by acting upon [[NMDA]] receptors, as does [[ketamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hewitt DJ | title = The use of NMDA-receptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic pain | journal = The Clinical Journal of Pain | volume = 16 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S73-9 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870744 | doi = 10.1097/00002508-200006001-00013 }}</ref> Some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott KJ, Brodsky M, Hyanansky A, Foley KM, Inturrisi CE | title = Dextromethorphan shows efficacy in experimental pain (nociception) and opioid tolerance | journal = Neurology | volume = 45 | issue = 12 Suppl 8 | pages = S66-8 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8545027 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.45.12_Suppl_8.S66 | publisher = NEUROLOGY, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nHigh-alcohol [[liquor]], two forms of which were found in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressant effects of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], a notable example being the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willian|first1=Ronald S.|title=NDMA on Lower Back Pain|journal=The Gold Rush|date=1 May 2015|volume=CCXXIX|issue=Cincinnati|pages=38|url=http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|access-date=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426071810/http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|archive-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.\n\nThe [[anticonvulsant]] [[carbamazepine]] is used to treat neuropathic pain. Similarly, the [[Gabapentinoid|gabapentinoids]] [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] are prescribed for neuropathic pain, and phenibut is available without prescription. Gabapentinoids work as \u03b12\u03b4-subunit blockers of [[voltage-gated calcium channel|voltage-gated calcium channels]], and tend to have other mechanisms of action as well. Gabapentinoids are all [[Anticonvulsant|anticonvulsants]], which are most commonly used for neuropathic pain, as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation originating from the nervous system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drug Treatment in Urology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2008| first1 = Ian | last1 = Eardley | first2 = Peter | last2 = Whelan | first3 = Roger | last3 = Kirby | first4 = Anthony | last4 = Schaeffer | name-list-format = vanc |page=65|chapter=Drugs Used In The Treatment Of Interstitial Cystitis}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n\nTopical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.

[[Lidocaine]], an [[anesthetic]], and [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into joints for longer-term pain relief.  Lidocaine is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the bloodstream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine in a cream, ointment, or gel.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019055341/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm |date=October 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nTopical [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] provide pain relief in common conditions such as muscle sprains and overuse injuries.

Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 ([[Constitutive enzyme|constitutive]]) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 ([[Adaptive enzyme|inducible]]) enzyme.  Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).

[[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid.

Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref>\n\nWhen used appropriately, opioids and other central analgesics are safe and effective; however, risks such as addiction and the body's becoming used to the drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect.  When safe to do so, the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness against tolerance, which may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain and requiring an analgesic over long periods. Opioid tolerance is often addressed with [[opioid rotation|opioid rotation therapy]] in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect.\n\nOpioid tolerance should not be confused with [[opioid-induced hyperalgesia]]. The symptoms of these two conditions can appear very similar but the mechanism of action is different.

Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[carisoprodol]], or [[tripelennamine]] to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.\n\nAdjuvant analgesics, also called atypical analgesics, include [[orphenadrine]], [[mexiletine]], [[pregabalin]], [[gabapentin]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[hyoscine]] (scopolamine), and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.\n\n[[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of and reverse tolerance to opioids, as well as to exert additional analgesia by acting upon [[NMDA]] receptors, as does [[ketamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hewitt DJ | title = The use of NMDA-receptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic pain | journal = The Clinical Journal of Pain | volume = 16 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S73-9 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870744 | doi = 10.1097/00002508-200006001-00013 }}</ref> Some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott KJ, Brodsky M, Hyanansky A, Foley KM, Inturrisi CE | title = Dextromethorphan shows efficacy in experimental pain (nociception) and opioid tolerance | journal = Neurology | volume = 45 | issue = 12 Suppl 8 | pages = S66-8 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8545027 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.45.12_Suppl_8.S66 | publisher = NEUROLOGY, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nHigh-alcohol [[liquor]], two forms of which were found in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressant effects of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], a notable example being the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willian|first1=Ronald S.|title=NDMA on Lower Back Pain|journal=The Gold Rush|date=1 May 2015|volume=CCXXIX|issue=Cincinnati|pages=38|url=http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|access-date=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426071810/http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|archive-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.\n\nThe [[anticonvulsant]] [[carbamazepine]] is used to treat neuropathic pain. Similarly, the [[Gabapentinoid|gabapentinoids]] [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] are prescribed for neuropathic pain, and phenibut is available without prescription. Gabapentinoids work as \u03b12\u03b4-subunit blockers of [[voltage-gated calcium channel|voltage-gated calcium channels]], and tend to have other mechanisms of action as well. Gabapentinoids are all [[Anticonvulsant|anticonvulsants]], which are most commonly used for neuropathic pain, as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation originating from the nervous system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drug Treatment in Urology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2008| first1 = Ian | last1 = Eardley | first2 = Peter | last2 = Whelan | first3 = Roger | last3 = Kirby | first4 = Anthony | last4 = Schaeffer | name-list-format = vanc |page=65|chapter=Drugs Used In The Treatment Of Interstitial Cystitis}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n\nTopical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.  Painful joints, for example, may be treated with an [[ibuprofen]]- or [[diclofenac]]-containing gel (The labeling for topical diclofenac has been updated to warn about drug-induced hepatotoxicity.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm193047.htm Voltaren Gel (diclofenac sodium topical gel) 1% \u2013 Hepatic Effects Labeling Changes<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108173957/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm193047.htm |date=2014-01-08 }}</ref>); [[capsaicin]] also is used [[topical cream|topical]]ly.  [[Lidocaine]], an [[anesthetic]], and [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into joints for longer-term pain relief.  Lidocaine is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the bloodstream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine in a cream, ointment, or gel.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019055341/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm |date=October 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== List of drugs with comparison ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|+ <big>Comparison of different analgesics</big>\n|-\n!
