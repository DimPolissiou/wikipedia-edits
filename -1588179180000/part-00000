While attending the [[London School of Economics]] in the 1960s Schechter became an anti-apartheid activist and made trips to [[South Africa]] on behalf of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). Later he would help musician [[Steven Van Zandt]] assemble other performers to form [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] who released the album ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'' in 1985. Schechter produced and directed six nonfiction films about [[Nelson Mandela]] from the time Mandela was a [[political prisoner]] to his election and service as [[President of South Africa]].\n\nSchechter's first job in media was with [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN-FM]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] during the 1970s where he became known as \"Danny Schechter, the news dissector\", a nickname that stuck throughout his life.

It stars [[Michael J. Fox]] as teenager [[Marty McFly]], who accidentally [[Time travel|travels back in time]] from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. [[Christopher Lloyd]] portrays the eccentric scientist [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], his friend and the inventor of the [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]], who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. The cast also includes [[Lea Thompson]] as Marty's mother [[Lorraine Baines-McFly |Lorraine]], [[Crispin Glover]] as his father [[George McFly |George]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]] as [[Biff Tannen]], Marty and George's arch-nemesis.\n\nZemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale wondered whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. Film studios rejected it until the financial success of Zemeckis' ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. Zemeckis approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who agreed to produce the project at [[Amblin Entertainment]], with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] as distributor. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, but he was busy filming his television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', and [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast; after the filmmakers decided he was wrong for the role, a deal was struck to allow Fox to film ''Back to the Future'' without interrupting his television schedule.\n\n''Back to the Future'' was released on July 3, 1985. It was an immediate [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. It received widespread critical acclaim aimed at its humor, writing, direction, visuals, and the performances of Fox and Lloyd. It grossed over $381 million worldwide, becoming the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]]. It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]], and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing |Best Sound Effects Editing]]. It received three Academy Award nominations, five [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations, and four [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)]]. In 2007, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in June 2008 the [[American Film Institute]]'s special [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] designated it the 10th-best science fiction film. The film began a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|franchise]] including two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated series]], a [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park ride]], several [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], a series of [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Comic books|comic books]], and a [[Back to the Future (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], [[Marty McFly]] visits the home and lab of his friend, [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], an eccentric scientist. Though missing for several days, Doc calls the lab and asks Marty to pick up some equipment for a special experiment later that night.\n\nAt school, Marty meets his girlfriend, [[Jennifer Parker]], and after being berated by the principal and failing his audition for the [[Battle of the Bands]], he confides in Jennifer that he fears that he will become like his parents despite his ambitions. At home, Marty's cowardly father [[George McFly|George]] is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]], while his mother [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine]] is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car and [[Florence Nightingale effect|she subsequently nursed him back to health.]]\n\nMarty meets Doc at a parking lot by a shopping mall at 1:16 A.M. on October 26. Doc unveils a time machine [[DeLorean time machine|built from a modified DeLorean]] and powered by [[plutonium]] obtained from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan]] terrorists with the promise of building a nuclear bomb. While showing Marty the controls, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955, the day he conceived a time travel device. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly and open fire on them, finally shooting Doc when he surrenders. Marty escapes in the DeLorean and inadvertently activates the time machine in the process.\n\nMarty finds himself transported to November 5, 1955, without any plutonium to return. He encounters the teenage George and discovers that Biff has been bullying him since high school. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him.\n\nMarty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. Doc is unimpressed with Marty's knowledge of the future but finally believes him when he accurately recounts how Doc invented time travel. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21\u00a0GW of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night, November 12. When Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently [[Temporal paradox|alter the future]], they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting by saving George from the car. Doc warns Marty that he must find a way for Lorraine to fall in love with George or he will be erased from existence. Marty attempts to correct his parents' history and warn Doc of the future dangers, but both strategies fail: his attempts to introduce his parents backfire during a confrontation with Biff and Doc refuses to listen to any information about the future, saying no one should know too much about their own destiny.\n\nAfter Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty devises a plan with George: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to \"rescue\" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff gets rid of Marty, making his gang lock him in the trunk of the performing band's car and attempts to force himself on Lorraine. Marty is then rescued by the band who unlock the trunk and drive away Biff's gang, and rushes to stop him. Meanwhile, George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine accompanies him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band, securing his existence in the future.\n\nAs the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985 a few minutes before his original departure. After watching Doc get shot again, he grieves until Doc gets up and reveals that he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a [[bulletproof vest]]. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that his father is now a self-confident and successful author, his mother is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious [[Auto detailing|auto valet]]. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc reappears with the DeLorean and insists that they return with him to aid their future children. The trio boards the DeLorean, which now flies, and travels into the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

It stars [[Michael J. Fox]] as teenager [[Marty McFly]], who accidentally [[Time travel|travels back in time]] from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. [[Christopher Lloyd]] portrays the eccentric scientist [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], his friend and the inventor of the [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]], who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. The cast also includes [[Lea Thompson]] as Marty's mother [[Lorraine Baines-McFly |Lorraine]], [[Crispin Glover]] as his father [[George McFly |George]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]] as [[Biff Tannen]], Marty and George's arch-nemesis.\n\nZemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale wondered whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. Film studios rejected it until the financial success of Zemeckis' ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. Zemeckis approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who agreed to produce the project at [[Amblin Entertainment]], with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] as distributor. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, but he was busy filming his television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', and [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast; after the filmmakers decided he was wrong for the role, a deal was struck to allow Fox to film ''Back to the Future'' without interrupting his television schedule.\n\n''Back to the Future'' was released on July 3, 1985. It grossed over $381 million worldwide, becoming the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]]. It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]], and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing |Best Sound Effects Editing]]. It received three Academy Award nominations, five [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations, and four [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)]]. In 2007, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in June 2008 the [[American Film Institute]]'s special [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] designated it the 10th-best science fiction film. The film began a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|franchise]] including two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated series]], a [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park ride]], several [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], a series of [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Comic books|comic books]], and a [[Back to the Future (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], [[Marty McFly]] visits the home and lab of his friend, [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], an eccentric scientist. Though missing for several days, Doc calls the lab and asks Marty to pick up some equipment for a special experiment later that night.\n\nAt school, Marty meets his girlfriend, [[Jennifer Parker]], and after being berated by the principal and failing his audition for the [[Battle of the Bands]], he confides in Jennifer that he fears that he will become like his parents despite his ambitions. At home, Marty's cowardly father [[George McFly|George]] is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]], while his mother [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine]] is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car and [[Florence Nightingale effect|she subsequently nursed him back to health.]]\n\nMarty meets Doc at a parking lot by a shopping mall at 1:16 A.M. on October 26. Doc unveils a time machine [[DeLorean time machine|built from a modified DeLorean]] and powered by [[plutonium]] obtained from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan]] terrorists with the promise of building a nuclear bomb. While showing Marty the controls, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955, the day he conceived a time travel device. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly and open fire on them, finally shooting Doc when he surrenders. Marty escapes in the DeLorean and inadvertently activates the time machine in the process.\n\nMarty finds himself transported to November 5, 1955, without any plutonium to return. He encounters the teenage George and discovers that Biff has been bullying him since high school. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him.\n\nMarty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. Doc is unimpressed with Marty's knowledge of the future but finally believes him when he accurately recounts how Doc invented time travel. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21\u00a0GW of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night, November 12. When Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently [[Temporal paradox|alter the future]], they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting by saving George from the car. Doc warns Marty that he must find a way for Lorraine to fall in love with George or he will be erased from existence. Marty attempts to correct his parents' history and warn Doc of the future dangers, but both strategies fail: his attempts to introduce his parents backfire during a confrontation with Biff and Doc refuses to listen to any information about the future, saying no one should know too much about their own destiny.\n\nAfter Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty devises a plan with George: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to \"rescue\" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff gets rid of Marty, making his gang lock him in the trunk of the performing band's car and attempts to force himself on Lorraine. Marty is then rescued by the band who unlock the trunk and drive away Biff's gang, and rushes to stop him. Meanwhile, George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine accompanies him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band, securing his existence in the future.\n\nAs the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985 a few minutes before his original departure. After watching Doc get shot again, he grieves until Doc gets up and reveals that he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a [[bulletproof vest]]. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that his father is now a self-confident and successful author, his mother is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious [[Auto detailing|auto valet]]. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc reappears with the DeLorean and insists that they return with him to aid their future children. The trio boards the DeLorean, which now flies, and travels into the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

Zemeckis advised Silvestri to make his compositions grand and epic, despite the film's small scale, to impress Spielberg. Silvestri began recording the score two weeks before the first preview. He also suggested that [[Huey Lewis and the News]] create the theme song. Their first attempt was rejected by Universal, before they recorded \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\".<ref name=NBC /> The studio loved the final song but were disappointed it did not feature the film's title, so they had to send memos to radio stations to always mention its association with ''Back to the Future''.<ref name=freer /> In the end, the track \"[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]\" was featured in the film, playing during the scene when Marty wakes up after his return to 1985 and also during the end credits.<ref name=NBC />\n\nAlthough it appears that Fox is actually playing a guitar, music supervisor [[Bones Howe]] hired Hollywood guitar coach and musician [[Paul Hanson (guitarist) |Paul Hanson]] to teach Fox to simulate playing all the parts so it would look realistic, including playing behind his head.
