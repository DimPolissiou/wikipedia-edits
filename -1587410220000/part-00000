An adaptation of [[Ga\u00e9tan Soucy]]'s novel of the [[The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches|same name]], the film centres on Alice Soissons (Marine Johnson), a girl raised to believe she is a boy, who lives in with her father and brother in oppressive and secluded conditions. When her father dies, she ventures into the village, where outsiders tell her she is female, and she fears the family home is now under threat.\n\nThe adaptation was filmed in Montreal, Quebec and the [[Laurentides]] and shot in black and white. It premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was nominated for seven [[6th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn rural 1930s Quebec, Alice lives in house with older brother, known only as Fr\u00e8re, and their father Mr. Soissons, a [[recluse]] who is feared and hated in the village. Armed with rifles, Soissons and Fr\u00e8re forbid anyone from entering their property. Soissons has raised Alice as a boy, cutting her hair short and [[breast binding]] her, and tells her she is a boy whose penis fell off when she was small. Soissons also tells his children he created them out of clay. As Alice has doubts as to these stories, Fr\u00e8re finds her outside of the house reading a book, the memoirs of the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]], that Soissons has banned. Fr\u00e8re [[rape]]s her. Later, Alice finds Soissons in the shed, where he is feeding pieces of food to a mysterious person in chains; Soissons describes this as a \"just punishment,\" the figure being known as Juste. At night, Mr. Soissons enters his children's bedroom and inspects Alice, discovering she is pregnant. He begins beating Fr\u00e8re, whom he realizes has impregnated her, though neither of his children understand this.\n\nSoissons commits [[suicide by hanging]]; Fr\u00e8re and Alice discover the nude body. They decide the body must be buried, but Alice declares they need a coffin and takes Mr. Soissons' horse to the village, where she has never been before. As she rides the horse, she feels sexually stimulated, until she comes across a church in congregation. Drawn in by the music, she leads her horse into the building, where the attendees and priest react with shock and anger. They drag her out, and force her to reveal that Mr. Soissons is dead, and that he had two \"sons\", one of whom is her. When she bites the priest's hand, he angrily orders her taken away. Several men take her to a barn and tie her to a pole. One of the churchgoers, a young man named Paul-Marie, then enters and unties her, tells her she is female, and notices she is pregnant. Paul-Marie tells her the villagers will come to the house since they know Mr. Soissons is dead, and that Alice will likely be confined to an orphanage or convent.\n\nAlice returns to the house to warn Fr\u00e8re that the villagers will come, believing they are evil, and finds Fr\u00e8re trying to dismember their father's body to bury it. Fr\u00e8re picks up a rifle and declares himself the new master of the domain; Alice tells him to feel her belly, as she has experienced [[quickening]]. She then goes to the shed, where she frees Juste, a scarred and [[muteness|mute]] woman. Alice tells Juste she has learned where life comes from. Paul-Marie arrives to warn Alice and Fr\u00e8re that the priest, coroner, pathologist and armed police are marching to the property. Fr\u00e8re chases Paul-Marie off the land with his rifle, but Alice climbs onto Paul-Marie's motorcycle as they attempt to escape. Fr\u00e8re fires his weapon, killing Paul-Marie and causing the motorcycle to crash.\n\nThe villagers capture and restrain Fr\u00e8re while Alice stands over Juste with an ax. Alice gathers her belongings and goes back into the house, where she finds a charred corpse she refers to as Mama. As Alice's [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]], she [[flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to a little girl playing with a [[sparkler]] as a girl, in the presence of her mother. When the sparkler runs out, the first girl's young sister picked up matches and lit one, accidentally igniting the dress of the first girl. The mother attempted to save the girl, but also caught fire. The father rushed in and attempted to put out the fire on his daughter, leaving his wife to burn. In the present, Alice lights matches again and proceeds to burn the house down. In labour, she wanders into the forest, where she gives birth and clutches her child.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Who Was Too Fond of Matches''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes'''}}) is a 2017 Canadian drama film directed by [[Simon Lavoie]] and starring [[Marine Johnson]], [[Antoine L'\u00c9cuyer]] and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Casabonne. An adaptation of [[Ga\u00e9tan Soucy]]'s novel of the [[The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches|same name]], the film centres on Alice Soissons (Marine Johnson), a girl raised to believe she is a boy, who lives in with her father and brother in oppressive and secluded conditions. When her father dies, she ventures into the village, where outsiders tell her she is female, and she fears the family home is now under threat.\n\nThe adaptation was filmed in Montreal, Quebec and the [[Laurentides]] and shot in black and white. It premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was nominated for seven [[6th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn rural 1930s Quebec, Alice lives in house with older brother, known only as Fr\u00e8re, and their father Mr. Soissons, a [[recluse]] who is feared and hated in the village. Armed with rifles, Soissons and Fr\u00e8re forbid anyone from entering their property. Soissons has raised Alice as a boy, cutting her hair short and [[breast binding]] her, and tells her she is a boy whose penis fell off when she was small. Soissons also tells his children he created them out of clay. As Alice has doubts as to these stories, Fr\u00e8re finds her outside of the house reading a book, the memoirs of the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]], that Soissons has banned. Fr\u00e8re [[rape]]s her. Later, Alice finds Soissons in the shed, where he is feeding pieces of food to a mysterious person in chains; Soissons describes this as a \"just punishment,\" the figure being known as Juste. At night, Mr. Soissons enters his children's bedroom and inspects Alice, discovering she is pregnant. He begins beating Fr\u00e8re, whom he realizes has impregnated her, though neither of his children understand this.\n\nSoissons commits [[suicide by hanging]]; Fr\u00e8re and Alice discover the nude body. They decide the body must be buried, but Alice declares they need a coffin and takes Mr. Soissons' horse to the village, where she has never been before. As she rides the horse, she feels sexually stimulated, until she comes across a church in congregation. Drawn in by the music, she leads her horse into the building, where the attendees and priest react with shock and anger. They drag her out, and force her to reveal that Mr. Soissons is dead, and that he had two \"sons\", one of whom is her. When she bites the priest's hand, he angrily orders her taken away. Several men take her to a barn and tie her to a pole. One of the churchgoers, a young man named Paul-Marie, then enters and unties her, tells her she is female, and notices she is pregnant. Paul-Marie tells her the villagers will come to the house since they know Mr. Soissons is dead, and that Alice will likely be confined to an orphanage or convent.\n\nAlice returns to the house to warn Fr\u00e8re that the villagers will come, believing they are evil, and finds Fr\u00e8re trying to dismember their father's body to bury it. Fr\u00e8re picks up a rifle and declares himself the new master of the domain; Alice tells him to feel her belly, as she has experienced [[quickening]]. She then goes to the shed, where she frees Juste, a scarred and [[muteness|mute]] woman. Alice tells Juste she has learned where life comes from. Paul-Marie arrives to warn Alice and Fr\u00e8re that the priest, coroner, pathologist and armed police are marching to the property. Fr\u00e8re chases Paul-Marie off the land with his rifle, but Alice climbs onto Paul-Marie's motorcycle as they attempt to escape. Fr\u00e8re fires his weapon, killing Paul-Marie and causing the motorcycle to crash.\n\nThe villagers capture and restrain Fr\u00e8re while Alice stands over Juste with an ax. Alice gathers her belongings and goes back into the house, where she finds a charred corpse she refers to as Mama. As Alice's [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]], she [[flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to a little girl playing with a [[sparkler]] as a girl, in the presence of her mother. When the sparkler runs out, the first girl's young sister picked up matches and lit one, accidentally igniting the dress of the first girl. The mother attempted to save the girl, but also caught fire. The father rushed in and attempted to put out the fire on his daughter, leaving his wife to burn. In the present, Alice lights matches again and proceeds to burn the house down.

[[Max Gerson]] proposed that coffee enemas had a positive effect on the [[gastro-intestinal tract]]. Gerson said that coffee enemas had positive detoxification effects that contributed to the recovering health of his patients. He claimed that unlike [[saline (medicine)|saline]] enemas, coffee in the enema traveled through the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[small intestine]], and into the [[liver]]. This, he said, stimulated the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the same way caffeine does when consumed orally and activated the release of bile in the liver, cleared even more of the gastro-intestinal tract and removed more toxins than a normal enema. He told his patients often that the \"coffee enemas are not given for the function of the intestines but for the stimulation of the liver.\"<ref name=cancer />\n\nCoffee enemas appeared in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] manual in 1944 as a stimulating enema for the treatment of shock and poisoning, mixed with brandy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Jen|title=Did the military use coffee enemas?

[[Max Gerson]] proposed that coffee enemas had a positive effect on the [[gastro-intestinal tract]]. Gerson said that coffee enemas had positive detoxification effects that contributed to the recovering health of his patients. He claimed that unlike [[saline (medicine)|saline]] enemas, coffee in the enema traveled through the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[small intestine]], and into the [[liver]]. This, he said, stimulated the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the same way caffeine does when consumed orally and activated the release of bile in the liver, cleared even more of the gastro-intestinal tract and removed more toxins than a normal enema. He told his patients often that the \"coffee enemas are not given for the function of the intestines but for the stimulation of the liver.\"<ref name=cancer />\n\nCoffee enemas appeared in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] manual in 1944 as a stimulating enema for the treatment of shock and poisoning, mixed with brandy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Jen|title=Did the military use coffee enemas?
