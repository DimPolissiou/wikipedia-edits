The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The ground opened in 1987 and was used by the [[Brisbane Bears]] for the first six years of existence and was later used by the [[North Melbourne Kangaroos]] and several professional [[Rugby league]] teams.\n\nThe insufficient and outdated facilities at Carrara Stadium led to the [[Australian Football League]] investigating several stadium options for the Gold Coast's inaugural AFL season in 2011.

The $144.2 million upgrade would increase the stadium capacity to 25,000.\n\nConstruction for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium began in December 2009 and the Gold Coast was required to find a new home ground for the [[2010 VFL season]]. The team shared their games among local grounds [[Fankhauser Reserve]], [[H & A Oval]] and [[Cooke-Murphy Oval]]. The redevelopment ran into the [[2011 AFL season]] and the Gold Coast were again required to find a temporary home ground. The Suns elected to use [[the Gabba]] for their first three home games of the 2011 season.\n\nThe redeveloped Carrara Stadium (commercially known as Empty Stadium) was officially opened on 22 May 2011 by [[Queensland Premier]] [[Anna Bligh]]. Six days later the Gold Coast Suns hosted their first home match at the redeveloped Carrara Stadium against the Geelong Cats in front of a sell out crowd. Two months later, the Suns attracted the largest crowd ever at the Carrara Stadium in a game against Collingwood that attracted an attendance of 23,302, a record broken in round 16 of 2014 when 24,032 attended also against Collingwood. Since then the highest crowd has been 21 people.\n\nThe seating capacity was temporarily upgraded to 40,000 as part of the Gold Coast's successful bid to host the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].\n\n==Corporate==\n\n===Membership base===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:80%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"\n!

The ground opened in 1987 and was used by the [[Brisbane Bears]] for the first six years of existence and was later used by the [[North Melbourne Kangaroos]] and several professional [[Rugby league]] teams.\n\nThe insufficient and outdated facilities at Carrara Stadium led to the [[Australian Football League]] investigating several stadium options for the Gold Coast's inaugural AFL season in 2011. A new $172 million stadium in [[Helensvale, Queensland|Helensvale]] was a strongly considered option.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Geoff|title=D-day vote on $2 billion city projects|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/09/04/15858_gold-coast-feature.html|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=4 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Geoff|title=Council will chip in $10m transit centre cash for Aussie rules site|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/09/05/15906_gold-coast-top-story.html|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=5 September 2008}}</ref> The AFL eventually brokered a deal with the [[Gold Coast City Council]] and the [[Queensland Government]] to redevelop Carrara Stadium. The $144.2 million upgrade would increase the stadium capacity to 25,000.\n\nConstruction for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium began in December 2009 and the Gold Coast was required to find a new home ground for the [[2010 VFL season]]. The team shared their games among local grounds [[Fankhauser Reserve]], [[H & A Oval]] and [[Cooke-Murphy Oval]]. The redevelopment ran into the [[2011 AFL season]] and the Gold Coast were again required to find a temporary home ground. The Suns elected to use [[the Gabba]] for their first three home games of the 2011 season.\n\nThe redeveloped Carrara Stadium (commercially known as Metricon Stadium) was officially opened on 22 May 2011 by [[Queensland Premier]] [[Anna Bligh]]. Six days later the Gold Coast Suns hosted their first home match at the redeveloped Carrara Stadium against the Geelong Cats in front of a sell out crowd. Two months later, the Suns attracted the largest crowd ever at the Carrara Stadium in a game against Collingwood that attracted an attendance of 23,302, a record broken in round 16 of 2014 when 24,032 attended also against Collingwood.\n\nThe seating capacity was temporarily upgraded to 40,000 as part of the Gold Coast's successful bid to host the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].\n\n==Corporate==\n\n===Membership base===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:80%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"\n!

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

By distributing the [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] material collected by the [[Government Code & Cypher School]], for the first time, MI6 became an important branch of the government. Extensive breaches of Nazi [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] signals gave Menzies and his team enormous insight into [[Adolf Hitler]]'s strategy, and this was kept a closely held secret.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=154, 191}}\n\nThe British intelligence services signed a special agreement with their allied Polish counterparts 1940. In July 2005, the British and Polish governments jointly produced a two-tome study of bilateral intelligence cooperation in the War, which revealed information that had until then been officially secret. The ''Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee'' was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources.<ref name=\"google1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&pg=PA234 |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |first=Halik |last=Kochanski |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0674068148|pages=234-235}}</ref> This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organizations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France; a major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy. Liaison was undertaken by SIS officer [[Wilfred Dunderdale]], and reports included advanced warning of the [[Afrikakorps]]' departure for Libya, awareness of the readiness of Vichy French units to fight against the Allies or switch sides in [[Operation Torch]], and advance warning both of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and [[Operation Edelweiss]], the German Caucasus campaign. [[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance.

In a series of meetings between SIS agents and the 'conspirators', [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] plans to abduct the SIS team were shelved due to the presence of Dutch police. On the night of 8\u20139 November 1939, a meeting took place without police presence.

These included the defection to the SIS [[Tehran]] station in 1982 of [[KGB]] officer [[Vladimir Kuzichkin]], the son of a senior [[Politburo]] member and a member of the KGB's internal Second Chief Directorate who provided SIS and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] with warning of the mobilisation of the KGB's Alpha Force during the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|1991 August Coup]] which briefly toppled Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955063,00.html|title=The Soviets: Coups and Killings in Kabul|date=22 November 1982|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Time}}</ref>\n\n===After the Cold War===\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] led to a reshuffle of existing priorities. The Soviet Bloc ceased to swallow the lion's share of operational priorities, although the stability and intentions of a weakened but still nuclear-capable Federal Russia constituted a significant concern. Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues. In the mid-1990s these were consolidated into a new post of Controller, Global and Functional.<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=Controller,+Global+and+Functional+mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_R9rL&sig=T0y1Zqyx8plT752vCpx6t3kRdI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6u6Pvz-beAhWrBcAKHWIxBf0Q6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Controller%2C%20Global%20and%20Functional%20mi6&f=false p. 354]</ref>\n\nDuring the transition, then-C Sir [[Colin McColl]] embraced a new, albeit limited, policy of openness towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worthwhile going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that working with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] was the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage. The first real sources were being established, although no one penetrated the upper tier of the Al Qaeda leadership itself. As the year progressed, plans were drawn up and slowly worked their way up to the [[White House]] on 4 September 2001-which involved increasing dramatically support for Massoud. MI6 were involved in these plans.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313-314</ref>\n\n===War on Terror===\nDuring the [[Global War on Terror]], SIS accepted information from the CIA that was obtained through [[torture]], including the [[extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] programme.

At the end of the month, a handful of MI6 officers with a budget of $7 million landed in northeast Afghanistan, where they met with General [[Mohammed Fahim]] of the [[Northern Alliance]] and began working with other contacts in the north and south to build alliances, secure support, and to bribe as many [[Taliban]] commanders as they could to change sides or leave the fight.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.335</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]], the SIS established a presence in [[Kabul]] following its [[Fall of Kabul|fall to the coalition]].<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain\u2019s War in Afghanistan, 2001\u20132014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.82</ref> MI6 members and the British [[Special Boat Service]] took part in the [[Battle of Tora Bora]].<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref> After members of the 22nd [[Special Air Service|Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment]] returned to the UK in mid-December 2001, members of both territorial SAS regiments remained in the country to provide close protection to SIS members.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.75</ref> \n\nIn mid-December, MI6 officers who had been deployed to the region began to interview prisoners held by the Northern Alliance. In January 2002, they began interviewing prisoners held by the Americans. On 10 January 2002, an MI6 officer conducted his first interview of a detainee held by the Americans. He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In the months after the invasion, they also began gathering political intelligence; predicting what would happen in post-Baathist Iraq. MI6 personnel in the country never exceeded 50; in early 2004, apart from supporting [[Task Force 88 (anti-terrorist unit)#Task Force Black/Knight|Task Force Black]] in hunting down former senior Ba'athist party members, MI6 also made an effort to target \"transnational terrorism\"/jihadist networks that led to the SAS carrying out Operation Aston in February 2004: They conducted a raid on a house in Baghdad that was part of a \"jihadist pipeline\" that ran from Iran to Iraq that US and UK intelligence agencies were tracking suspects on \u2013 the raid captured members of [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|Pakistan based terrorist group]].<ref name=\"urban\">Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|1250006961}} {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, pp.10\u201311, p.13, p.15, p.18\u201319, p.50-55, p.56-57, p.67-68, p.95-96, p.101, p.249</ref>\n\nShortly before the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], MI6 personnel visited [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]s TSF (Temporary Screening Facility) at [[Balad Air Base]] to question a suspected insurgent. Afterwards they raised concerns about the poor detention conditions there. As a result the British government informed JSOC in Iraq that prisoners captured by British special forces would only be turned over to JSOC if there was an undertaking not to send them to Balad. In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers. MI6 provided information that enabled the detachment to carry out surveillance operations. MI6 were also involved in resolving the [[Basra prison incident]]; the SIS played a central role in the British withdrawal from Basra in 2007.<ref name=\"urban\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, MI6 worked closely with the military, delivering tactical information and working in small cells alongside Special Forces, surveillance teams, and GCHQ to track individuals from the Taliban and Al Qaeda.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.399-400</ref>\n\nThe first MI6 knew of the US carrying out the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|mission that killed Osama Bin Laden]] on 2 May 2011 was after it happened, when its chief called his American counterpart for an explanation.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.351</ref> In July 2011 it was reported that SIS had closed several of its stations, particularly in Iraq, where it had several outposts in the south of the country in the region of Basra.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been too close to the Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists. Mr Hague also defended controversial proposals for secrecy in civil courts in cases involving intelligence material.<ref name=\"Radnedge\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported in November 2011 that SIS helped capture [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]]. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him along with his friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding out in the desert for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say he was safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location.

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

In August 1919, Cumming created the new passport control department, providing diplomatic cover for agents abroad.

At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues.

McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worth while going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] were the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage.

In January 2002, they began interviewing prisoners held by the Americans. On 10 January 2002, an MI6 officer conducted his first interview of a detainee held by the Americans. He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said.

She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.
