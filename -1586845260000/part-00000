Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours on Internet [[chat room]]s with his girlfriends and aspiring to be a [[Cage fighting|cage fighter]]. Napoleon [[daydream]]s his way through school, doodling [[liger]]s and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock Don and the school bully Randy. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself and his outlandish \"skills\" while having a sullen and aloof personality.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother breaks her [[coccyx]] in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious steak-loving former athlete who lives in a [[campervan]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and his recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua|Juarez]], [[Mexico]]. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon out of pity.\n\nInspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The two candidates' factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] and buys an instructional dance [[VHS]] called ''D-Qwon's Dance Grooves'', becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend LaFawnduh arrives from [[Detroit]] and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger than Life]]\" by the [[Backstreet Boys]] with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" by [[Jamiroquai]]. Napoleon's routine receives a [[standing ovation]] from students, stunning Summer and her boyfriend Don.\n\nThe film concludes with Pedro becoming the class president, Kip and LaFawnduh leaving on a bus for Michigan, Rico reuniting with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returning from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconciling and playing [[tetherball]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Kip and LaFawnduh are married in an outdoor ceremony in Preston.

Audiences at test screenings were confused about when the film was set. Eight months after the film was completed, the title sequence was filmed in cinematographer Munn Powell's basement.<ref name=\"hess-aott\">{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/2010/08/30/napoleon-dynamite/ | title = A Q&A with director Jared Hess. |first=Alexander |last=Ulloa | accessdate = 2010-09-03 |work = [[Art of the Title]]}}</ref> [[Aaron Ruell]], who played Kip, suggested the idea of the title sequence. The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a [[Lemonhead (candy)|Lemonheads]] box or a tube of [[ChapStick]] had the credits printed on them. Hess explains:\n{{Quote|text=So this question came up a few times and the Fox Searchlight marketing people were like \"maybe we could do something to say that this is happening now\" because I kept explaining to them that I grew up in a small town in Idaho and that things are more, you know, functional and fashion doesn't matter as much ... It's kind of weird, but because they wanted to show that the film takes place now, there's a title where a hand pulls Napoleon's school ID out of a wallet and it says \"2004\"<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\nOn the studio's reaction to the sequence, Hess adds:\n{{Quote|text=We actually had Jon Heder placing all the objects in and out [of frame], and then showed it to Searchlight who really liked it and thought it was great, but some lady over there was like \"There are some hangnails or something \u2014 the hands look kinda gross!

This, of course, was my first interaction with a studio at all, so they flew out a hand model a couple weeks later, who had great hands but was five or six shades darker than Jon Heder. So we reshot, but they're now intermixed, so if you look there are like three different dudes' hands (our producers are in there too). It all worked out great, though, and was a lot of fun.<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\n\n===Dance scene===\nThe Hesses wrote the climactic dance scene because they knew Heder liked to dance.<ref name=\"dance scene\">{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Patail |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2012/2/27/interview-with-jon-heder-of-napoleon-dynamite-february-2012 |title=Exclusive Interview with Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite |work=[[Portland Monthly]] |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2018-08-15 }}</ref> \"Jared's wife was like, 'Jon, I hear you're pretty good dancer. I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\"\n\nWhen it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\"/>\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\nThe dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\">{{cite video |title=Napoleon Dynamite-(Commentary by Jared Hess, Actor Jon Heder and Producer Jeremy Coon) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |date=2005}}</ref> \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.'

I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n\"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive. So we danced to three different songs. To that song and another Jamiroquai song, \"[[Little L]].\" We danced to Michael Jackson, something off of ''[[Off the Wall]]''. Just those three. And then we got the rights to Jamiroquai. And I think that was half our budget.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n===Origin of the name \"Napoleon Dynamite\"===\nUpon the film's release, it was noted that the name \"Napoleon Dynamite\" had originally been used by musician [[Elvis Costello]], most visibly on his 1986 album ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.elviscostello.info/disc/official/bac/bac_info_a02.htm |title = Blood And Chocolate (reissue) - Elvis Costello And The Attractions |work = The Elvis Costello Home Page |date=October 1, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/trivia |title=Napoleon Dynamite (2004): Trivia|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> although he had used the pseudonym on a single B-side as early as 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/disc/official/ib/ib_info_s02.htm |title=The Elvis Costello Home Page |work=The Elvis Costello Home Page |date=1982-07-23 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> Filmmaker [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] states that he was not aware of Costello's use of the name until two days before the end of shooting, when he was informed by a teenage [[extra (actor)|extra]].<ref name=\"stereogum\">{{cite web |work=[[Stereogum]] |url=http://stereogum.com/archives/napoleon-dynamite-vs-elvis-costello_000693.html |title=Napoleon Dynamite vs. Elvis Costello |date=July 10, 2004}}</ref> He later said, \"Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film, it definitely would have been changed&nbsp;...

Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours on Internet [[chat room]]s with his girlfriends and aspiring to be a [[Cage fighting|cage fighter]]. Napoleon [[daydream]]s his way through school, doodling [[liger]]s and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock Don and the school bully Randy. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself and his outlandish \"skills\" while having a sullen and aloof personality.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother breaks her [[coccyx]] in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious steak-loving former athlete who lives in a [[campervan]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and his recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua|Juarez]], [[Mexico]]. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon out of pity.\n\nInspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The two candidates' factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] and buys an instructional dance [[VHS]] called ''D-Qwon's Dance Grooves'', becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend LaFawnduh arrives from [[Detroit]] and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger than Life]]\" by the [[Backstreet Boys]] with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" by [[Jamiroquai]]. Napoleon's routine receives a [[standing ovation]] from students, stunning Summer and her boyfriend Don.\n\nThe film concludes with Pedro becoming the class president, Kip and LaFawnduh leaving on a bus for Michigan, Rico reuniting with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returning from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconciling and playing [[tetherball]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Kip and LaFawnduh are married in an outdoor ceremony in Preston. Napoleon, absent for the vows, arrives riding a horse, claiming that it is a \"wild honeymoon stallion\" that he has tamed himself. Kip flicks LaFawnduh's garter as a keepsake towards Napoleon, Pedro, and Rico (who catches it) before he and LaFawnduh ride off across the fields.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Napoleon Dynamite cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The cast of ''Napoleon Dynamite'' (from left to right: Majorino, Martin, Heder, Ruell, Ramirez, Gries, and Bader)]]\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Napoleon Dynamite\n* [[Efren Ramirez]] as Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as Deborah \"Deb\" Bradshaw\n* [[Aaron Ruell]] as Kipland \"Kip\" Dynamite\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Rico Dynamite\n* [[Haylie Duff]] as Summer Wheatley\n* [[Emily Dunn (actress)|Emily Kennard]] as Trisha Stevens\n* [[Shondrella Avery]] as LaFawnduh Lucas\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Grandma Carlinda Dynamite\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Rex\n* Trevor Snarr as Don\n* [[Ellen Dubin]] as Aunt Ilene\n\n==Production==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Pedros house from Napoleon Dynamite.jpg|thumb|right|Pedro's house, located in Preston, Idaho.]]\n{{See also|Peluca}}\n[[Jon Heder]] and [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] were students at the film program at [[Brigham Young University]] in 2002 and decided to collaborate on a class project.

The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a [[Lemonhead (candy)|Lemonheads]] box or a tube of [[ChapStick]] had the credits printed on them. Hess explains:\n{{Quote|text=So this question came up a few times and the Fox Searchlight marketing people were like \"maybe we could do something to say that this is happening now\" because I kept explaining to them that I grew up in a small town in Idaho and that things are more, you know, functional and fashion doesn't matter as much ... It's kind of weird, but because they wanted to show that the film takes place now, there's a title where a hand pulls Napoleon's school ID out of a wallet and it says \"2004\"<ref name=\"hess-aott\"/>}}\nOn the studio's reaction to the sequence, Hess adds:\n{{Quote|text=We actually had Jon Heder placing all the objects in and out [of frame], and then showed it to Searchlight who really liked it and thought it was great, but some lady over there was like \"There are some hangnails or something \u2014 the hands look kinda gross! It's really bothering me, can we re-shoot some of those? We'll send you guys a [[hand model]].\" We were like \"WHAT?!\". This, of course, was my first interaction with a studio at all, so they flew out a hand model a couple weeks later, who had great hands but was five or six shades darker than Jon Heder. So we reshot, but they're now intermixed, so if you look there are like three different dudes' hands (our producers are in there too).

I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\"\n\nWhen it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\"/>\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\nThe dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\">{{cite video |title=Napoleon Dynamite-(Commentary by Jared Hess, Actor Jon Heder and Producer Jeremy Coon) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |date=2005}}</ref> \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.' So I just winged it. I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n\"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive.
