The Symbiotes bond with their hosts, creating a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bond through which a single entity is created. They also are able to slightly alter their hosts' personalities, and/or memories by influencing their darkest desires and wants, along with amplifying their physical and emotional traits and personality, granting them super-human abilities. The first and most well-known symbiote is [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], who originally attached itself to Spider-Man during the [[Secret Wars|''Secret Wars'']] storyline, but after Spider-Man rejected it, Venom instead attached itself to [[Eddie Brock]], and together they became one of Spider-Man's [[Archenemy|archenemies]]; the Venom symbiote would go on to have numerous other hosts, some of them villains as well, such as [[Mac Gargan]], some heroes, such as [[Flash Thompson]] (who became Agent Venom). Other well-known symbiotes are [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], whose most common host is serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]], and [[Anti-Venom]].\n\nThe symbiotes have appeared in various media. Venom has been the most featured one, apperaing as one of the main antagonists of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and the titular protagonist and [[antihero]] of ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''; the latter also featured other symbiotes, most notably [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], who served as the film's main antagonist.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first appearance(s) of a symbiote occurs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #90, and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #141 (released concurrently in May 1984), in which [[Spider-Man]] brings one home to Earth after the [[Secret Wars]] (''Secret Wars'' #8, which was released months later, details of his first encounter with it). The concept was created by a Marvel Comics reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller\u2019s Brush With Comic History &#124; Comics Should Be Good! | publisher=ComicBookResources.com |date=16 May 2007|access-date=2010-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521201414/https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-extra-randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> with the publisher purchasing the idea for $220. The original design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Venom symbiote. The concept would be explored and used throughout multiple story lines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ign.com/articles/2019/03/01/the-impact-of-venoms-grand-new-origin|title=The Impact of Venom's Grand New Origin|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2 March 2019|access-date=2019-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306111820/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/01/the-impact-of-venoms-grand-new-origin|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Fictional history ==\nSymbiotes were originally created by an ancient malevolent primordial deity named [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]. When the [[Celestials]] began their vast plan to evolve the universe, Knull, seeing that his \"Kingdom\" was being touched, retaliated by constructing All-Black, the first symbiote, and decapitated a Celestial. Then, the other Celestials banished Knull along with the severed Celestial head deeper in the Void. After that, he started using the head with its Cosmic energies as a Forge for the symbiotes, where they got the weaknesses of sound and fire \u2013 the head would later become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep!

However, when a dragon-like composite went to the medieval Earth, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeated it and destroyed the connection between Knull and the symbiotes. Upon Knull's severed connection to the symbiotes, the symbiote hive-mind began to explore notions of honor and nobility as they bonded to benevolent hosts. The symbiotes subsequently rebelled against their god, imprisoning him at the heart of an artificial planet in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] they called Klyntar, which is their species name. Ashamed of their dark past, the symbiotes desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors.<ref name=Ve4/> However, these [[Altruism|altruistic]] goals were imperfect, as the Klyntar symbiotes could be corrupted by hosts with harmful chemical imbalances or problematic personality attributes, turning them into destructive parasites who would spread lies and disinformation about their own kind in order to make other peoples fear and hate the Klyntar species as a whole.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller = Valerio Schiti|inker = Valerio Schiti|title = Guardians of the Galaxy|volume = 3|issue = #23|date = 21 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a spacefaring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking whole planets and reestablishing the Imperium. The corrupted Symbiotes forced their hosts to perform death-defying feats in order to feed off of the resulting surges of hormones like adrenaline and phenethylamine.

It used Richard's Rna as the starting base for it, thus himself and [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]] are \"related\" to it. When bonding to a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, casing, similar to a [[pupa]]. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration. When worn by a host other than Richard's son Peter, the host is compelled to take the life energy of other human beings or else have their own be consumed by the suit instead. The original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos|colorist=Transparency Digital|letterer=VC's Chris Eliopoulos|editor=Ralph Macchio, Brian Smith, [[C.B.

In the conclusion of [[The Alien Costume]], Venom is defeated by Spider-Man and sent into space, however [[Dormammu]] and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the rocket allowing Venom back to Earth. When Venom fails to get a [[Stark Industries]] portal device for Mordo, they bond Venom's offspring who Cletus Kasady coins Carnage and send him to help Venom. With help from [[Iron Man]], Eddie Brock willingly separates from Venom, after having a change of heart. When Carnage kidnaps [[Ashley Kafka]] who Eddie is in love with Eddie rejoins with the symbiote and helps Spider-Man, Iron Man and [[War Machine (comics)|War Machine]]. When Carnage attempts to throw Kafka into limbo the place between portals Venom stops him and knocks them both into limbo, foiling Dormannu's plans for good. During the [[Spider Wars]] season finale, Carnage bonds with an alternate dejected Spider-Man to create [[Spider Carnage]].\n* In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage are primary villains, who in the pilot episode board a shuttle piloted by [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] for [[Counter-Earth]] to start a new empire of Symbiotes. Here the symbiotes are more [[amorphous]] creatures that rely on stretching bodies then webbing, and are more exaggerated such as Carnage sporting spikes. The in-universe explanation is that the Symbiotes have bonded completely with their hosts, although under the Synoptic's guide Venom & Carnage learned their shapeshifting abilities (into liquid, etc.) as Spidey referred to that as \"new powers\". \n* Venom appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. In the episode \"The Uncertainly Principle\", the Symbiote arrives on Earth by stowing away on the [[space shuttle]]. After being rejected by Spider-Man, it bonds with Eddie in the episode \"Intervention\", and is ultimately defeated in the episode \"Nature vs. Nurture\". Venom reappeared in the Season Two episodes \"First Steps\", \"Growing Pains\", and \"Identity Crisis\", where he attempts to expose Spider-Man's secret identity but his plans are foiled. Carnage was also set to appear in the third season.\n* The Venom, Carnage, and Anti-Venom Symbiotes appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Venom and Anti-Venom are created by Doctor Octopus for [[Oscorp]]. Venom was created by altering a sample of Spider-Man's DNA and Anti-Venom was created from the Venom sample used to counter and destroy the Venom Symbiote. The Carnage symbiote is created by Green Goblin and later recreated by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] from the Venom symbiote he obtained.\n* In the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"The Venom Within,\" Doctor Octopus creates \"Gamma Venom\" by having the Venom Symbiote combine with each members of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. This version of the Venom Symbiote is destroyed by the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Spider-Man.\n* The Symbiotes appear in the animated ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' series that debuted in 2015. Their origins revealed in the three-part \"Symbiote War\" as originally Klyntar who were altered by [[Thanos]] in his experiments on the mining planet later revealed to be what remained of Groot's homeworld. The Exolons are also referenced inhabiting [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]]'s body.\n* The Venom Symbiote appears in the animated ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, referred to as the V-252 during the first season before assuming the name Venom in the second season. In this series, Horizon High headmaster [[Max Modell]] acquires the symbiote from the space program in hopes of discovering a new element for the periodic table. The V-252 first appeared in the episode \"A Day in the Life\", in which [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] steals the symbiote as a means to sell it to the black market, but Spider-Man recaptures and returns the V-252 to Horizon High. He briefly merged with Spider-Man from \"Sandman\" and \"Stark Expo\", and Flash Thompson during \"Venom\". In Season 2, the V-252 merges with Eddie Brock in \"Dead Man's Party\" but is incapacitated by an experimental sonic device in \"Venom Returns\". Venom is eventually reawakened by experimentation that ultimately alters his genealogy, enabling him to survive without the need for a host, yet is defeated by Spider-Man shortly after Otto Octavius undoes their body-swap in \"Superior\". Venom is slated to return during season 3, subtitled ''Maximum Venom'', in which he unleashed a new threat upon humanity from his home planet, hinting the appearances of more symbiotes.\n\n=== Film ===\n==== Sam Raimi film series ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Sam Raimi films}}\nThe [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote appears in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this version, instead of brought to Earth in a human spaceship, it came from space after it landed on Earth inside a [[meteorite]]. The symbiote fused with the sleeping [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s suit enhancing his powers, abilities and his anger. A small is studied and analyzed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]]. After being rejected by Parker following the dark influence it had on him at the church when ringing the bell, the alien attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Topher Grace]]). Later, both are killed in an explosion at the climax.\n\n==== Marc Webb films ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Marc Webb films}}\nIn trailers for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', the Venom symbiote appeared briefly among various elements of supervillain technology seen in the [[Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers / The Gentleman]]'s agency. In the final cut of the film the symbiote was replaced by the Rhino's armor as Richard Parker has a strong connection with Oscorp's Special Projects equipment used by many Spider-Man villains. Sony Pictures had plans to create a Spider-Man [[Shared fictional universe|cinematic universe]] with various spin-off films including a ''Venom'' film, but those plans were abandoned following the studio agreement reached with [[Marvel Studios]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Exolons are referenced via the Exolon Monks, who serve [[Ronan the Accuser]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Mike O'Sullivan, Rob Bock, Anthoney Cotilletta, Pat Duke, Mike Fichera, Daron Jensen, Rob London, Chris McCarver, Jacob Rougemont and Stuart Vandal|penciller=Wellinton Alves, Simone Bianchi, Nick Bradshaw, Sal Buscema, John Byrne, Roberto Castro, Paul Catling, Jim Cheung, Gene Colan, Gabriele Dell'Otto, Steve Ditko, Andrea Di Vito, Jack Dudman, Anthony Francisco, Javier Garr\u00f3n, Adi Granov, Bob Hall, Scott Hepburn, Dave Johnson, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Nic Klein, Jos\u00e9 Ladr\u00f6nn, Bob Larkin, Aaron Lopresti, Jorge Lucas, Chris Marrinan, Francesco Mattina, Mike Mayhew, Steve McNiven, Gray Morrow, Rudy Nebres, Ariel Olivetti, Paul Pelletier, George P\u00e9rez, Keith Pollard, Olivier Pron, Joe Quinones and Humberto Ramos|title=Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy|issue=1|date=September 2016|editor=Mark D.

However, in the movie there is no mention that the weapon is a symbiote, because, similar to the Exolons, in its introduction All-Black wasn't intended to be a symbiote before a retcon in the comics, hence why [[Marvel Studios]] has the rights of All-Black.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/11/thor-ragnarok-hela-sword|title=Thor: Ragnarok: What Is Hela's Sword?|publisher=Comic Book|date=13 April 2017|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/20190511175534/http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/11/thor-ragnarok-hela-sword/|archive-date=11 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Sony's Marvel Universe ====\nFollowing the success of reintroducing Spider-Man in film with ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and the expected reception of ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), Sony Pictures stated that they were moving forward with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', written by [[Scott Rosenberg]] and [[Jeff Pinkner]], and directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]], released on October 5, 2018, with [[Tom Hardy]] portraying [[Eddie Brock]] / Venom. While initial reports stated that the film would be separate from the MCU, instead set within its own continuity entitled Sony's Marvel Universe, with no connections to the Spider-Man character, in June 2017, [[Amy Pascal]] revealed in an interview that the film would have connections to ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and the rest of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as an \"adjunct\" film, with [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] possibly reprising his role as Spider-Man in ''Venom'' as well as future spin-off films.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/venom-silver-sable-spider-man-homecoming-movies-connections/|title=Venom & Black Cat Movies Will Be 'Adjuncts' to the MCU's Spider-Man|date=2017-06-18|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}</ref> In the international teaser trailer, the Venom symbiote was seen in a glass capsule, before Venom himself is revealed at the end of the first trailer.

All the clones can be killed, but there is one \"prime clone\" with much more life. Defeating this clone is the only way to win.\n* In the 2000 video game ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', the symbiotes become the more common enemy after the player rescues [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] from Venom and heads back to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. The fastest way to kill these symbiotes is to find a fire-imbued web cartridge. It is revealed at the end of the game, that [[Doctor Octopus]] and Carnage planned to unleash the symbiotes on all of humanity and rule a new world order, but their plan is foiled by Spider-Man and Venom.\n* The symbiote family are major characters in the video game ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]''.\n* Venom appears as the final boss in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.\n* Venom appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game (for Game Boy Advance) as a playable character and the final boss. Carnage also appears and serves as the game's penultimate boss.\n* Venom is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.\n* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, the black-suited Spider-Man is playable for a large portion of the game, until removing the symbiote, which attaches to Eddie Brock instead; Venom then serves as the game's final boss, where he is killed after being impaled on some steel bars, although it is possible that the symbiote survived. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] versions of the game also feature the character [[Shriek (character)|Shriek]], whose powers come from a symbiote in this game which is also black in color. However, the symbiote only covers half of her body,\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', Venom returns to New York. During a fight with Venom, the Symbiote suddenly reproduces and the spawn bonds with Spider-Man creating a replica of the Black Suit, but with considerably more Carnage-like abilities such as projecting bladed tentacles. Over the course of the game, Venom creates symbiote \"seed-pods\" in various locations around the city which absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote ranging from '''Snatcher Symbiotes''' (the small black Symbiotes that drag unsuspecting victims to the \"seed-pods\"), '''Zombie Symbiotes''' (the weak white Symbiotes), '''Berserker Symbiotes''' (the red shiny Symbiotes), '''Grappler Symbiotes''' (black and red versions of the Berserkers), and '''Slasher Symbiotes''' (the white and pink Symbiotes). The Symbiotes even manage to infect [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts resulting in '''Electrolings''' and '''Vulturelings'''. All are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the symbiotes are separated from them.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Man in his symbiote suit is a playable character. [[Madame Web]] had restored the black suit as it provides this world's Peter Parker with additional abilities that he will require to succeed in his mission, while she uses her psychic abilities to prevent the suit attempting to take over his mind. However, Madame Web's abilities do not seem to be absolute, as Ultimate Spider-Man experiences occasional bouts of anger. Also, the Ultimate version of Carnage appears as the final boss in the Ultimate levels where it was granted the ability to reanimate its victims into symbiotic zombie-like creatures thanks to the powers of a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos when S.H.I.E.L.D. are foolishly mixing the fragment with Carnage.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', it is revealed that the brainwashed Anti-Venom is responsible for killing present-day [[Spider-Man]], altering the future of the ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline and prompting [[Spider-Man 2099]] to tamper with the timeline further in order to save his predecessor's life and repair the timestream. In one of their battles, Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus (who in the new timeline was never a villain, but still uses his trademark arms) and game exclusive villain Dr. Walker Sloan (the man from 2099 who tried to alter the timeline) are knocked into a portal and become '''Atrocity''' (vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]), a bloated version of Anti-Venom with tentacles. Both Atrocity and the future Peter Parker are defeated with the time resetting presumably separating Atrocity back into Walker Sloan, Anti-Venom, and Doctor Octopus.\n* Two versions of the black suit appear as an optional costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, based on its appearance in the ''Spider-Man 3'' film, and a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game version of the Symbiote is based on a \"black goo\" recovered from space and that it is bonded with the game's version of the Scorpion. This is an allusion to the comics, where Mac Gargan briefly assumed the role of Venom.\n* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', a version of Venom exists in the secret [[Oscorp]] experiment run in [[Ravencroft]] called \"The Venom Project\", using [[nanites]] as a regenerating body armor. It is used on notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady, which transforms him into Carnage under the direction of [[Donald Menken]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].\n* Symbiote Scientists appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n* Various Symbiote characters are featured in the mobile game ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' with the Symbiote World featured as a level.\n* Various Symbiotes appear in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'': [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]].\n* Symbiotes \"connect together\" in a ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]'' storyline. Besides Mac Gargan and Eddie Brock as Venom and Cletus Kasady's Carnage, there are four new Symbiotes: A green male named '''Carrier''', an orange female named '''Horror''', a teal teethy creature named '''Demolisher''', and a magenta dog-like creature named '''Mutation'''.\n* In ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'', the symbiotes appear which were taken from their home planet by Oscorp. Spider-Man tried to save the symbiotes, but got bonded to them and then they tried to take over the Academy. They failed, but decided to remain on Earth.\n* The Symbiotes appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite]]''. In the game's story, [[Jedah Dohma]] uses the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]] to steal a million souls from Earth and feed them to a Giant Symbiote, planning to strengthen it and use it as a weapon against [[Ultron]] [[Sigma (Mega Man X)|Sigma]]. He gives pieces of the symbiotes to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]][[Umbrella Corp|brella]] to bond the pieces to virus-infected subjects to stabilize them. In a battle against Jedah the heroes are successful, but then he unleashes the creature on the New Metro City. When [[Chris Redfield]] tries attacking it, he accidentally causes part of the symbiote to bond to Spider-Man, forcing the latter to fight against [[Frank West (Dead Rising)|Frank West]] and [[Mike Haggar]] against his will (though the symbiote is removed after Frank causes some car alarms to go off). The creature is unleashed on New Metro City, but is destroyed by the heroes using three of the Infinity Stones. Venom also appears as a playable character via [[downloadable content]].\n* In the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. In the post credit scene [[Norman Osborn]] goes into a secret lab inside his house where it shows his son [[Harry Osborn]], inside a chamber labeled G-35 with black web-like substance attached to his body. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.\n* In the 2014 fighting video game ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', the '''Symbioids''' are symbiotes merged with the [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptioids]].

The Symbiotes bond with their hosts, creating a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bond through which a single entity is created. They also are able to slightly alter their hosts' personalities, and/or memories by influencing their darkest desires and wants, along with amplifying their physical and emotional traits and personality, granting them super-human abilities. The first and most well-known symbiote is [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], who originally attached itself to Spider-Man during the [[Secret Wars|''Secret Wars'']] storyline, but after Spider-Man rejected it, Venom instead attached itself to [[Eddie Brock]], and together they became one of Spider-Man's [[Archenemy|archenemies]]; the Venom symbiote would go on to have numerous other hosts, some of them villains as well, such as [[Mac Gargan]], some heroes, such as [[Flash Thompson]] (who became Agent Venom). Other well-known symbiotes are [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], whose most common host is serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]], and [[Anti-Venom]].\n\nThe symbiotes have appeared in various media. Venom has been the most featured one, apperaing as one of the main antagonists of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and the titular protagonist and [[antihero]] of ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''; the latter also featured other symbiotes, most notably [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], who served as the film's main antagonist.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first appearance(s) of a symbiote occurs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #90, and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #141 (released concurrently in May 1984), in which [[Spider-Man]] brings one home to Earth after the [[Secret Wars]] (''Secret Wars'' #8, which was released months later, details of his first encounter with it). The concept was created by a Marvel Comics reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller\u2019s Brush With Comic History &#124; Comics Should Be Good! | publisher=ComicBookResources.com |date=16 May 2007|access-date=2010-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521201414/https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-extra-randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> with the publisher purchasing the idea for $220.

When the [[Celestials]] began their vast plan to evolve the universe, Knull, seeing that his \"Kingdom\" was being touched, retaliated by constructing All-Black, the first symbiote, and decapitated a Celestial. Then, the other Celestials banished Knull along with the severed Celestial head deeper in the Void. After that, he started using the head with its Cosmic energies as a Forge for the symbiotes, where they got the weaknesses of sound and fire \u2013 the head would later become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep!

However, when a dragon-like composite went to the medieval Earth, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeated it and destroyed the connection between Knull and the symbiotes. Upon Knull's severed connection to the symbiotes, the symbiote hive-mind began to explore notions of honor and nobility as they bonded to benevolent hosts. The symbiotes subsequently rebelled against their god, imprisoning him at the heart of an artificial planet in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] they called Klyntar, which is their species name. Ashamed of their dark past, the symbiotes desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors.<ref name=Ve4/> However, these [[Altruism|altruistic]] goals were imperfect, as the Klyntar symbiotes could be corrupted by hosts with harmful chemical imbalances or problematic personality attributes, turning them into destructive parasites who would spread lies and disinformation about their own kind in order to make other peoples fear and hate the Klyntar species as a whole.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller = Valerio Schiti|inker = Valerio Schiti|title = Guardians of the Galaxy|volume = 3|issue = #23|date = 21 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a spacefaring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking whole planets and reestablishing the Imperium.

It used Richard's Rna as the starting base for it, thus himself and [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]] are \"related\" to it. When bonding to a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, casing, similar to a [[pupa]]. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration. When worn by a host other than Richard's son Peter, the host is compelled to take the life energy of other human beings or else have their own be consumed by the suit instead. The original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos|colorist=Transparency Digital|letterer=VC's Chris Eliopoulos|editor=Ralph Macchio, Brian Smith, [[C.B.

Like the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]] and [[Mephisto (comics)#Universe X|Mephisto]], the symbiotes eventually reached the third stage of metamorphosis and apotheosized into metaphysical entities given physical form by what others believed them to be and required of them.<ref>''Earth X'' #X.

In the conclusion of [[The Alien Costume]], Venom is defeated by Spider-Man and sent into space, however [[Dormammu]] and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the rocket allowing Venom back to Earth. When Venom fails to get a [[Stark Industries]] portal device for Mordo, they bond Venom's offspring who Cletus Kasady coins Carnage and send him to help Venom. With help from [[Iron Man]], Eddie Brock willingly separates from Venom, after having a change of heart. When Carnage kidnaps [[Ashley Kafka]] who Eddie is in love with Eddie rejoins with the symbiote and helps Spider-Man, Iron Man and [[War Machine (comics)|War Machine]]. When Carnage attempts to throw Kafka into limbo the place between portals Venom stops him and knocks them both into limbo, foiling Dormannu's plans for good. During the [[Spider Wars]] season finale, Carnage bonds with an alternate dejected Spider-Man to create [[Spider Carnage]].\n* In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage are primary villains, who in the pilot episode board a shuttle piloted by [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] for [[Counter-Earth]] to start a new empire of Symbiotes. Here the symbiotes are more [[amorphous]] creatures that rely on stretching bodies then webbing, and are more exaggerated such as Carnage sporting spikes. The in-universe explanation is that the Symbiotes have bonded completely with their hosts, although under the Synoptic's guide Venom & Carnage learned their shapeshifting abilities (into liquid, etc.) as Spidey referred to that as \"new powers\". \n* Venom appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. In the episode \"The Uncertainly Principle\", the Symbiote arrives on Earth by stowing away on the [[space shuttle]]. After being rejected by Spider-Man, it bonds with Eddie in the episode \"Intervention\", and is ultimately defeated in the episode \"Nature vs. Nurture\". Venom reappeared in the Season Two episodes \"First Steps\", \"Growing Pains\", and \"Identity Crisis\", where he attempts to expose Spider-Man's secret identity but his plans are foiled. Carnage was also set to appear in the third season.\n* The Venom, Carnage, and Anti-Venom Symbiotes appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Venom and Anti-Venom are created by Doctor Octopus for [[Oscorp]]. Venom was created by altering a sample of Spider-Man's DNA and Anti-Venom was created from the Venom sample used to counter and destroy the Venom Symbiote. The Carnage symbiote is created by Green Goblin and later recreated by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] from the Venom symbiote he obtained.\n* In the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"The Venom Within,\" Doctor Octopus creates \"Gamma Venom\" by having the Venom Symbiote combine with each members of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. This version of the Venom Symbiote is destroyed by the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Spider-Man.\n* The Symbiotes appear in the animated ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' series that debuted in 2015. Their origins revealed in the three-part \"Symbiote War\" as originally Klyntar who were altered by [[Thanos]] in his experiments on the mining planet later revealed to be what remained of Groot's homeworld. The Exolons are also referenced inhabiting [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]]'s body.\n* The Venom Symbiote appears in the animated ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, referred to as the V-252 during the first season before assuming the name Venom in the second season. In this series, Horizon High headmaster [[Max Modell]] acquires the symbiote from the space program in hopes of discovering a new element for the periodic table. The V-252 first appeared in the episode \"A Day in the Life\", in which [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] steals the symbiote as a means to sell it to the black market, but Spider-Man recaptures and returns the V-252 to Horizon High. He briefly merged with Spider-Man from \"Sandman\" and \"Stark Expo\", and Flash Thompson during \"Venom\". In Season 2, the V-252 merges with Eddie Brock in \"Dead Man's Party\" but is incapacitated by an experimental sonic device in \"Venom Returns\". Venom is eventually reawakened by experimentation that ultimately alters his genealogy, enabling him to survive without the need for a host, yet is defeated by Spider-Man shortly after Otto Octavius undoes their body-swap in \"Superior\". Venom is slated to return during season 3, subtitled ''Maximum Venom'', in which he unleashed a new threat upon humanity from his home planet, hinting the appearances of more symbiotes.\n\n=== Film ===\n==== Sam Raimi film series ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Sam Raimi films}}\nThe [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote appears in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this version, instead of brought to Earth in a human spaceship, it came from space after it landed on Earth inside a [[meteorite]]. The symbiote fused with the sleeping [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s suit enhancing his powers, abilities and his anger. A small is studied and analyzed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]]. After being rejected by Parker following the dark influence it had on him at the church when ringing the bell, the alien attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Topher Grace]]). Later, both are killed in an explosion at the climax.\n\n==== Marc Webb films ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Marc Webb films}}\nIn trailers for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', the Venom symbiote appeared briefly among various elements of supervillain technology seen in the [[Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers / The Gentleman]]'s agency. In the final cut of the film the symbiote was replaced by the Rhino's armor as Richard Parker has a strong connection with Oscorp's Special Projects equipment used by many Spider-Man villains. Sony Pictures had plans to create a Spider-Man [[Shared fictional universe|cinematic universe]] with various spin-off films including a ''Venom'' film, but those plans were abandoned following the studio agreement reached with [[Marvel Studios]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Exolons are referenced via the Exolon Monks, who serve [[Ronan the Accuser]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Mike O'Sullivan, Rob Bock, Anthoney Cotilletta, Pat Duke, Mike Fichera, Daron Jensen, Rob London, Chris McCarver, Jacob Rougemont and Stuart Vandal|penciller=Wellinton Alves, Simone Bianchi, Nick Bradshaw, Sal Buscema, John Byrne, Roberto Castro, Paul Catling, Jim Cheung, Gene Colan, Gabriele Dell'Otto, Steve Ditko, Andrea Di Vito, Jack Dudman, Anthony Francisco, Javier Garr\u00f3n, Adi Granov, Bob Hall, Scott Hepburn, Dave Johnson, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Nic Klein, Jos\u00e9 Ladr\u00f6nn, Bob Larkin, Aaron Lopresti, Jorge Lucas, Chris Marrinan, Francesco Mattina, Mike Mayhew, Steve McNiven, Gray Morrow, Rudy Nebres, Ariel Olivetti, Paul Pelletier, George P\u00e9rez, Keith Pollard, Olivier Pron, Joe Quinones and Humberto Ramos|title=Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy|issue=1|date=September 2016|editor=Mark D.

However, in the movie there is no mention that the weapon is a symbiote, because, similar to the Exolons, in its introduction All-Black wasn't intended to be a symbiote before a retcon in the comics, hence why [[Marvel Studios]] has the rights of All-Black.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/11/thor-ragnarok-hela-sword|title=Thor: Ragnarok: What Is Hela's Sword?|publisher=Comic Book|date=13 April 2017|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/20190511175534/http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/04/11/thor-ragnarok-hela-sword/|archive-date=11 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Sony's Marvel Universe ====\nFollowing the success of reintroducing Spider-Man in film with ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and the expected reception of ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), Sony Pictures stated that they were moving forward with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', written by [[Scott Rosenberg]] and [[Jeff Pinkner]], and directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]], released on October 5, 2018, with [[Tom Hardy]] portraying [[Eddie Brock]] / Venom. While initial reports stated that the film would be separate from the MCU, instead set within its own continuity entitled Sony's Marvel Universe, with no connections to the Spider-Man character, in June 2017, [[Amy Pascal]] revealed in an interview that the film would have connections to ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and the rest of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as an \"adjunct\" film, with [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] possibly reprising his role as Spider-Man in ''Venom'' as well as future spin-off films.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/venom-silver-sable-spider-man-homecoming-movies-connections/|title=Venom & Black Cat Movies Will Be 'Adjuncts' to the MCU's Spider-Man|date=2017-06-18|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}</ref> In the international teaser trailer, the Venom symbiote was seen in a glass capsule, before Venom himself is revealed at the end of the first trailer.

All the clones can be killed, but there is one \"prime clone\" with much more life. Defeating this clone is the only way to win.\n* In the 2000 video game ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', the symbiotes become the more common enemy after the player rescues [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] from Venom and heads back to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. The fastest way to kill these symbiotes is to find a fire-imbued web cartridge. It is revealed at the end of the game, that [[Doctor Octopus]] and Carnage planned to unleash the symbiotes on all of humanity and rule a new world order, but their plan is foiled by Spider-Man and Venom.\n* The symbiote family are major characters in the video game ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]''.\n* Venom appears as the final boss in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.\n* Venom appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game (for Game Boy Advance) as a playable character and the final boss. Carnage also appears and serves as the game's penultimate boss.\n* Venom is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.\n* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, the black-suited Spider-Man is playable for a large portion of the game, until removing the symbiote, which attaches to Eddie Brock instead; Venom then serves as the game's final boss, where he is killed after being impaled on some steel bars, although it is possible that the symbiote survived. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] versions of the game also feature the character [[Shriek (character)|Shriek]], whose powers come from a symbiote in this game which is also black in color. However, the symbiote only covers half of her body,\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', Venom returns to New York. During a fight with Venom, the Symbiote suddenly reproduces and the spawn bonds with Spider-Man creating a replica of the Black Suit, but with considerably more Carnage-like abilities such as projecting bladed tentacles. Over the course of the game, Venom creates symbiote \"seed-pods\" in various locations around the city which absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote ranging from '''Snatcher Symbiotes''' (the small black Symbiotes that drag unsuspecting victims to the \"seed-pods\"), '''Zombie Symbiotes''' (the weak white Symbiotes), '''Berserker Symbiotes''' (the red shiny Symbiotes), '''Grappler Symbiotes''' (black and red versions of the Berserkers), and '''Slasher Symbiotes''' (the white and pink Symbiotes). The Symbiotes even manage to infect [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts resulting in '''Electrolings''' and '''Vulturelings'''. All are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the symbiotes are separated from them.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Man in his symbiote suit is a playable character. [[Madame Web]] had restored the black suit as it provides this world's Peter Parker with additional abilities that he will require to succeed in his mission, while she uses her psychic abilities to prevent the suit attempting to take over his mind. However, Madame Web's abilities do not seem to be absolute, as Ultimate Spider-Man experiences occasional bouts of anger. Also, the Ultimate version of Carnage appears as the final boss in the Ultimate levels where it was granted the ability to reanimate its victims into symbiotic zombie-like creatures thanks to the powers of a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos when S.H.I.E.L.D. are foolishly mixing the fragment with Carnage.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', it is revealed that the brainwashed Anti-Venom is responsible for killing present-day [[Spider-Man]], altering the future of the ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline and prompting [[Spider-Man 2099]] to tamper with the timeline further in order to save his predecessor's life and repair the timestream. In one of their battles, Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus (who in the new timeline was never a villain, but still uses his trademark arms) and game exclusive villain Dr. Walker Sloan (the man from 2099 who tried to alter the timeline) are knocked into a portal and become '''Atrocity''' (vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]), a bloated version of Anti-Venom with tentacles. Both Atrocity and the future Peter Parker are defeated with the time resetting presumably separating Atrocity back into Walker Sloan, Anti-Venom, and Doctor Octopus.\n* Two versions of the black suit appear as an optional costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, based on its appearance in the ''Spider-Man 3'' film, and a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game version of the Symbiote is based on a \"black goo\" recovered from space and that it is bonded with the game's version of the Scorpion. This is an allusion to the comics, where Mac Gargan briefly assumed the role of Venom.\n* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', a version of Venom exists in the secret [[Oscorp]] experiment run in [[Ravencroft]] called \"The Venom Project\", using [[nanites]] as a regenerating body armor. It is used on notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady, which transforms him into Carnage under the direction of [[Donald Menken]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].\n* Symbiote Scientists appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n* Various Symbiote characters are featured in the mobile game ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' with the Symbiote World featured as a level.\n* Various Symbiotes appear in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'': [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]].\n* Symbiotes \"connect together\" in a ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]'' storyline. Besides Mac Gargan and Eddie Brock as Venom and Cletus Kasady's Carnage, there are four new Symbiotes: A green male named '''Carrier''', an orange female named '''Horror''', a teal teethy creature named '''Demolisher''', and a magenta dog-like creature named '''Mutation'''.\n* In ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'', the symbiotes appear which were taken from their home planet by Oscorp. Spider-Man tried to save the symbiotes, but got bonded to them and then they tried to take over the Academy. They failed, but decided to remain on Earth.\n* The Symbiotes appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite]]''. In the game's story, [[Jedah Dohma]] uses the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]] to steal a million souls from Earth and feed them to a Giant Symbiote, planning to strengthen it and use it as a weapon against [[Ultron]] [[Sigma (Mega Man X)|Sigma]]. He gives pieces of the symbiotes to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]][[Umbrella Corp|brella]] to bond the pieces to virus-infected subjects to stabilize them. In a battle against Jedah the heroes are successful, but then he unleashes the creature on the New Metro City. When [[Chris Redfield]] tries attacking it, he accidentally causes part of the symbiote to bond to Spider-Man, forcing the latter to fight against [[Frank West (Dead Rising)|Frank West]] and [[Mike Haggar]] against his will (though the symbiote is removed after Frank causes some car alarms to go off). The creature is unleashed on New Metro City, but is destroyed by the heroes using three of the Infinity Stones. Venom also appears as a playable character via [[downloadable content]].\n* In the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. In the post credit scene [[Norman Osborn]] goes into a secret lab inside his house where it shows his son [[Harry Osborn]], inside a chamber labeled G-35 with black web-like substance attached to his body. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.\n* In the 2014 fighting video game ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', the '''Symbioids''' are symbiotes merged with the [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptioids]]. Venom, Carnage and Agent Venom appear as playable characters. Also featured are also '''VenomPool''' (amalgamation of [[Deadpool]] and Venom), '''Venom the Duck''' (amalgamation of [[Howard the Duck]] and Venom) and '''Symbiote Supreme''' (amalgamation of [[Doctor Strange]] and Venom).\n\n=== Attractions ===\n* [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] appears as one of the villains in [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' ride.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.thevenomsite.com List of Venom Comics] at TheVenomSite.com\n*{{Marveldatabase|Klyntar_(Race)|Klyntar}}\n*[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/symbiotes/4060-56880/characters/ Symbiotes] at Comic Vine\n*[https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked Marvel's most powerful symbiotes] at IGN\n*[https://screenrant.com/symbiotes-stronger-weaker-venom/ 16 Symbiotes More Powerful Than Venom (And 9 Weaker)] at Screenrant\n*[https://m.ranker.com/list/the-real-comic-book-origin-of-venom/stephanroget The Real Origin Story Of The Venom Symbiote Is Much More Complicated Than You Think] at Ranker\n\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Related topics to Symbiotes\n|list1=\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Eddie Brock}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Guardians of the Galaxy}}\n{{Galactus}}\n{{Marvel Comics deities}}\n{{Avengers}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Venom (Marvel Comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional parasites and parasitoids]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roger Stern]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Zeck]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics alien species]]\n[[Category:Hive minds in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n", "name_user": "JackofOz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFictional history:Gerry Duggan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)"}
