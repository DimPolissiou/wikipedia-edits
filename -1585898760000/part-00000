It is the [[official language]] of Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of [[Hungarians]] in the countries that today make up [[Slovakia]], western [[Ukraine]] ([[Zakarpattia Oblast|Subcarpathia]]), central and western [[Romania]] ([[Transylvania]]), northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), northern [[Croatia]] and northeastern [[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje|Mur region]]).\n\nIt is also spoken by Hungarian [[diaspora]] communities worldwide, especially in North America (particularly the [[Hungarian Americans|United States]] and [[Canada]]) and [[Israel]]. With 13 million speakers, it is the Uralic family's largest member by number of speakers.\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|Regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and other Uralic languages}}\nHungarian is a member of the [[Uralic language family]]. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to the [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] branch within the Finno-Ugric group, along with the [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]] languages of western [[Siberia]] ([[Khanty\u2013Mansia]] region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehtinen|first=Tapani|year=2007|title=Kielen vuosituhannet |series=Tietolipas|volume=215|publisher=[[Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura]]|isbn=978-951-746-896-1}}</ref><ref name=Janhunen2009>{{cite book|last=Janhunen|first=Juha|chapter=Proto-Uralic\u2014what, where and when? |year=2009 |editor= Jussi Ylikoski |title=The Quasquicentennial of the Finno-Ugrian Society |series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia 258 |location=Helsinki |publisher=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Finno-Ougrienne |isbn=978-952-5667-11-0|issn=0355-0230|chapter-url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust258/sust258_janhunen.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Kulonen>{{cite book|first=Ulla-Maija|last=Kulonen|chapter=Kielitiede ja suomen v\u00e4est\u00f6n juuret|editor-first=Riho|editor-last=Gr\u00fcnthal|title=Ennen, muinoin.

On p. 37 he states: \u201cThis seemed to be an impeccable conclusion until attention was paid to the actual testimony of tree-pollen analyses, and these showed that the linguists had failed to take into account changes in the vegetation zones over the millennia. After analysis of the plant pollens in the supposed homeland of the Magyars, which were preserved in the soil, it became clear to scientists that the [[taiga]] and [[deciduous forest]]s were only in contact during the second millennium B.C.E., which is much too late to affect Finno-Ugrian history. So the territory sought by the linguists as the location of the putative \u2018ancient homeland\u2019 never existed. At 5,000-6,000 B.C.E., the period at which the Uralic era has been dated, the taiga was still thousands of kilometres away from the Ural mountains and the mixed deciduous forest had only just begun its northward advance.\u201d</ref>\n\nThere have been attempts to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[English language|English]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Magar language|Magar]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and at least 40 other languages.<ref name=\"zsirai\">Mikl\u00f3s Zsirai: ''\u0150st\u00f6rt\u00e9neti csodabogarak''.

During the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian, or, alternatively, that both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a [[superfamily (linguistics)|superfamily]] of [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages]]. Following an academic debate known as ''Az ugor-t\u00f6r\u00f6k h\u00e1bor\u00fa'' (\"the Ugric-Turkic war\"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, mainly based on work by the German linguist {{Interlanguage link|Josef Budenz|de}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Linguistica Uralica|issue=2/2001|author1-first=Angela|author1-last=Marcantonio|author2-first=Pirjo|author2-last=Nummenaho|author3-first=Michela|author3-last=Salvagni|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va_lu/l37-2-1.pdf|title=The \"Ugric-Turkic Battle\": A Critical Review|accessdate=8 October 2017|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nHungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned [[animal husbandry]] techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash people]], as a high proportion of words specific to agriculture and livestock are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian [[burial]] customs.\n\n===Old Hungarian===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nThe first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly personal names and place names, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in [[Old Hungarian script]] have survived, as wood, the medium of writing in use at the time, was perishable.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was founded in 1000 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. The country became a [[Western culture|Western]]-styled Christian ([[Roman Catholic]]) state, with [[Latin script]] replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the [[establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] from 1055, intermingled with Latin text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], which dates to the 1190s. Although the [[orthography]] of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.}\n\nA more extensive body of [[Hungarian literature]] arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian [[Christian poetry|religious poetry]] is the 14th-century ''[[Lamentations of Mary]]''. The first [[Bible translation]] was the [[Hussite Bible]] in the 1430s.<ref name=\"Kiss2014\">{{cite book|author=Katalin \u00c9 Kiss|title=The Evolution of Functional Left Peripheries in Hungarian Syntax|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExRCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT76|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-870985-5|page=76}}</ref><ref name=\"KaplanBaldauf2005\">{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

German, Italian and French loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman rule]] (1541 to 1699).\n\nIn the 18th century a group of writers, most notably [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], spearheaded a process of ''nyelv\u00faj\u00edt\u00e1s'' ([[language revitalization]]). Some words were shortened (''gy\u0151zedelem'' > ''gy\u0151zelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (''e.g.'', ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''d\u00edsz'', 'd\u00e9cor'); a wide range of expressions were [[neologism|coined]] using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw further [[language standardization|standardization]] of the language, and differences between [[mutually comprehensible]] dialects gradually diminished.\n\nIn 1920, Hungary signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]], losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.\n\nToday the language holds [[official language|official status]] nationally in Hungary and regionally in [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Hungarian language in Transylvania.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Areas of [[Transylvania]] where Hungarian has co-official status (areas in which at least 20% of the population is Hungarian)]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Country!!Speakers!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Hungary]]||align=\"right\"| 9,896,333 ||2011<ref name=\"Hungarian census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/nepszamlalas/tablak_teruleti_00|title=K\u00f6zponti Statisztikai Hivatal|website=Ksh.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n|[[Romania]] <small>(mainly [[Transylvania]])</small>||align=\"right\"| 1,268,444 ||2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TS5.pdf|title=Romanian census 2011|website=Recensamantromania.ro|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Slovakia]]<ref group=\"note\">This number is a lower estimate, as 382,493 people (7.0% of the total population) did not specify their mother tongue.</ref>||align=\"right\"|458,467|| 2011<ref>[http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 Slovak census 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114081722/http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 |date=2012-11-14 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Serbia]] <small>(mainly [[Vojvodina]])</small>||align=\"right\"|241,164|| 2011<ref>[[Languages of Vojvodina]]</ref>{{br}}{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}\n|-\n|[[Ukraine]] <small>(mainly [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])</small>||align=\"right\"|149,400 ||2001<ref>[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ Ukrainian census 2001]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820175518/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ |date=August 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[United States]]||align=\"right\"|117,973 ||2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP16&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212214529/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP16&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U|archive-date=12 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Canada]]||align=\"right\"|75,555 ||2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55670&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55430&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title=File Not Found|website=12.statcan.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Israel]]||align=\"right\"|70,000||\n|-\n|[[Austria]] <small>(mainly [[Burgenland]])</small>||align=\"right\"|22,000||\n|-\n|[[Australia]]||align=\"right\"|20,883||2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/censusexplorer/|title=SBS Census Explorer|website=Sbs.com.au|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Croatia]]||align=\"right\"|16,500||\n|-\n|[[Slovenia]] <small>(mainly [[Prekmurje]])</small>||align=\"right\"|9,240||\n|-\n!Total||12\u201313 million||\n|}\n:''Source: National censuses, [[Ethnologue]]''\n\nHungarian has about 13 million<ref name=Ethnologue>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hun|title=Hungarian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpNOCLJImNkC&pg=PA9 |title=Hungarian Practical Dictionary: Hungarian-English, English-Hungarian |last=Szab\u00f3 |first=\u00c9va |date=2005 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |location=New York |pages=9 |language=en|isbn=9780781810685 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ox89vJtDfMYC&pg=PA1 |title=Hungarian-English/English-Hungarian: Dictionary & Phrasebook |last=Ward |first=Judit Hajnal |date=2002 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |pages=1|isbn=9780781809191 }}</ref> native speakers, of whom more than 9.8 million live in Hungary.

Most consonant phonemes can occur as [[Consonant length|geminates]].\n\nThe sound [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|/\u025f/}}, written {{angle bracket|gy}}, sounds similar to 'd' in [[British English]] 'duty'. It occurs in the name of the country, \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g\" (Hungary), pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0252\u025f\u0252rorsa\u02d0\u0261/}}. It is one of three [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] consonants, the others being {{angle bracket|ty}} and {{angle bracket|ny}}. Historically a fourth palatalized consonant {{IPA link|\u028e}} existed, still written {{angle bracket|ly}}.\n\nA single 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar tap]] (''akkora'' 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] (''akkorra'' 'by that time'), like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\n===Prosody===\nPrimary stress is always on the first [[syllable]] of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: ''viszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra'' (\"goodbye\") is pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8visont\u02ccla\u02d0ta\u02d0\u0283r\u0252/}}. Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main article |Hungarian grammar}}\nHungarian is an [[agglutinative language]]. It uses various [[affixes]], mainly [[suffixes]] but also some [[prefixes]] and a [[circumfix]], to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.\n\n===Vowel harmony===\nHungarian uses [[vowel harmony]] to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns have 18 [[Grammatical case|cases]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Both|first=Csaba Attila|date=2015|title=Noun Cases of Hungarian Language in Romanian|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/ausp/6/3/article-p295.xml|journal=Philologica|volume=6|pages=297|via=Sciendo}}</ref> which are formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (''az alma'' 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix ''\u2013t'' (''az alm\u00e1t'' '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending \u2013''b\u00f3l''/''\u2013b\u0151l'' meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.\n\nPossession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as in English (Peter's apple becomes ''P\u00e9ter alm\u00e1ja'', literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with''\u2013k'' (''az alm\u00e1k'' \u2018the apples\u2019), but after a numeral, the singular is used (''k\u00e9t alma'' \u2018two apples\u2019, literally \u2018two apple\u2019; not ''*k\u00e9t alm\u00e1k'').\n\nUnlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and nearly always [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]] instead of prepositions.\n\nThere are two types of [[article (grammar)|articles]] in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives precede nouns (''a piros alma'' 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (''piros'' 'red'), comparative (''pirosabb'' 'redder') and superlative (''a legpirosabb'' 'the reddest').\n\nIf the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: ''a piros alm\u00e1k'' 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun:  ''az alm\u00e1k piros'''ak''''' 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): ''Melyik alm\u00e1t k\u00e9red?&nbsp;\u2013 A piros'''at'''.'' 'Which apple would you like?&nbsp;\u2013 The red one'.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{See also|Hungarian verbs}}\n\n===Word order===\nThe neutral word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). However, Hungarian is a [[topic-prominent language]], and so has a [[word order]] that depends not only on syntax but also on the [[topic\u2013comment]] structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).\n\nA Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.\n\nThe topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in \"''Az alm\u00e1t J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja\".'' ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.\n\nThe focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, \"\u00c9n vagyok az ap\u00e1d\". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the pronoun I (''\u00e9n'') is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.\n\nAlthough Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.\n*J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja az alm\u00e1t. - 'John sees the apple'. Neutral sentence.\n*''J\u00e1nos'' '''l\u00e1tja''' az alm\u00e1t. - 'John '''sees''' the apple'. (Peter may not see the apple.)\n*'''J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja az ''alm\u00e1t''. - 'It is John who sees the apple'. (The listener may have thought that it is Peter.)\n*''J\u00e1nos''''' az alm\u00e1t '''l\u00e1tja. - 'What John sees is the apple'. (It is the apple, not the pear, that John specifically sees. However, Peter may see the pear.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' l\u00e1tja''' J\u00e1nos. - 'It is the apple that is seen by John'. (The pear may not be seen by John, but it may be smelled, for example.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja. - 'It is by John that the apple is seen'. (It is not seen by Peter, but the pear may be seen by Peter, for example.)\n\n==Politeness==\n{{Main article|T\u2013V distinction#Hungarian}}\n\nHungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n\n*''\u00d6n'' (''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here \"you\", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.\n*''Maga'' (''mag\u00e1z\u00e1s'', ''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as ''maga''. Aside from the different [[pronoun]] it is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\".\n*''N\u00e9ni/b\u00e1csi'' (''tetszikez\u00e9s''): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\" or \"''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''\", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role \"''tetszik''\" (\"like\") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parents, close friends or close relatives by using \"''tetszik''\" (\"you like\"): \"''Hogy vagy?''\" (\"How are you?\") here becomes \"''Hogy tetszik lenni?''\" (\"How do you like to be?\"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.\n*''Te'' (''tegez\u00e9s'', ''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s'' or ''pertu'', [[per tu]] from [[Latin]]): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address [[God]]. The highest rank, the [[king]], was traditionally addressed \"per tu\" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and by adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without [[T\u2013V distinction]] [[thou|in most contemporary dialects]]) on the Internet, \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.\n\nThe four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s''\".\n\nSome anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the ''te'' (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop [[IKEA]], whose web site and other publications address the customers in ''te'' form. When a news site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanizsaujsag.hu/hirek/8351/miert-tegezik-a-magyarokat-a-multik/|title=Mi\u00e9rt tegezik a magyarokat a multik? - Kanizsa \u00dajs\u00e1g|first=Kanizsa|last=Ujsag|website=Kanizsaujsag.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> asked IKEA\u2014using the ''te'' form\u2014why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer\u2014using the ''\u00f6n'' form\u2014that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France uses the polite (''vous'') form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers. Telenor chose to communicate towards business customers in the polite ''\u00f6n'' form while all other customers are addressed in the less polite ''te'' form.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ Examples with '''''ad'''''\n!

Kazinczy's chief goal was to replace existing words of German and Latin origins with newly-created Hungarian words. As a result, Kazinczy and his later followers (the reformers) significantly reduced the formerly high ratio of words of Latin and German origins in the Hungarian language, which were related to social sciences, natural sciences, politics and economics, institutional names, fashion etc.\nGiving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define \"a word\" in [[agglutination|agglutinating]] languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To obtain a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements.

(See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.\n\nThe basic vocabulary shares several hundred word roots with other [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]]. Examples are the verb ''\u00e9l'' \"live\" (Finnish ''el\u00e4\u00e4''<ref name=Helsinki>{{cite web|title=\"Related words\" in Finnish and Hungarian|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html|publisher=Helsinki University Bulletin|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>), the numbers ''kett\u0151'' (2), ''h\u00e1rom'' (3), ''n\u00e9gy'' (4) (cf.

Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers & gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship & religion were, too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~lukacs/DETREHUN.htm|title=PROTO-MAGYAR TEXTS FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1st MILLENIUM<!--sic-->?|website=Rmki.kfki.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n| width = 300px\n| title = Origin of word roots in modern Hungarian<ref name=\"kenesei-p134\">''A nyelv \u00e9s a nyelvek'' (\"Language and languages\"), edited by Istv\u00e1n Kenesei.

There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.\n\nAnother source<ref name=\"Halukinen-p307\">''The Structure and Development of the Finnish Language'', The Uralic and Altaic Series: 1960\u20131993 V.1-150, By Denis Sinor, John R.

Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.\n\n===Word formation===\nWords can be compounds or derived.  Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.\n\n====Compounds====\nCompounds have been present in the language since the [[Proto-Uralic]] era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.\n\nA good example is the word ''arc'':\n\n:: ''orr'' (nose) + ''sz\u00e1j'' (mouth) \u2192 ''orca'' (face) (colloquial until the end of the 19th century and still in use in some dialects) > ''arc'' (face)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetismeret.hu/?id=3.2 |title=It's written in chapter Testr\u00e9szek |publisher=Nemzetismeret.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>\n\nCompounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be ''subordinative'': <!-- subordinative is \"al\u00e1rendel\u0151\" in Hungarian; it was rather coined by me. I can't find *ANY* reference on this in English. If you can, please translate al\u00e1rendel\u0151 properly. Other \"Hunglish\" words include subjective, objective, determinative, adjunctive and coordinative. --> the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a [[subjective case|subjective]] one. There are [[objective case|objective]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determinative]], and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]ive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:\n\n: Subjective:\n:: ''menny'' (heaven) + ''d\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (rumble) \u2192 ''mennyd\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (thundering)\n:: ''Nap'' (Sun) + ''s\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (lit by) \u2192 ''naps\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (sunlit)\n: Objective:\n:: ''fa'' (tree, wood) + ''v\u00e1g\u00f3'' (cutter) \u2192 ''fav\u00e1g\u00f3'' (lumberjack, literally \"woodcutter\")\n: Determinative:\n:: ''\u00faj'' (new) + ''j\u00e1'' (modification of ''-v\u00e1, -v\u00e9'' a suffix meaning \"making it to something\")  + ''\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (construction) \u2192 ''\u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (reconstruction, literally \"making something to be new by construction\")\n: Adjunctive:\n:: ''s\u00e1rga'' (yellow) + ''r\u00e9z'' (copper) \u2192 ''s\u00e1rgar\u00e9z'' (brass)\n\nAccording to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more [[syllables]] long  (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.\n\nOther compound words are ''coordinatives'': there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include [[reduplication]] (to emphasise the meaning; ''olykor-olykor''\n'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: ''gizgaz'', where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix ''giz'' is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, ''hercehurca'' 'complex, obsolete procedures').\n\nA compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:\n\n: ''elme'' [mind; standalone base] + (''gy\u00f3gy'' [medical] + ''int\u00e9zet'' [institute]) \u2192 ''elmegy\u00f3gyint\u00e9zet'' ([[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]])\n: (''hadi'' [militarian] + ''fogoly'' [prisoner]) + (''munka'' [work] + ''t\u00e1bor'' [camp]) \u2192 ''hadifogoly-munkat\u00e1bor'' (work camp of prisoners of war)\n\n===Noteworthy lexical items===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n====Points of the compass====\nHungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the Sun during the day in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n*North = \u00e9szak (from \"\u00e9j(szaka)\", 'night'), as the Sun never shines from the North\n*South = d\u00e9l ('noon'), as the Sun shines from the South at noon\n*East = kelet ('rise'), as the Sun rises in the East\n*West = nyugat ('set'), as the Sun sets in the West\n\n====Two words for \"red\"====\n<!-- Must this \"red\" issue really be this long? -->\n\nThere are two basic words for \"red\" in Hungarian: \"piros\" and \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" (variant: \"veres\"; compare with Estonian \"verev\" or Finnish \"punainen\"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English \"scarlet\" is of \"red\".) The word \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" is related to \"v\u00e9r\", meaning \"blood\" (Finnish and Estonian \"veri\"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between \"scarlet\"  and \"red\". While many languages have multiple [[colour name|names for this colour]], often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct \"[[folk colour]]s\".<ref name=\"basiccolor\">Berlin, B and Kay, P (1969). ''Basic Color Terms''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press</ref>\n\nHowever, the two words are also used independently of the above in [[collocation]]s. \"Piros\" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.\n\nWhen the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.\n\nExamples:\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"piros\": a red road sign, red traffic lights, the red line of [[Budapest Metro]], red (now called express) bus lines in Budapest, a holiday shown in red in the calendar, ruddy complexion, the red nose of a clown, some red flowers (those of a neutral nature, e.g. tulips), red peppers and paprika, red card suits (hearts and diamonds), red stripes on a flag (but the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and its variants translate to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\"), etc.\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\": [[Red Sea]], [[Red Square]], [[Red Army]], [[Red Baron]], [[Erik the Red]], [[red wine]], red carpet (for receiving important guests), red hair or beard, red lion (the mythical animal), the [[Red Cross]], the novel ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[redshift]], [[red giant]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[red oak]], some red flowers (those with passionate connotations, e.g. roses), red fox, names of ferric and other red minerals, red copper, rust, red phosphorus, the colour of blushing with anger or shame, the red nose of an alcoholic (in contrast with that of a clown, see above), the red posterior of a baboon, red meat, regular onion (not the red onion, which is \"lila\"), [[litmus paper]] (in acid), cities, countries, or other political entities associated with [[leftist]] movements (e.g. [[Red Vienna]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Red Russia]]), etc.\n\n====Kinship terms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age.

However, the word ''fi\u00fa'' can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word ''(fi\u00faja)'' will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.\n\nThe word ''fi\u00fa'' (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming ''fiai\u00e9i'', adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| fi\u00fa || boy\n|-\n| fia || his/her son\n|-\n| fiai || his/her sons\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9 || his/her son's (singular object)\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9i || his/her son's (plural object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9 || his/her sons' (singular object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9i || his/her sons' (plural object)\n|}\n\n====Extremely long words====\n*''megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek\u00e9rt''\n: Partition to root and suffixes with explanations:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| meg- || verb prefix; in this case, it means \"completed\"\n|-\n| szent || holy (the word root)\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || like English \"-ness\", as in \"holiness\"\n|-\n| -t(e)len || variant of \"-tlen\", noun suffix expressing the lack of something; like English \"-less\", as in \"useless\"\n|-\n| -\u00edt || constitutes a transitive verb from an adjective\n|-\n| -het || expresses possibility; somewhat similar to the English modal verbs \"may\" or \"can\"\n|-\n| -(e)tlen || another variant of \"-tlen\"\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || (see above)\n|-\n| -es || constitutes an adjective from a noun; like English \"-y\" as in \"witty\"\n|-\n| -ked || attached to an adjective (e.g. \"strong\"), produces the verb \"to pretend to be (strong)\" <!-- cf. \"okoskodik\", \"er\u0151sk\u00f6dik\"; the \"-ik\" is dropped due to the further suffixes, thus it is better not to mark it in the table -->\n|-\n| -\u00e9s || constitutes a noun from a verb; there are various ways this is done in English, e.g. \"-ance\" in \"acceptance\"\n|-\n| -eitek || plural possessive suffix, second-person plural (e.g. \"apple\" \u2192 \"your apples\", where \"your\" refers to multiple people)\n|-\n| -\u00e9rt || approximately translates to \"because of\", or in this case simply \"for\"\n|}\n\n: '''Translation:''' \"for your [plural] repeated pretending to be indesecrable\"<!-- the element \"repeated\" comes from -s\u00e9gesked\u00e9s-, which can refer to a constant and annoying habit-->\n\nThe above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:\n\n* ''legeslegmegszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edttethetetlenebbjeitekk\u00e9nt''\n:''leges-leg-meg-'''''szent'''''-s\u00e9g-telen-\u00edt-tet-het-etlen-ebb-je-i-tek-k\u00e9nt''\n:\"like those of you that are the very least possible to get desecrated\"\n\nWords of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see [[agglutinative language]]). They are not compound words\u2014they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root (\"szent\", saint or holy).\nThere is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.\n\n====Hungarian words in English====\nThe English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably ''[[paprika]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''papar'' \"pepper\" and the Hungarian diminutive ''-ka''.  The most common however is ''[[Coach (carriage)|coach]]'', from ''kocsi'', originally ''kocsi szek\u00e9r'' \"car from/in the style of [[Kocs]]\".  Others are:\n\n* [[shako]], from ''cs\u00e1k\u00f3'', from ''cs\u00e1k\u00f3s\u00fcveg'' \"peaked cap\"\n* [[sabre]], from ''szablya''\n* [[wikt:heyduck|heyduck]], from ''hajd\u00fak'', plural of ''hajd\u00fa'' \"brigand\"\n* [[tolpatch]], from ''talpas'' \"foot-soldier\", apparently derived from ''talp'' \"[[sole (foot)|sole]]\".\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main article|Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian orthography|Hungarian Braille}}\n[[File:Tihany 1055.PNG|thumb|The oldest surviving words written in Hungarian, from the founding declaration of the [[Tihany|Benedictine Abbey of Tihany]], 1055. {{br}} It reads \"''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea''\" (in modern Hungarian \"''Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rra men\u0151 hadi \u00fatra''\", meaning \"''to the military road going to [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]''\")]]\n[[File:A 4-es t\u00e1bl\u00e1ja.jpg|thumb|Hungarian language road sign]]\n\n[[File:Codex of munchen - bible in hungarian.jpg|thumb|Medieval Hungarian book (a copy of the [[Hussite Bible]]), 1466]]\n\nThe Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left [[Old Hungarian script|Old Hungarian runes]], superficially similar in appearance to the better-known [[futhark]] runes but unrelated. When [[Stephen I of Hungary]] established the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practised by some enthusiasts.\n\nModern Hungarian is written using an expanded [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents ''(\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa)'' to represent long vowels, and umlauts (''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') and their long counterparts [[Double acute accent|''\u0151'' and ''\u0171'']] to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) {{angle bracket|\u00f4}} or {{angle bracket|\u00f5}} is used for {{angle bracket|\u0151}}, and {{angle bracket|\u00fb}} for {{angle bracket|\u0171}}. This is often due to the limitations of the [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page]]. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page]], but this [[code page]] is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both {{angle bracket|\u0151}} and {{angle bracket|\u0171}}.) [[Unicode]] includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the letter pairs [[Hungarian ny|{{angle bracket|ny}}]], [[Hungarian ty|{{angle bracket|ty}}]], and [[Hungarian gy|{{angle bracket|gy}}]] represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/\u025f/}} (a little like the \"d+y\" sounds in British \"''du''ke\" or American \"woul''d y''ou\")\u2014a bit like saying \"d\" with the tongue pointing to the [[palate]].\n\nHungarian uses {{angle bracket|s}} for {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and [[Hungarian sz|{{angle bracket|sz}}]] for {{IPA|/s/}}, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]] usage. The letter [[Hungarian zs|{{angle bracket|zs}}]] is {{IPA|/\u0292/}} and [[Hungarian cs|{{angle bracket|cs}}]] is {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}. These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter [[Hungarian ly|{{angle bracket|ly}}]] is also a \"single letter digraph\", but is pronounced like {{IPA|/j/}} (English {{angle bracket|y}}), and appears mostly in old words. The letters [[Hungarian dz|{{angle bracket|dz}}]] and [[Hungarian dzs|{{angle bracket|dzs}}]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are ''madzag'' (\"string\"), ''edzeni'' (\"to train (athletically)\") and ''dzsungel'' (\"jungle\").\n\nSometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: h\u00e1zsz\u00e1m (\"street number\") = ''h\u00e1z'' (\"house\") + ''sz\u00e1m'' (\"number\"), not an unintelligible ''h\u00e1zs'' + ''z\u00e1m''.\n\nHungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, ''lenni'' (\"to be\"), ''hozz\u00e1sz\u00f3l\u00e1s'' (\"comment\"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: {{angle bracket|sz}} + {{angle bracket|sz}} = {{angle bracket|ssz}}, e.g. ''m\u0171v\u00e9sszel'' (\"with an artist\"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, (\"with a bus\"):\n:... ''busz-''\n:''szal''...\n\nWhen the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: ''jegy'' + ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' = ''jegygy\u0171r\u0171'' (\"engagement/wedding ring\", ''jegy'' means \"sign\", \"mark\". The term ''jegyben lenni/j\u00e1rni'' means \"to be engaged\"; ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' means \"ring\").\n\nUsually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' (\"eighteen\") is a concatenation of ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling [[minimal pair]]s: ''tol'' (\"push\") vs. ''toll'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\").\n\nWhile to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and \"ly, j\" representing {{IPA|/j/}}).\n\n==Word order==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe [[word order]] is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.\n\n===Name order===\n{{Main article|Hungarian names}}\nThe Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.\n\n====Hungarian names in foreign languages====\nFor clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary&nbsp;\u2013 where there is a [[Treaty of Trianon|significant Hungarian population]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.\n\nFor an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist called the \"father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]\" was '''''Teller Ede''''', but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as '''''[[Edward Teller]]'''''. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses ''[[Andr\u00e1s Schiff]]'' when abroad, not ''Andrew Schiff'' (in Hungarian ''Schiff Andr\u00e1s''). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.\n\n====Foreign names in Hungarian====\nIn modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:\n\n*Amikor ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' Los Angelesben volt, l\u00e1tta ''John Travolt\u00e1t.'' (means: When J\u00e1nos Kiss was in [[Los Angeles]] he saw John Travolta.)\n:The Hungarian name ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' is in the Hungarian name order (''J\u00e1nos'' is equivalent to ''John''), but the foreign name ''John Travolta'' remains in the western name order.\n\nBefore the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also \"Hungarianised\": ''Goethe J\u00e1nos Farkas'' (originally [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including ''Verne Gyula'' ([[Jules Verne]]), ''Marx K\u00e1roly'' ([[Karl Marx]]), ''Kolumbusz Krist\u00f3f'' ([[Christopher Columbus]]; note that the last of these is also translated in English from the original Italian or possibly Ligurian).\n\nSome native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as ''Luther M\u00e1rton'' ([[Martin Luther]]), ''Husz J\u00e1nos'' ([[Jan Hus]]), ''K\u00e1lvin J\u00e1nos'' ([[John Calvin]]); just like the names of monarchs, for example the king of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I]] is referred to as ''I. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1roly'' or the queen of the UK, [[Elizabeth II]] is referred to as ''II. Erzs\u00e9bet''.\n\n[[Japanese names]], which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. ''Kuroszava Akira'' instead of [[Akira Kurosawa]].\n\n====Date and time====\nThe Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)\n\nThe year and day are always written in [[Arabic numerals]], followed by a [[full stop]]. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.\n\nHours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the [[24-hour clock]] format, but in verbal (and written) communication [[12-hour clock]] format can also be used. See below for usage examples.\n\nDate and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.\n\n*2008. febru\u00e1r 9. 16:23:42 ''or'' 2008. febru\u00e1r 9., 16:23:42\n*2008. febr. 9.\n*2008. 02. 09. ''or'' 2008. 2. 9. (rarely)\n*2008. II. 9.\n\nDate separated by [[hyphen]] is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here&nbsp;\u2013 just like the version separated by full stops&nbsp;\u2013 leading zeros are in use.\n\n*2008-02-09\n\nWhen only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only \"displaying\" time), these parts can be separated by a [[full stop]] (e.g. \"Tal\u00e1lkozzunk 10.35-kor.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"Let's meet at 10.35.\"), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in [[superscript]] (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup>35</sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\" ''or'' \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup><u>35</u></sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"The meeting begins at 10.35.\").\n\nAlso, in verbal and written communication it is common to use \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt\" (literally \"before noon\") and \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n\" (lit. \"after noon\") abbreviated as \"de.\" and \"du.\" respectively. D\u00e9lel\u0151tt and d\u00e9lut\u00e1n is said or written before the time, e.g. \"D\u00e9lut\u00e1n 4 \u00f3ra van.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"It's 4 p.m.\". However e.g. \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt 5 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"5 a.m.\") or \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n 10 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"10 p.m.\") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead \"hajnal\" (\"dawn\"), \"reggel\" (\"morning\"), \"este\" (\"evening\") and \"\u00e9jjel\" (\"night\") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says \"Reggel 6-kor ettem.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I had food at ''*morning'' 6.\", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says \"Hajnali 6-kor m\u00e9g aludtam.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I was still sleeping at ''*dawn'' 6.\"). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Expression!!Approximate time\n|-\n|Hajnal||4\u20136 a.m.\n|-\n|Reggel||6\u20139 a.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9lel\u0151tt (de.)||9 a.m.&nbsp;\u2013 12 p.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9l*||=12 p.m. (=\"noon\")\n|-\n|D\u00e9lut\u00e1n (du.)||12\u20136 p.m.\n|-\n|Este||6\u201311 p.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jjel||11 p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 4 a.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jf\u00e9l*||=12 a.m. (=\"midnight\")\n|}\n* * \"D\u00e9l\" and \"\u00e9jf\u00e9l\" mean these exact times, so using time after them is incorrect. So there is '''no''' \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l 0-kor m\u00e9g buliztunk\" (\"We were still partying at ''*midnight 0''.\") or \"D\u00e9l 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\" (\"The sun shines at ''*noon 12''.\"). Instead \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l'''kor''' m\u00e9g buliztunk.\" and \"D\u00e9l'''ben''' s\u00fct a nap.\" is correct. (More confusingly, one can say \"D\u00e9l'''i''' 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\", meaning \"The sun shines at 12 '''of''' noon.\", i.e. \"The sun shines at 12, which is the 12 of daytime.\") \"D\u00e9len s\u00fct a nap\" on the other hand means \"The sun shines in the south\", as D\u00e9l means both noon and south.\n\n==== Addresses ====\n\nAlthough address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:\n\n'''Budapest, De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r 1. 1052'''\n\nSo the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:\n\nName of the recipient<br />\nSettlement<br />\nStreet address (up to door number if necessary)<br />\n(HU-)postcode\n\n==Vocabulary examples==\n''Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word.  The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress.  All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.''\n\n=== Numbers ===\n<small>Source: Wiktionary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Hungarian_cardinal_numbers|title=Category:Hungarian cardinal numbers - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref></small>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

On p. 37 he states: \u201cThis seemed to be an impeccable conclusion until attention was paid to the actual testimony of tree-pollen analyses, and these showed that the linguists had failed to take into account changes in the vegetation zones over the millennia. After analysis of the plant pollens in the supposed homeland of the Magyars, which were preserved in the soil, it became clear to scientists that the [[taiga]] and [[deciduous forest]]s were only in contact during the second millennium B.C.E., which is much too late to affect Finno-Ugrian history. So the territory sought by the linguists as the location of the putative \u2018ancient homeland\u2019 never existed. At 5,000-6,000 B.C.E., the period at which the Uralic era has been dated, the taiga was still thousands of kilometres away from the Ural mountains and the mixed deciduous forest had only just begun its northward advance.\u201d</ref>\n\nThere have been attempts to show that Hungarian is related to other languages, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[English language|English]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Magar language|Magar]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and at least 40 other languages.<ref name=\"zsirai\">Mikl\u00f3s Zsirai: ''\u0150st\u00f6rt\u00e9neti csodabogarak''.

During the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian, or, alternatively, that both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a [[superfamily (linguistics)|superfamily]] of [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages]]. Following an academic debate known as ''Az ugor-t\u00f6r\u00f6k h\u00e1bor\u00fa'' (\"the Ugric-Turkic war\"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, mainly based on work by the German linguist {{Interlanguage link|Josef Budenz|de}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Linguistica Uralica|issue=2/2001|author1-first=Angela|author1-last=Marcantonio|author2-first=Pirjo|author2-last=Nummenaho|author3-first=Michela|author3-last=Salvagni|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va_lu/l37-2-1.pdf|title=The \"Ugric-Turkic Battle\": A Critical Review|accessdate=8 October 2017|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nHungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned [[animal husbandry]] techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash people]], as a high proportion of words specific to agriculture and livestock are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian [[burial]] customs.\n\n===Old Hungarian===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nThe first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly personal names and place names, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in [[Old Hungarian script]] have survived, as wood, the medium of writing in use at the time, was perishable.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was founded in 1000 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. The country became a [[Western culture|Western]]-styled Christian ([[Roman Catholic]]) state, with [[Latin script]] replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the [[establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] from 1055, intermingled with Latin text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], which dates to the 1190s. Although the [[orthography]] of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.}\n\nA more extensive body of [[Hungarian literature]] arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian [[Christian poetry|religious poetry]] is the 14th-century ''[[Lamentations of Mary]]''. The first [[Bible translation]] was the [[Hussite Bible]] in the 1430s.<ref name=\"Kiss2014\">{{cite book|author=Katalin \u00c9 Kiss|title=The Evolution of Functional Left Peripheries in Hungarian Syntax|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExRCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT76|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-870985-5|page=76}}</ref><ref name=\"KaplanBaldauf2005\">{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

German, Italian and French loans also began to appear. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the period of [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman rule]] (1541 to 1699).\n\nIn the 18th century a group of writers, most notably [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], spearheaded a process of ''nyelv\u00faj\u00edt\u00e1s'' ([[language revitalization]]). Some words were shortened (''gy\u0151zedelem'' > ''gy\u0151zelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (''e.g.'', ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''d\u00edsz'', 'd\u00e9cor'); a wide range of expressions were [[neologism|coined]] using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw further [[language standardization|standardization]] of the language, and differences between [[mutually comprehensible]] dialects gradually diminished.\n\nIn 1920, Hungary signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]], losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.\n\nToday the language holds [[official language|official status]] nationally in Hungary and regionally in [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Hungarian language in Transylvania.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Areas of [[Transylvania]] where Hungarian has co-official status (areas in which at least 20% of the population is Hungarian)]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Country!!Speakers!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Hungary]]||align=\"right\"| 9,896,333 ||2011<ref name=\"Hungarian census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/nepszamlalas/tablak_teruleti_00|title=K\u00f6zponti Statisztikai Hivatal|website=Ksh.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n|[[Romania]] <small>(mainly [[Transylvania]])</small>||align=\"right\"| 1,268,444 ||2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TS5.pdf|title=Romanian census 2011|website=Recensamantromania.ro|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Slovakia]]<ref group=\"note\">This number is a lower estimate, as 382,493 people (7.0% of the total population) did not specify their mother tongue.</ref>||align=\"right\"|458,467|| 2011<ref>[http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 Slovak census 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114081722/http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 |date=2012-11-14 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Serbia]] <small>(mainly [[Vojvodina]])</small>||align=\"right\"|241,164|| 2011<ref>[[Languages of Vojvodina]]</ref>{{br}}{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}\n|-\n|[[Ukraine]] <small>(mainly [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])</small>||align=\"right\"|149,400 ||2001<ref>[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ Ukrainian census 2001]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820175518/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ |date=August 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[United States]]||align=\"right\"|117,973 ||2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP16&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212214529/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP16&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U|archive-date=12 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Canada]]||align=\"right\"|75,555 ||2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55670&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55430&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title=File Not Found|website=12.statcan.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Israel]]||align=\"right\"|70,000||\n|-\n|[[Austria]] <small>(mainly [[Burgenland]])</small>||align=\"right\"|22,000||\n|-\n|[[Australia]]||align=\"right\"|20,883||2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/censusexplorer/|title=SBS Census Explorer|website=Sbs.com.au|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Croatia]]||align=\"right\"|16,500||\n|-\n|[[Slovenia]] <small>(mainly [[Prekmurje]])</small>||align=\"right\"|9,240||\n|-\n!Total||12\u201313 million||\n|}\n:''Source: National censuses, [[Ethnologue]]''\n\nHungarian has about 13 million<ref name=Ethnologue>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hun|title=Hungarian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpNOCLJImNkC&pg=PA9 |title=Hungarian Practical Dictionary: Hungarian-English, English-Hungarian |last=Szab\u00f3 |first=\u00c9va |date=2005 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |location=New York |pages=9 |language=en|isbn=9780781810685 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ox89vJtDfMYC&pg=PA1 |title=Hungarian-English/English-Hungarian: Dictionary & Phrasebook |last=Ward |first=Judit Hajnal |date=2002 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |pages=1|isbn=9780781809191 }}</ref> native speakers, of whom more than 9.8 million live in Hungary.

Hungarian is also one of the official languages of [[Vojvodina]] and an official language of three municipalities in [[Slovenia]]: [[Hodo\u0161]], [[Dobrovnik]] and [[Lendava]], along with [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Hungarian is officially recognized as a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]], [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] in [[Ukraine]], and [[Slovakia]]. In [[Romania]] it is a recognized minority language used at local level in communes, towns and municipalities with an ethnic Hungarian population of over 20%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1096369.html|title=Romania: Law Allows Use Of Minority Languages In Public Administration|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\n===Dialects===\n{{main|Hungarian dialects}}\nThe [[dialects]] of Hungarian identified by [[Ethnologue]] are: Alf\u00f6ld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King's Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Sz\u00e9kely and West Hungarian. These dialects are, for the most part, [[mutually intelligible]]. The Hungarian [[Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3]] dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in [[Bac\u0103u County]] in eastern Romania. The Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other [[Hungarian people]], and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Hungarian vowel chart with rounded short a.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Hungarian vowels]]\n{{Main|Hungarian phonology}}\n\nHungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as ''o'' and ''\u00f3''. Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration. However, pairs ''a''/''\u00e1'' and ''e''/''\u00e9'' differ both in closedness and length.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Hungarian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Szende|1994|p=91}}</ref>\n! \n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Postalveolar consonant|Post-{{br}}alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

Most consonant phonemes can occur as [[Consonant length|geminates]].\n\nThe sound [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|/\u025f/}}, written {{angle bracket|gy}}, sounds similar to 'd' in [[British English]] 'duty'. It occurs in the name of the country, \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g\" (Hungary), pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0252\u025f\u0252rorsa\u02d0\u0261/}}. It is one of three [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] consonants, the others being {{angle bracket|ty}} and {{angle bracket|ny}}. Historically a fourth palatalized consonant {{IPA link|\u028e}} existed, still written {{angle bracket|ly}}.\n\nA single 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar tap]] (''akkora'' 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] (''akkorra'' 'by that time'), like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\n===Prosody===\nPrimary stress is always on the first [[syllable]] of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: ''viszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra'' (\"goodbye\") is pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8visont\u02ccla\u02d0ta\u02d0\u0283r\u0252/}}. Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main article |Hungarian grammar}}\nHungarian is an [[agglutinative language]]. It uses various [[affixes]], mainly [[suffixes]] but also some [[prefixes]] and a [[circumfix]], to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.\n\n===Vowel harmony===\nHungarian uses [[vowel harmony]] to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns have 18 [[Grammatical case|cases]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Both|first=Csaba Attila|date=2015|title=Noun Cases of Hungarian Language in Romanian|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/ausp/6/3/article-p295.xml|journal=Philologica|volume=6|pages=297|via=Sciendo}}</ref> which are formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (''az alma'' 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix ''\u2013t'' (''az alm\u00e1t'' '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending \u2013''b\u00f3l''/''\u2013b\u0151l'' meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.\n\nPossession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as in English (Peter's apple becomes ''P\u00e9ter alm\u00e1ja'', literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with''\u2013k'' (''az alm\u00e1k'' \u2018the apples\u2019), but after a numeral, the singular is used (''k\u00e9t alma'' \u2018two apples\u2019, literally \u2018two apple\u2019; not ''*k\u00e9t alm\u00e1k'').\n\nUnlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and nearly always [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]] instead of prepositions.\n\nThere are two types of [[article (grammar)|articles]] in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives precede nouns (''a piros alma'' 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (''piros'' 'red'), comparative (''pirosabb'' 'redder') and superlative (''a legpirosabb'' 'the reddest').\n\nIf the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: ''a piros alm\u00e1k'' 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun:  ''az alm\u00e1k piros'''ak''''' 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): ''Melyik alm\u00e1t k\u00e9red?&nbsp;\u2013 A piros'''at'''.'' 'Which apple would you like?&nbsp;\u2013 The red one'.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{See also|Hungarian verbs}}\n\n===Word order===\nThe neutral word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). However, Hungarian is a [[topic-prominent language]], and so has a [[word order]] that depends not only on syntax but also on the [[topic\u2013comment]] structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).\n\nA Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.\n\nThe topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in \"''Az alm\u00e1t J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja\".'' ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.\n\nThe focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, \"\u00c9n vagyok az ap\u00e1d\". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the pronoun I (''\u00e9n'') is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.\n\nAlthough Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.\n*J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja az alm\u00e1t. - 'John sees the apple'. Neutral sentence.\n*''J\u00e1nos'' '''l\u00e1tja''' az alm\u00e1t. - 'John '''sees''' the apple'. (Peter may not see the apple.)\n*'''J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja az ''alm\u00e1t''. - 'It is John who sees the apple'. (The listener may have thought that it is Peter.)\n*''J\u00e1nos''''' az alm\u00e1t '''l\u00e1tja. - 'What John sees is the apple'. (It is the apple, not the pear, that John specifically sees. However, Peter may see the pear.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' l\u00e1tja''' J\u00e1nos. - 'It is the apple that is seen by John'. (The pear may not be seen by John, but it may be smelled, for example.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja. - 'It is by John that the apple is seen'. (It is not seen by Peter, but the pear may be seen by Peter, for example.)\n\n==Politeness==\n{{Main article|T\u2013V distinction#Hungarian}}\n\nHungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n\n*''\u00d6n'' (''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here \"you\", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.\n*''Maga'' (''mag\u00e1z\u00e1s'', ''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as ''maga''. Aside from the different [[pronoun]] it is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\".\n*''N\u00e9ni/b\u00e1csi'' (''tetszikez\u00e9s''): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\" or \"''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''\", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role \"''tetszik''\" (\"like\") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parents, close friends or close relatives by using \"''tetszik''\" (\"you like\"): \"''Hogy vagy?''\" (\"How are you?\") here becomes \"''Hogy tetszik lenni?''\" (\"How do you like to be?\"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.\n*''Te'' (''tegez\u00e9s'', ''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s'' or ''pertu'', [[per tu]] from [[Latin]]): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address [[God]]. The highest rank, the [[king]], was traditionally addressed \"per tu\" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and by adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without [[T\u2013V distinction]] [[thou|in most contemporary dialects]]) on the Internet, \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.\n\nThe four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s''\".\n\nSome anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the ''te'' (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop [[IKEA]], whose web site and other publications address the customers in ''te'' form. When a news site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanizsaujsag.hu/hirek/8351/miert-tegezik-a-magyarokat-a-multik/|title=Mi\u00e9rt tegezik a magyarokat a multik? - Kanizsa \u00dajs\u00e1g|first=Kanizsa|last=Ujsag|website=Kanizsaujsag.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> asked IKEA\u2014using the ''te'' form\u2014why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer\u2014using the ''\u00f6n'' form\u2014that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France uses the polite (''vous'') form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers.

Kazinczy's chief goal was to replace existing words of German and Latin origins with newly-created Hungarian words. As a result, Kazinczy and his later followers (the reformers) significantly reduced the formerly high ratio of words of Latin and German origins in the Hungarian language, which were related to social sciences, natural sciences, politics and economics, institutional names, fashion etc.\nGiving an accurate estimate for the total word count is difficult, since it is hard to define \"a word\" in [[agglutination|agglutinating]] languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To obtain a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements.

(See an example on the right.) The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.\n\nThe basic vocabulary shares several hundred word roots with other [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]]. Examples are the verb ''\u00e9l'' \"live\" (Finnish ''el\u00e4\u00e4''<ref name=Helsinki>{{cite web|title=\"Related words\" in Finnish and Hungarian|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html|publisher=Helsinki University Bulletin|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>), the numbers ''kett\u0151'' (2), ''h\u00e1rom'' (3), ''n\u00e9gy'' (4) (cf.

Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers & gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship & religion were, too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~lukacs/DETREHUN.htm|title=PROTO-MAGYAR TEXTS FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1st MILLENIUM<!--sic-->?|website=Rmki.kfki.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n| width = 300px\n| title = Origin of word roots in modern Hungarian<ref name=\"kenesei-p134\">''A nyelv \u00e9s a nyelvek'' (\"Language and languages\"), edited by Istv\u00e1n Kenesei.

There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.\n\nAnother source<ref name=\"Halukinen-p307\">''The Structure and Development of the Finnish Language'', The Uralic and Altaic Series: 1960\u20131993 V.1-150, By Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Lauri Hakulinen, Gustav Bayerle, Translated by John R. Krueger, Compiled by Gustav Bayerle, Contributor Denis Sinor, Published by Routledge, 1997\n{{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0380-7}}, 383 pages. p. 307</ref> differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.\n\n===Word formation===\nWords can be compounds or derived.  Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.\n\n====Compounds====\nCompounds have been present in the language since the [[Proto-Uralic]] era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.\n\nA good example is the word ''arc'':\n\n:: ''orr'' (nose) + ''sz\u00e1j'' (mouth) \u2192 ''orca'' (face) (colloquial until the end of the 19th century and still in use in some dialects) > ''arc'' (face)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetismeret.hu/?id=3.2 |title=It's written in chapter Testr\u00e9szek |publisher=Nemzetismeret.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>\n\nCompounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be ''subordinative'': <!-- subordinative is \"al\u00e1rendel\u0151\" in Hungarian; it was rather coined by me. I can't find *ANY* reference on this in English. If you can, please translate al\u00e1rendel\u0151 properly. Other \"Hunglish\" words include subjective, objective, determinative, adjunctive and coordinative. --> the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a [[subjective case|subjective]] one. There are [[objective case|objective]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determinative]], and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]ive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:\n\n: Subjective:\n:: ''menny'' (heaven) + ''d\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (rumble) \u2192 ''mennyd\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (thundering)\n:: ''Nap'' (Sun) + ''s\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (lit by) \u2192 ''naps\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (sunlit)\n: Objective:\n:: ''fa'' (tree, wood) + ''v\u00e1g\u00f3'' (cutter) \u2192 ''fav\u00e1g\u00f3'' (lumberjack, literally \"woodcutter\")\n: Determinative:\n:: ''\u00faj'' (new) + ''j\u00e1'' (modification of ''-v\u00e1, -v\u00e9'' a suffix meaning \"making it to something\")  + ''\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (construction) \u2192 ''\u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (reconstruction, literally \"making something to be new by construction\")\n: Adjunctive:\n:: ''s\u00e1rga'' (yellow) + ''r\u00e9z'' (copper) \u2192 ''s\u00e1rgar\u00e9z'' (brass)\n\nAccording to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more [[syllables]] long  (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.\n\nOther compound words are ''coordinatives'': there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include [[reduplication]] (to emphasise the meaning; ''olykor-olykor''\n'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: ''gizgaz'', where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix ''giz'' is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, ''hercehurca'' 'complex, obsolete procedures').\n\nA compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:\n\n: ''elme'' [mind; standalone base] + (''gy\u00f3gy'' [medical] + ''int\u00e9zet'' [institute]) \u2192 ''elmegy\u00f3gyint\u00e9zet'' ([[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]])\n: (''hadi'' [militarian] + ''fogoly'' [prisoner]) + (''munka'' [work] + ''t\u00e1bor'' [camp]) \u2192 ''hadifogoly-munkat\u00e1bor'' (work camp of prisoners of war)\n\n===Noteworthy lexical items===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n====Points of the compass====\nHungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the Sun during the day in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n*North = \u00e9szak (from \"\u00e9j(szaka)\", 'night'), as the Sun never shines from the North\n*South = d\u00e9l ('noon'), as the Sun shines from the South at noon\n*East = kelet ('rise'), as the Sun rises in the East\n*West = nyugat ('set'), as the Sun sets in the West\n\n====Two words for \"red\"====\n<!-- Must this \"red\" issue really be this long? -->\n\nThere are two basic words for \"red\" in Hungarian: \"piros\" and \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" (variant: \"veres\"; compare with Estonian \"verev\" or Finnish \"punainen\"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English \"scarlet\" is of \"red\".) The word \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" is related to \"v\u00e9r\", meaning \"blood\" (Finnish and Estonian \"veri\"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between \"scarlet\"  and \"red\". While many languages have multiple [[colour name|names for this colour]], often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct \"[[folk colour]]s\".<ref name=\"basiccolor\">Berlin, B and Kay, P (1969). ''Basic Color Terms''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press</ref>\n\nHowever, the two words are also used independently of the above in [[collocation]]s. \"Piros\" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.\n\nWhen the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.\n\nExamples:\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"piros\": a red road sign, red traffic lights, the red line of [[Budapest Metro]], red (now called express) bus lines in Budapest, a holiday shown in red in the calendar, ruddy complexion, the red nose of a clown, some red flowers (those of a neutral nature, e.g. tulips), red peppers and paprika, red card suits (hearts and diamonds), red stripes on a flag (but the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and its variants translate to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\"), etc.\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\": [[Red Sea]], [[Red Square]], [[Red Army]], [[Red Baron]], [[Erik the Red]], [[red wine]], red carpet (for receiving important guests), red hair or beard, red lion (the mythical animal), the [[Red Cross]], the novel ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[redshift]], [[red giant]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[red oak]], some red flowers (those with passionate connotations, e.g. roses), red fox, names of ferric and other red minerals, red copper, rust, red phosphorus, the colour of blushing with anger or shame, the red nose of an alcoholic (in contrast with that of a clown, see above), the red posterior of a baboon, red meat, regular onion (not the red onion, which is \"lila\"), [[litmus paper]] (in acid), cities, countries, or other political entities associated with [[leftist]] movements (e.g. [[Red Vienna]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Red Russia]]), etc.\n\n====Kinship terms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for \"sibling\": ''testv\u00e9r'', from ''test'' \"body\" and ''v\u00e9r'' \"blood\"; ''i.e.'', originating from the same body and blood.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||younger||elder||unspecified{{br}}relative age\n|-\n|brother||''\u00f6cs<!--yes, it's written as \"\u00f6cs\", not \"\u00f6ccs\"-->''||''b\u00e1ty<!-- it is written as \"b\u00e1ty\", not \"b\u00e1tya\" -->''||''fiv\u00e9r'' or{{br}}''fi\u00fatestv\u00e9r''\n|-\n|sister||''h\u00fag''||''n\u0151v\u00e9r''||''n\u0151v\u00e9r'' or{{br}}''l\u00e1nytestv\u00e9r''\n|-\n|sibling|| <small>''kistestv\u00e9r''</small> || <small>''(nagytestv\u00e9r)''</small> ||''testv\u00e9r''\n|}\n\n(There used to be a separate word for \"elder sister\", ''n\u00e9ne'',<!-- NEM N\u00c9NI, HANEM N\u00c9NE, E-VEL--> but it has become obsolete [except to mean \"aunt\" in some dialects] and has been replaced by the generic word for \"sister\".)\n\nIn addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|parent||grandparent||great-{{br}}grandparent||great-great-{{br}}grandparent||great-great-great-{{br}}grandparent\n|great-great-great-great-\ngrandparent\n|-\n||''sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''nagysz\u00fcl\u0151''||''d\u00e9d(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''sz\u00e9p(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''{{br}}(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151'')\n|''\u00f3(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''\n(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck-\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151)''\n|-\n|child||grandchild||great-{{br}}grandchild||great-great-{{br}}grandchild||great-great-great-{{br}}grandchild\n|great-great-great-great-{{br}}grandchild\n|-\n|''gyerek''||''unoka''||''d\u00e9dunoka''||''\u00fckunoka''||''sz\u00e9punoka''{{br}}(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fckunoka'')\n|''\u00f3unoka''{{br}}(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck-\u00fckunoka'')\n|}\n\nThe words for \"boy\" and \"girl\" are applied with possessive suffixes.

However, the word ''fi\u00fa'' can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word ''(fi\u00faja)'' will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.\n\nThe word ''fi\u00fa'' (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming ''fiai\u00e9i'', adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| fi\u00fa || boy\n|-\n| fia || his/her son\n|-\n| fiai || his/her sons\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9 || his/her son's (singular object)\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9i || his/her son's (plural object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9 || his/her sons' (singular object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9i || his/her sons' (plural object)\n|}\n\n====Extremely long words====\n*''megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek\u00e9rt''\n: Partition to root and suffixes with explanations:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| meg- || verb prefix; in this case, it means \"completed\"\n|-\n| szent || holy (the word root)\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || like English \"-ness\", as in \"holiness\"\n|-\n| -t(e)len || variant of \"-tlen\", noun suffix expressing the lack of something; like English \"-less\", as in \"useless\"\n|-\n| -\u00edt || constitutes a transitive verb from an adjective\n|-\n| -het || expresses possibility; somewhat similar to the English modal verbs \"may\" or \"can\"\n|-\n| -(e)tlen || another variant of \"-tlen\"\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || (see above)\n|-\n| -es || constitutes an adjective from a noun; like English \"-y\" as in \"witty\"\n|-\n| -ked || attached to an adjective (e.g. \"strong\"), produces the verb \"to pretend to be (strong)\" <!-- cf. \"okoskodik\", \"er\u0151sk\u00f6dik\"; the \"-ik\" is dropped due to the further suffixes, thus it is better not to mark it in the table -->\n|-\n| -\u00e9s || constitutes a noun from a verb; there are various ways this is done in English, e.g. \"-ance\" in \"acceptance\"\n|-\n| -eitek || plural possessive suffix, second-person plural (e.g. \"apple\" \u2192 \"your apples\", where \"your\" refers to multiple people)\n|-\n| -\u00e9rt || approximately translates to \"because of\", or in this case simply \"for\"\n|}\n\n: '''Translation:''' \"for your [plural] repeated pretending to be indesecrable\"<!-- the element \"repeated\" comes from -s\u00e9gesked\u00e9s-, which can refer to a constant and annoying habit-->\n\nThe above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:\n\n* ''legeslegmegszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edttethetetlenebbjeitekk\u00e9nt''\n:''leges-leg-meg-'''''szent'''''-s\u00e9g-telen-\u00edt-tet-het-etlen-ebb-je-i-tek-k\u00e9nt''\n:\"like those of you that are the very least possible to get desecrated\"\n\nWords of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see [[agglutinative language]]). They are not compound words\u2014they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root (\"szent\", saint or holy).\nThere is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.\n\n====Hungarian words in English====\nThe English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably ''[[paprika]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''papar'' \"pepper\" and the Hungarian diminutive ''-ka''.  The most common however is ''[[Coach (carriage)|coach]]'', from ''kocsi'', originally ''kocsi szek\u00e9r'' \"car from/in the style of [[Kocs]]\".

Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practised by some enthusiasts.\n\nModern Hungarian is written using an expanded [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents ''(\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa)'' to represent long vowels, and umlauts (''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') and their long counterparts [[Double acute accent|''\u0151'' and ''\u0171'']] to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) {{angle bracket|\u00f4}} or {{angle bracket|\u00f5}} is used for {{angle bracket|\u0151}}, and {{angle bracket|\u00fb}} for {{angle bracket|\u0171}}. This is often due to the limitations of the [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page]]. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page]], but this [[code page]] is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both {{angle bracket|\u0151}} and {{angle bracket|\u0171}}.) [[Unicode]] includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the letter pairs [[Hungarian ny|{{angle bracket|ny}}]], [[Hungarian ty|{{angle bracket|ty}}]], and [[Hungarian gy|{{angle bracket|gy}}]] represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/\u025f/}} (a little like the \"d+y\" sounds in British \"''du''ke\" or American \"woul''d y''ou\")\u2014a bit like saying \"d\" with the tongue pointing to the [[palate]].\n\nHungarian uses {{angle bracket|s}} for {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and [[Hungarian sz|{{angle bracket|sz}}]] for {{IPA|/s/}}, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]] usage. The letter [[Hungarian zs|{{angle bracket|zs}}]] is {{IPA|/\u0292/}} and [[Hungarian cs|{{angle bracket|cs}}]] is {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}. These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter [[Hungarian ly|{{angle bracket|ly}}]] is also a \"single letter digraph\", but is pronounced like {{IPA|/j/}} (English {{angle bracket|y}}), and appears mostly in old words. The letters [[Hungarian dz|{{angle bracket|dz}}]] and [[Hungarian dzs|{{angle bracket|dzs}}]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are ''madzag'' (\"string\"), ''edzeni'' (\"to train (athletically)\") and ''dzsungel'' (\"jungle\").\n\nSometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: h\u00e1zsz\u00e1m (\"street number\") = ''h\u00e1z'' (\"house\") + ''sz\u00e1m'' (\"number\"), not an unintelligible ''h\u00e1zs'' + ''z\u00e1m''.\n\nHungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, ''lenni'' (\"to be\"), ''hozz\u00e1sz\u00f3l\u00e1s'' (\"comment\"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: {{angle bracket|sz}} + {{angle bracket|sz}} = {{angle bracket|ssz}}, e.g. ''m\u0171v\u00e9sszel'' (\"with an artist\"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, (\"with a bus\"):\n:... ''busz-''\n:''szal''...\n\nWhen the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: ''jegy'' + ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' = ''jegygy\u0171r\u0171'' (\"engagement/wedding ring\", ''jegy'' means \"sign\", \"mark\". The term ''jegyben lenni/j\u00e1rni'' means \"to be engaged\"; ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' means \"ring\").\n\nUsually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' (\"eighteen\") is a concatenation of ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling [[minimal pair]]s: ''tol'' (\"push\") vs. ''toll'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\").\n\nWhile to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and \"ly, j\" representing {{IPA|/j/}}).\n\n==Word order==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe [[word order]] is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.\n\n===Name order===\n{{Main article|Hungarian names}}\nThe Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.\n\n====Hungarian names in foreign languages====\nFor clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary&nbsp;\u2013 where there is a [[Treaty of Trianon|significant Hungarian population]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.\n\nFor an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist called the \"father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]\" was '''''Teller Ede''''', but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as '''''[[Edward Teller]]'''''. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses ''[[Andr\u00e1s Schiff]]'' when abroad, not ''Andrew Schiff'' (in Hungarian ''Schiff Andr\u00e1s''). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.\n\n====Foreign names in Hungarian====\nIn modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:\n\n*Amikor ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' Los Angelesben volt, l\u00e1tta ''John Travolt\u00e1t.'' (means: When J\u00e1nos Kiss was in [[Los Angeles]] he saw John Travolta.)\n:The Hungarian name ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' is in the Hungarian name order (''J\u00e1nos'' is equivalent to ''John''), but the foreign name ''John Travolta'' remains in the western name order.\n\nBefore the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also \"Hungarianised\": ''Goethe J\u00e1nos Farkas'' (originally [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including ''Verne Gyula'' ([[Jules Verne]]), ''Marx K\u00e1roly'' ([[Karl Marx]]), ''Kolumbusz Krist\u00f3f'' ([[Christopher Columbus]]; note that the last of these is also translated in English from the original Italian or possibly Ligurian).\n\nSome native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as ''Luther M\u00e1rton'' ([[Martin Luther]]), ''Husz J\u00e1nos'' ([[Jan Hus]]), ''K\u00e1lvin J\u00e1nos'' ([[John Calvin]]); just like the names of monarchs, for example the king of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I]] is referred to as ''I. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1roly'' or the queen of the UK, [[Elizabeth II]] is referred to as ''II. Erzs\u00e9bet''.\n\n[[Japanese names]], which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. ''Kuroszava Akira'' instead of [[Akira Kurosawa]].\n\n====Date and time====\nThe Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)\n\nThe year and day are always written in [[Arabic numerals]], followed by a [[full stop]]. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.\n\nHours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the [[24-hour clock]] format, but in verbal (and written) communication [[12-hour clock]] format can also be used. See below for usage examples.\n\nDate and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.\n\n*2008. febru\u00e1r 9. 16:23:42 ''or'' 2008. febru\u00e1r 9., 16:23:42\n*2008. febr. 9.\n*2008. 02. 09. ''or'' 2008. 2. 9. (rarely)\n*2008. II. 9.\n\nDate separated by [[hyphen]] is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here&nbsp;\u2013 just like the version separated by full stops&nbsp;\u2013 leading zeros are in use.\n\n*2008-02-09\n\nWhen only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only \"displaying\" time), these parts can be separated by a [[full stop]] (e.g. \"Tal\u00e1lkozzunk 10.35-kor.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"Let's meet at 10.35.\"), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in [[superscript]] (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup>35</sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\" ''or'' \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup><u>35</u></sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"The meeting begins at 10.35.\").\n\nAlso, in verbal and written communication it is common to use \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt\" (literally \"before noon\") and \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n\" (lit. \"after noon\") abbreviated as \"de.\" and \"du.\" respectively. D\u00e9lel\u0151tt and d\u00e9lut\u00e1n is said or written before the time, e.g. \"D\u00e9lut\u00e1n 4 \u00f3ra van.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"It's 4 p.m.\". However e.g. \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt 5 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"5 a.m.\") or \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n 10 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"10 p.m.\") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead \"hajnal\" (\"dawn\"), \"reggel\" (\"morning\"), \"este\" (\"evening\") and \"\u00e9jjel\" (\"night\") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says \"Reggel 6-kor ettem.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I had food at ''*morning'' 6.\", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says \"Hajnali 6-kor m\u00e9g aludtam.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I was still sleeping at ''*dawn'' 6.\"). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Expression!!Approximate time\n|-\n|Hajnal||4\u20136 a.m.\n|-\n|Reggel||6\u20139 a.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9lel\u0151tt (de.)||9 a.m.&nbsp;\u2013 12 p.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9l*||=12 p.m. (=\"noon\")\n|-\n|D\u00e9lut\u00e1n (du.)||12\u20136 p.m.\n|-\n|Este||6\u201311 p.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jjel||11 p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 4 a.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jf\u00e9l*||=12 a.m. (=\"midnight\")\n|}\n* * \"D\u00e9l\" and \"\u00e9jf\u00e9l\" mean these exact times, so using time after them is incorrect. So there is '''no''' \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l 0-kor m\u00e9g buliztunk\" (\"We were still partying at ''*midnight 0''.\") or \"D\u00e9l 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\" (\"The sun shines at ''*noon 12''.\"). Instead \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l'''kor''' m\u00e9g buliztunk.\" and \"D\u00e9l'''ben''' s\u00fct a nap.\" is correct. (More confusingly, one can say \"D\u00e9l'''i''' 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\", meaning \"The sun shines at 12 '''of''' noon.\", i.e. \"The sun shines at 12, which is the 12 of daytime.\") \"D\u00e9len s\u00fct a nap\" on the other hand means \"The sun shines in the south\", as D\u00e9l means both noon and south.\n\n==== Addresses ====\n\nAlthough address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:\n\n'''Budapest, De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r 1. 1052'''\n\nSo the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:\n\nName of the recipient<br />\nSettlement<br />\nStreet address (up to door number if necessary)<br />\n(HU-)postcode\n\n==Vocabulary examples==\n''Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word.  The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress.  All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.''\n\n=== Numbers ===\n<small>Source: Wiktionary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Hungarian_cardinal_numbers|title=Category:Hungarian cardinal numbers - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref></small>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report.

Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.<ref name=rad/> Revictimisation may be \"facilitated, tolerated, and even produced by particular institutional contexts, illustrating how the risk of revictimization is not a characteristic of the individual, nor is it destiny.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bj\u00f8rnholt |first1=M |year=2019 |title=The social dynamics of revictimization and intimate partner violence: an embodied, gendered, institutional and life course perspective |url= |journal=[[Nordic Journal of Criminology]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013110|doi=10.1080/14043858.2019.1568103 }}</ref>\n\nRevictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is \"normal\" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.<ref name=messman/>  One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].\n\n== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==\n\nIn adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | url = | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635\u2013648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958}}</ref> This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.\n\n==Self-victimisation==\n{{Main|Victim playing}}\nSelf-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].\n\n==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==\n{{Main|Victim mentality}}\nVictims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] sometimes get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation.

However, the UCR and self-report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries.

To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report. This is not only harmful to the individual, but to society, in that perpetrators are thus permitted to continue committing crimes and abuse. As a consequence of victim-blaming and other negative attitudes towards victims, reported rates of criminal abuse are low and distress in victims is high.<ref name=\"Orth, U. 2002\"/>\n\n===Interactions with the criminal justice system===\nDespite high rates of secondary victimization, reporting rates are low.

Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.<ref name=rad/> Revictimisation may be \"facilitated, tolerated, and even produced by particular institutional contexts, illustrating how the risk of revictimization is not a characteristic of the individual, nor is it destiny.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bj\u00f8rnholt |first1=M |year=2019 |title=The social dynamics of revictimization and intimate partner violence: an embodied, gendered, institutional and life course perspective |url= |journal=[[Nordic Journal of Criminology]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013110|doi=10.1080/14043858.2019.1568103 }}</ref>\n\nRevictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is \"normal\" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.<ref name=messman/>  One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].\n\n== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==\n\nIn adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | url = | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635\u2013648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958}}</ref> This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.\n\n==Self-victimisation==\n{{Main|Victim playing}}\nSelf-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].\n\n==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==\n{{Main|Victim mentality}}\nVictims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] sometimes get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation.
