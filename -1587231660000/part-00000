Shani has also been raising her spirited son Jomo, a very energetic young elephant who just wants to play with the other animals, such as lechwes and [[baboons]].\n\nWhen the land is about to dry up, Gaia leads the elephants to an almost dry waterhole to enjoy the mud before leaving the desert. They are soon joined by other elephants who visit, play, and drink from the water. When the water dries up, Gaia notices a baby elephant suffocating and stuck in the mud, so she goes to its rescue, and the baby is reunited with its mother. \n\nThe Herd leaves the desert to join the other elephants on the long journey, they take a lunch break to have a family reunion with other herds of elephants, with some not seeing Gaia for over a year. Jomo starts making new friends with the other baby elephants, and for ages, Shani reunites with many of her long lost cousins. Gaia's herd and other herds of elephants have no luck trying to find food, but a male elephant (who is visiting his family) uses his trunk to drop a bunch of seedpods from trees. Everyone munches happily.\n\nGaia's herd comes across ancient paths that their ancestors created when they migrated. When they've reached a dry waterhole, they noticed an elephant skeleton. Shani shows a confused Jomo a life lesson. The herd moves on and finds another waterhole (this time with water). As the elephants drink, Jomo plays with a group of [[warthogs]]. The water is ruined by its previous visitors, so the elephants munch on Mopani trees but are chased off by caterpillars eating the entire trees.\n\nThe Herd continues their journey to a small little island. There is no water for them to drink, but Gaia leads her herd to Baobab trees which they could drink water from its sap. Shani teaches the young elephants how to get sap by ripping the thick bark. The Herd rests on the island for the night.\n\nContinuing their journey, the Herd trudges through sand storms. Shani and Gaia sense the ground trembling, which meant a river close by, but they are despaired when they reach the river. It is far below the cliffs where the elephants are, but thanks to the help of a flock of Quelea birds, the herd makes their way to [[Victoria Falls]], the place that Gaia has been searching for. The Herd happily drinks, but are soon confronted by [[crocodiles]]. Luckily no one was hurt when they crossed the river. They reach the islands, and The Herd enjoys their times in Victoria Falls and even munch on [[Palm nuts]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the highlands of [[Angola]], rain starts to pour, which means the water is going off to the [[Okavango Delta]], Shani and Jomo's home.\n\nSoon after, Gaia starts to get tired and weak and finds the food hard to eat. She and The Herd start making their way back to Okavango. Shani helps Gaia gather the herd, with Jomo by their side. Gaia realizes that the Angolan falls are early, and she and Shani immediately gather the herd to use the shortest route, but they soon find themselves confronted by a pride of [[Lions]]. As the elephants settle in for the night, the lions attack Jomo, but he is saved by Shani. But by morning, Gaia dies, with the herd sharing a heartbreaking goodbye to their great matriarch, while the lions share their feast. Shani finds her leadership to the other elephants difficult. A week later, an elephant gives birth to a newborn baby calf. Jomo is unimpressed, but soon lets go of being the baby of the family and warms up to his new playmate.\n\nShani soon uses Gaia's memories, and begins to lead the herd back to the Delta. They are soon confronted by a rival herd of elephants, who are going after the newborn calf. Shani stands her ground at the rival matriarch, and the rival herd retreats. They make their way home to Okavango, where the land is bursting back to life. The Herd soon accepts Shani as the new matriarch, while Jomo teaches the newborn calf how to play with the other animals.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|12036052}}\n* {{Disney+ movie}}\n\n{{Disney+ Films}}\n{{Disneynature}}\n\n[[Category:2020 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Disneynature films]]\n[[Category:Disney+ original films]]\n[[Category:Films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Linfield]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n{{nature-documentary-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Film about elephants}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Elephant\n| image          = Elephant - official release poster.jpg\n| caption        = Official release poster\n| director       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Mark Linfield]]\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n}}\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Linfield\n* Vanessa Berlowitz\n* [[Roy Conli]]\n}}\n| writer         = \n| narrator       = [[Meghan Markle]]\n| music          = [[Ramin Djawadi]]\n| cinematography = {{Plainlist|\n* Martyn Colbeck\n* Mike Holding\n* Tom Walker\n}}\n| editing        = \n| studio         = [[Disneynature]]\n| distributor    = [[Disney+]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2020|04|03}}\n| runtime        = 89 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Elephant''''' is an American [[Nature documentary|nature documentary]] film about [[Elephant|elephants]] directed by [[Mark Linfield]] and Vanessa Berlowitz and narrated by [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]].<ref>https://dtcimedia.disney.com/news/earth-month-disneynature-2020</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/meghan-markle-disney-plus-elephants-1203545835/|title=Meghan Markle Narrating Disney Plus Nature Documentary \u2018Elephants\u2019|website=Variety|last=Vary|first=Adam B.|date=March 26, 2020|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> It is the fifteenth nature documentary to be released under the [[Disneynature]] label.

The films take place in a [[fictional universe]] that revolves around a serial killer, dubbed [[The Jigsaw Killer]], who captures victims who he believes do not appreciate their life and puts them into traps to test their survival instinct.

Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures. Fan films are also examples of [[fan labor]] and the [[remix culture]]. Closely related concepts are [[Fandub]]s, [[Fansub]]s and [[Vidding]] which are reworks of fans on already released film material.\n\nDue to copyright protection, trademark protection and limited [[fair use]] provisions, fan films made without official authorization might exist in a legal grey area.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sydell|first=Laura|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103673352|title=High-Def 'Hunt For Gollum' New Lord Of The Fanvids|date=30 April 2009|work=[[All Things Considered]]|accessdate=1 May 2009|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|authorlink=Laura Sydell}}</ref>\n\nStill, fan films often operate under the radar or IP owners [[turning a blind eye]] as long these are a non-commercial activities.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite news|last=Masters|first=Tim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8022623.stm|title=Making Middle-earth on a shoestring|date=30 April 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 May 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nAlso, lawmakers strengthened fan activities in recent years by extending fair use cases; for instance, in 2012 [[Canada]]'s [[Copyright Modernization Act]] explicitly added an exemption which allows non-commercial creation of fan film material.<ref name=\"WIPO2015_4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma|last=Rostama|first=Guilda|date=June 1, 2015|publisher=[[WIPO]]|accessdate=2016-03-14|quote=Canada is one of a few countries, if not the only one, to have introduced into its copyright law a new exception for non-commercial user-generated content.

The films take place in a [[fictional universe]] that revolves around a serial killer, dubbed [[The Jigsaw Killer]], who captures victims who he believes do not appreciate their life and puts them into traps to test their survival instinct. While starting as a film series, ''Saw'' has evolved to encompass numerous media forms including video games and comics as well as mazes and a roller coaster and even [[Fan film|fan films.]]\n\n== Fan Films ==\n{{Main|Fan film|l1=Fan Fims}}\n\nA '''fan film''' is a [[film]] or [[video]] inspired by a film, [[television program]], [[comic book]], book, or video game created by [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures. Fan films are also examples of [[fan labor]] and the [[remix culture]]. Closely related concepts are [[Fandub]]s, [[Fansub]]s and [[Vidding]] which are reworks of fans on already released film material.\n\nDue to copyright protection, trademark protection and limited [[fair use]] provisions, fan films made without official authorization might exist in a legal grey area.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sydell|first=Laura|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103673352|title=High-Def 'Hunt For Gollum' New Lord Of The Fanvids|date=30 April 2009|work=[[All Things Considered]]|accessdate=1 May 2009|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|authorlink=Laura Sydell}}</ref>\n\nStill, fan films often operate under the radar or IP owners [[turning a blind eye]] as long these are a non-commercial activities.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite news|last=Masters|first=Tim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8022623.stm|title=Making Middle-earth on a shoestring|date=30 April 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 May 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nAlso, lawmakers strengthened fan activities in recent years by extending fair use cases; for instance, in 2012 [[Canada]]'s [[Copyright Modernization Act]] explicitly added an exemption which allows non-commercial creation of fan film material.<ref name=\"WIPO2015_4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma|last=Rostama|first=Guilda|date=June 1, 2015|publisher=[[WIPO]]|accessdate=2016-03-14|quote=Canada is one of a few countries, if not the only one, to have introduced into its copyright law a new exception for non-commercial user-generated content.

She practiced the correct accent and the nuances of the language which later made her one of the most sought after singers in the industry. She was the favorite of many popular music composers like [[V. Dakshinamoorthy|V Dakshinamoorthi]], [[Baburaj|MS Baburaj]], [[Shyam]], [[M. K. Arjunan|MK Arjunan]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] Master, [[Raveendran]] Master, [[M. B. Sreenivasan|MB Sreenivasan]], A.T.Ummer, and [[Salil Chowdhury|Salil Choudhary]].\n\nS Janaki went on to sing thousands of songs from early 1960s to mid 80s. She received her first Kerala state film award for best singer in 1970 and went on to win the same almost every year for the next 15 years. It was her command over the language and perfect diction that took her to great heights in Malayalam films. S Janaki is perhaps the only non-Malayali artist who has won maximum awards in Malayalam films.\n\nSome of her hit solo tracks in Malayalam films are:\n* \"Thaliritta Kinaakkal\" [[Moodupadam]] (1963)\n* \"Sooryakaanthi\" [[Kattuthulasi]] (1965)\n* \"Aa Nimishathinte\" [[Chandrakantham]] (1974)\n* \"Unni Arariro\" [[Avalude Ravukal]] (1978)\n* \"Mazhavil Kodi Kavadi\" [[Swapnam]] (1973)\n* \"Unaroo Vegam Nee\" [[Moodalmanju]] (1970)\n* \"Vasantha Panchami Naalil\" [[Bhargavi Nilayam]] (1964)\n* \"Sandhye Kanneerithende\" [[Madanolsavam]] (1978)\n*\"Malarkodi Pole\" [[Vishukkani|Vishukanni]] (1977)\n*\"Mouname Nirayum\" [[Thakara]] (1980)\n* \"Naadha Neevarum Kaalocha\" [[Chamaram]] (1980)\n* \"Thumbi Vaa Thumbakudathin\" [[Olangal]] (1982)\n*\"Moham Kondu Njan\" [[Sesham Kazhchayil|Shesham Kazhchayil]] (1985)\n* \"Thenum Vayambum\" [[Thenum Vayambum]] (1981)\n*\"Olathumbathirunnu\" [[Pappayude Swantham Appoos|Pappayude swantham Appose]] (1992)\n*\"Swarna Mukile\" [[Ithu Njangalude Katha]] (1982)\n*\"Konchi Karayalle\" [[Poomukhappadiyil Ninneyum Kaathu|Poomukha padiyil ninneyum kaathu]] (1986)\n*\"Kaikkudanna Niraye\" [[Maya Mayooram|Mayamayooram]] (1993)\n*\"Sarapoli Mala\" [[April 19 (film)|April 19]] (1996)\n*\"Amma Poovinum\" [[10 Kalpanakal]] (2016)<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch S Janaki's last song Ammapoovinum from Malayalam movie 10 Kalpanakal |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/watch-janakis-last-song-ammapoovinum-074221813.html |work=in.news.yahoo.com |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\n===Tamil films===\nS Janaki sang her first Tamil song in 1957. The song ''Singaravelane Deva'' from the movie ''Konjum Salangai'' brought her to limelight in Tamil films. [[M. S. Viswanathan|M S Viswanathan]] gave her many hit songs every year throughout 60s and early 70s. It was the song ''Unnidathil ennaik kodutthen'' [[Avalukendru Oru Manam]] (1971) that consolidated her position as the most promising singer thereafter.\n\nShe sang many songs under many famous composers. [[Ilaiyaraaja]] - [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SP Balasubramanyam]]- S Janaki combination gave hit after hit from mid 1970s till 1990s. S Janaki is the only singer who has won state awards under the oft-called top three music composers of the state ([[M. S. Viswanathan|MS Vishwanathan]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and [[A. R. Rahman|AR Rahman]]).\n\nSome of her best solos in Tamil cinema are:\n* \"Singara Velane deva\" [[Konjum Salangai]] (1962)\n*Sendhoora Poove\" [[16 Vayathinile]] (1977)\n* \"Kuyile Kavikkuyile\" [[Kavikkuyil]] (1977)\n* \"Annakkili Unnai\" [[Annakkili]] (1976)\n* \"Kaatril Endhan\" [[Johnny (1980 film)|Johnny]] (1980)\n* \"Ponmeni Urugudhe\" [[Moondram Pirai]] (1982)\n*\"Azhagu Malaraada\"''[[Vaidhegi Kaathirunthaal]]'' (1984) \n* \"Chinna Chinna Vannakuyil\" [[Mouna Ragam]] (1986)\n* \"Ooru Sanam\" [[Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu]] (1986)\n* \"Chinna Thayaval\" [[Thalapathi]] (1991)\n* \"Aasai Athigam Vechu''\"[[Marupadiyum]](1993)''\n*Margazhi Thingal Allava\" [[Sangamam]] (1999)\n\n===Telugu films===\nS Janaki started her career in Telugu films in 1957. Movies like ''Bava maradalu'', ''Pooja Phalam'' and ''Bangaru Panjaram'' had songs by S Janaki which were immensely popular. She gave continuous hits throughout 1960s and 70s. She continued to give hits till mid 90s.

He decided to have songs sung by her in his upcoming Hindi movies and introduced her to Bollywood.<ref name=\"YouTube\"/> She sang many duets with [[Kishore Kumar]].\n\nSome of her notable Hindi songs are\n* \"Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Aayaa jab se tu dil mein\" [[Jhoothi]] (1985)\n* \"Jawan Hai Dil Jawan Hain Hum\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Sun Rubia Tumse Pyar Ho Gaya\" [[Mard (1985 film)|Mard]] (1985)\n* \"Mamla Gadbad Hai\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Aankhen do\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Tune mera doodh piya\" [[Aakhree Raasta]] (1986)\n* \"Pag Paadam\" [[Naache Mayuri]](1986)\n* \"Dil mein ho tum\" [[Satyamev Jayate (film)|Satyamev Jayate]] (1987)\n* \"Main tere liye\" [[Main Tere Liye]] (1989)\n* \"Poocho Na Kysa Maza\" [[Awwal Number]] (1990)\n\n===Oriya films===\nS Janaki sang many evergreen songs in Oriya. She has sung about 68 songs in Odia films. Her songs are still popular today and she also won 1 [[Orissa State Film Award]].\n\n===Other languages===\n\nS Janaki sang songs in 17 languages, though her top hits were in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.  She also sang a few songs in other languages. 109 Hindi songs, 68 Odia songs, 4 Sinhalese songs, 2 Tulu songs, 1 Badaga song, 2 Sanskrit songs, 1 Punjabi song...\n* One Japanese song in [[Adutha Veettu Penn]] (1960)\n* One German song in [[Puthu Paatu]] (1990)\n* One English song in [[Swayamkrushi]] (1986).\n\n==Collaboration with Music Directors==\n\nS Janaki has worked with music directors of different generations. From the early 1960s she was given songs by composers mainly in Kannada and Malayalam films.Though she sang fewer songs in Telugu and Tamil during the beginning of her career she went on to rule the playback industry across all four south Indian languages from mid 1970s.\n\n===G. K. Venkatesh===\n[[G. K. Venkatesh]] was one of the early composers who brought a renaissance in Kannada film music.\nHe started composing for more films from early 1960s and went on to give some remarkable songs to Janaki. GKV-SJ-PBS combination was the talk of the town those days.\nTwo songs which need special mention from this combination are \"nambide ninna naadhadevate\" from Sandhya Raga and \"Karedaru kelade\" from Sanaadi Appanna: both became very popular.\n\n===Ilaiyaraaja===\n[[Ilaiyaraaja]] knew about Janaki's vocal range and versatility when he worked with G K Venkatesh. When he got a chance to compose music for his debut film [[Annakkili]] (1976) he made Janaki sing 3 songs which became immensely popular thus beginning an era in Tamil cinema. This combination churned out hits after hits pushing S Janaki to the numero uno position for at least the next 2 decades. S Janaki won 4 state awards in Tamil in his compositions. He explored her voice in wide variety of songs and she became the first choice for songs with village background.\n\nShe sang maximum duets with Balasubramanium, Malaysia Vasudevan, Mano, Yesudas, Jayachandran. Ilayaraaja himself sang around 200 duets with Janaki; most were chart busters. After IR started giving more songs to SJ, even other music composers followed by making her sing their top hits.\n\nSPB-IR-SJ created some of the finest duets of Tamil cinemas. 1980s saw the meteoric rise of Janaki with a strong back up from Ilayaraja, as she sang his songs in all four South Indian languages.\n\n===M. S. Baburaj===\nThe earliest recognised collaboration of S Janaki's was with the Malayalam composer [[MS Baburaj]], who specialised in Hindustani music. Under his direction, Janaki was able to give voice to some of Kerala's best loved film songs of all time during the 1960s and early 1970s. The songs they've worked on have been known for their outward expressions, both in voice and the composition by itself. Some of Janaki's best known solos come from this collaboration, including ''Vasantha Panchami Naalil'' ([[Bhargavi Nilayam]]), ''Anjana Kannezhuthi'' ([[Thacholi Othenan]]), and ''Thaane Thirinjum Marinjum'' ([[Ambalapravu]]).\n\n===Rajan\u2013Nagendra===\nRajan and Nagendra have a unique place in hearts of Kannada music lovers.\nS Janaki was a part of almost all their albums. During the initial days, RN gave many duets to PBS-SJ. Later their main singers were SPB and S Janaki.  Almost all of their songs remain etched as the unforgettable melodies of Kannada Cinema. The romantic duets that came out from the SPB-S Janaki-[[Rajan-Nagendra]] combination are considered to be heavenly and evergreen. Radios called the pair of SPB and S Janaki as \"Love Birds\" and are termed to be the \"Best singing pair\" in Kannada cinema, owing mainly to their romantic duets composed by Rajan-Nagendra in the 1970s and 80s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjanaki.net/kannada/with-spb|title=sjanaki.net|website=www.sjanaki.net}}</ref>\nIn terms of numbers it was Rajan-Nagendra who gave maximum songs to Janaki after Ilaiyaraaja. \nThe solos and duets that S Janaki rendered under these music composers can never be erased from the minds of Kannada audience. Some top hit songs came from movies such as Eradu Kanasu, Hombisilu,  Gaali Maathu, Pavana Ganga, Avala Hejje, Chandana Gombe,  Naa Ninna Bidalare and the list continues.\n\n===Hamsalekha===\nBy the end of 80s [[Hamsalekha]] established himself as the top music composer in Kannada cinema pushing all the veteran composers to the background. His strong association with actor Ravichandran resulted in so many hit songs. S Janaki was his first choice during the initial days of his career. SPB-SJ-HL created some of the evergreen duets in movies like [[Premaloka]] and [[Ranadheera]].\nS Janaki worked in more than 40 films with Hamsalekha and sang all-time hit solos and duets.\n\n===Vijaya Bhaskar===\nKannada cinema offered SJ real gems of her singing career and [[Vijaya Bhaskar]] is no exception. Though his main singers were P Susheela in 60s and Vani Jayaram and Chitra in 70s and 80s, he gave some of his best compositions to S Janaki in movies like [[Gejje Pooje]], [[Bellimoda]], [[Upasane]], [[Seetha (1970 film)]]; he chose her whenever the song needed some special singing. \"Gaganavu ello bhoomiyu ello\" remains one of the most memorable songs of S Janaki. If we take the top 10 songs of S Janaki in Kannada cinema there would definitely be at least 2 songs composed by Bhaskar.\n\n===A. R. Rahman===\nDuring 90's Janaki sang many great Tamil songs for [[A.R.Rahman|A. R. Rahman]] at the early stage of his career. Songs like \"Ottagatha Kattiko\", \"Gopala Gopala\", \"Nenjinele\", \"Kadhal Kaditham Theetave\", \"Mudhalvane\", \"Kathirika\", \"Endhan Nenjil\", \"Margazhi Thinkal\" and many are still popular. She won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback]] for Margazhi Thinkal allava from the film [[Sangamam]] under his composition.\n\n==Legacy & popularity==\nJanaki and voice modulation is synonymous. She has done a wide range of voice modulation according to the age of the character in all four South Indian languages.\nShe is perhaps the only singer who won state awards for the same. Tamil Nadu state award for \"Poda poda pokka\" song from [[Uthiripookkal]] (1978) and Andhra Pradesh State award for \"Govullu tellana\" song from [[Saptapadi (1981 film)]]. Songs she sang in kids-voice in 70s in Kannada too were popular, one such song is \"Thayiya thandeya\" from the film [[Madhura Sangama]](1978). She sang many such songs for 3 year old, young boy, goatish voice, male voice and voice of aged woman. She sung more than 100 such songs across all languages.\n\n===Toughest song===\nJanaki says that the toughest song of her singing career is the fastest swaras [[Kannada]] song \"Shiva shiva ennada naaligeyeke\" from the movie ''[[Hemavathi_(film)]]''. The song, which is in two different ragas, ''Thodi'' and ''Aabhogi'', was composed by L. Vaidyanathan.<ref name=\"dbsjeyaraj.com\">{{cite web|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/15504|title=South Indian Singer S.Janaki Explains why She is not Accepting the \"Padma

She practiced the correct accent and the nuances of the language which later made her one of the most sought after singers in the industry. She was the favorite of many popular music composers like [[V. Dakshinamoorthy|V Dakshinamoorthi]], [[Baburaj|MS Baburaj]], [[Shyam]], [[M. K. Arjunan|MK Arjunan]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] Master, [[Raveendran]] Master, [[M. B. Sreenivasan|MB Sreenivasan]], A.T.Ummer, and [[Salil Chowdhury|Salil Choudhary]].\n\nS Janaki went on to sing thousands of songs from early 1960s to mid 80s. She received her first Kerala state film award for best singer in 1970 and went on to win the same almost every year for the next 15 years. It was her command over the language and perfect diction that took her to great heights in Malayalam films. S Janaki is perhaps the only non-Malayali artist who has won maximum awards in Malayalam films.\n\nSome of her hit solo tracks in Malayalam films are:\n* \"Thaliritta Kinaakkal\" [[Moodupadam]] (1963)\n* \"Sooryakaanthi\" [[Kattuthulasi]] (1965)\n* \"Aa Nimishathinte\" [[Chandrakantham]] (1974)\n* \"Unni Arariro\" [[Avalude Ravukal]] (1978)\n* \"Mazhavil Kodi Kavadi\" [[Swapnam]] (1973)\n* \"Unaroo Vegam Nee\" [[Moodalmanju]] (1970)\n* \"Vasantha Panchami Naalil\" [[Bhargavi Nilayam]] (1964)\n* \"Sandhye Kanneerithende\" [[Madanolsavam]] (1978)\n*\"Malarkodi Pole\" [[Vishukkani|Vishukanni]] (1977)\n*\"Mouname Nirayum\" [[Thakara]] (1980)\n* \"Naadha Neevarum Kaalocha\" [[Chamaram]] (1980)\n* \"Thumbi Vaa Thumbakudathin\" [[Olangal]] (1982)\n*\"Moham Kondu Njan\" [[Sesham Kazhchayil|Shesham Kazhchayil]] (1985)\n* \"Thenum Vayambum\" [[Thenum Vayambum]] (1981)\n*\"Olathumbathirunnu\" [[Pappayude Swantham Appoos|Pappayude swantham Appose]] (1992)\n*\"Swarna Mukile\" [[Ithu Njangalude Katha]] (1982)\n*\"Konchi Karayalle\" [[Poomukhappadiyil Ninneyum Kaathu|Poomukha padiyil ninneyum kaathu]] (1986)\n*\"Kaikkudanna Niraye\" [[Maya Mayooram|Mayamayooram]] (1993)\n*\"Sarapoli Mala\" [[April 19 (film)|April 19]] (1996)\n*\"Amma Poovinum\" [[10 Kalpanakal]] (2016)<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch S Janaki's last song Ammapoovinum from Malayalam movie 10 Kalpanakal |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/watch-janakis-last-song-ammapoovinum-074221813.html |work=in.news.yahoo.com |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\n===Tamil films===\nS Janaki sang her first Tamil song in 1957. The song ''Singaravelane Deva'' from the movie ''Konjum Salangai'' brought her to limelight in Tamil films. [[M. S. Viswanathan|M S Viswanathan]] gave her many hit songs every year throughout 60s and early 70s. It was the song ''Unnidathil ennaik kodutthen'' [[Avalukendru Oru Manam]] (1971) that consolidated her position as the most promising singer thereafter.\n\nShe sang many songs under many famous composers. [[Ilaiyaraaja]] - [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SP Balasubramanyam]]- S Janaki combination gave hit after hit from mid 1970s till 1990s. S Janaki is the only singer who has won state awards under the oft-called top three music composers of the state ([[M. S. Viswanathan|MS Vishwanathan]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and [[A. R. Rahman|AR Rahman]]).\n\nSome of her best solos in Tamil cinema are:\n* \"Singara Velane deva\" [[Konjum Salangai]] (1962)\n* \n*Sendhoora Poove\" [[16 Vayathinile]] (1977)\n* \"Kuyile Kavikkuyile\" [[Kavikkuyil]] (1977)\n* \"Annakkili Unnai\" [[Annakkili]] (1976)\n* \"Kaatril Endhan\" [[Johnny (1980 film)|Johnny]] (1980)\n* \"Ponmeni Urugudhe\" [[Moondram Pirai]] (1982)\n*\"Azhagu Malaraada\"''[[Vaidhegi Kaathirunthaal]]'' (1984) \n*\n* \"Chinna Chinna Vannakuyil\" [[Mouna Ragam]] (1986)\n* \"Ooru Sanam\" [[Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu]] (1986)\n*\n* \"Chinna Thayaval\" [[Thalapathi]] (1991)\n* \"Aasai Athigam Vechu''\"[[Marupadiyum]](1993)''\n*Margazhi Thingal Allava\" [[Sangamam]] (1999)\n\n===Telugu films===\nS Janaki started her career in Telugu films in 1957. Movies like ''Bava maradalu'', ''Pooja Phalam'' and ''Bangaru Panjaram'' had songs by S Janaki which were immensely popular. She gave continuous hits throughout 1960s and 70s. She continued to give hits till mid 90s. S Janaki has won 12 Nandi awards, 10 for films and 2 for television serial songs.A few of her solos are:\n\n* \"Neeli Meghalalo\" Bava Maradallu (1961)\n* \"Naravara O Kuruvara\" [[Nartanasala]] (1963)\n* \"Pagale Vennela\" [[Pooja Phalam]] (1964)\n* \"Pagalaite Doravera\" [[Bangaru Panjaram]] (1970)\n* \"Sirimallepoova\" [[Padaharella Vayasu]] (1978)\n* \"Nemaliki Nerpina\" [[Saptapadi]] (1981)\n* \"Om Namah Shivaaya\" [[Sagara Sangamam]] (1983)\n* \"Ee Dhuryodhana\" [[Pratighatana]] (1985)\n* \"Narudaa O Narudaa\" [[Bhairava Dweepam]] (1994)\n\n===Hindi films===\nComposer [[Bappi Lahiri]] was impressed by a Hindi song sung by S Janaki for a Tamil movie, when he visited [[Prasad Studios|Prasad Studio]]. He decided to have songs sung by her in his upcoming Hindi movies and introduced her to Bollywood.<ref name=\"YouTube\"/> She sang many duets with [[Kishore Kumar]].\n\nSome of her notable Hindi songs are\n* \"Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Aayaa jab se tu dil mein\" [[Jhoothi]] (1985)\n* \"Jawan Hai Dil Jawan Hain Hum\" [[Saaheb]] (1985)\n* \"Sun Rubia Tumse Pyar Ho Gaya\" [[Mard (1985 film)|Mard]] (1985)\n* \"Mamla Gadbad Hai\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Aankhen do\" [[Dharm Adhikari]] (1986)\n* \"Tune mera doodh piya\" [[Aakhree Raasta]] (1986)\n* \"Pag Paadam\" [[Naache Mayuri]](1986)\n* \"Dil mein ho tum\" [[Satyamev Jayate (film)|Satyamev Jayate]] (1987)\n* \"Main tere liye\" [[Main Tere Liye]] (1989)\n* \"Poocho Na Kysa Maza\" [[Awwal Number]] (1990)\n\n===Oriya films===\nS Janaki sang many evergreen songs in Oriya. She has sung about 68 songs in Odia films. Her songs are still popular today and she also won 1 [[Orissa State Film Award]].\n\n===Other languages===\n\nS Janaki sang songs in 17 languages, though her top hits were in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.  She also sang a few songs in other languages. 109 Hindi songs, 68 Odia songs, 4 Sinhalese songs, 2 Tulu songs, 1 Badaga song, 2 Sanskrit songs, 1 Punjabi song...\n* One Japanese song in [[Adutha Veettu Penn]] (1960)\n* One German song in [[Puthu Paatu]] (1990)\n* One English song in [[Swayamkrushi]] (1986).\n\n==Collaboration with Music Directors==\n\nS Janaki has worked with music directors of different generations. From the early 1960s she was given songs by composers mainly in Kannada and Malayalam films.Though she sang fewer songs in Telugu and Tamil during the beginning of her career she went on to rule the playback industry across all four south Indian languages from mid 1970s.\n\n===G. K. Venkatesh===\n[[G. K. Venkatesh]] was one of the early composers who brought a renaissance in Kannada film music.\nHe started composing for more films from early 1960s and went on to give some remarkable songs to Janaki. GKV-SJ-PBS combination was the talk of the town those days.\nTwo songs which need special mention from this combination are \"nambide ninna naadhadevate\" from Sandhya Raga and \"Karedaru kelade\" from Sanaadi Appanna: both became very popular.\n\n===Ilaiyaraaja===\n[[Ilaiyaraaja]] knew about Janaki's vocal range and versatility when he worked with G K Venkatesh. When he got a chance to compose music for his debut film [[Annakkili]] (1976) he made Janaki sing 3 songs which became immensely popular thus beginning an era in Tamil cinema. This combination churned out hits after hits pushing S Janaki to the numero uno position for at least the next 2 decades. S Janaki won 4 state awards in Tamil in his compositions. He explored her voice in wide variety of songs and she became the first choice for songs with village background.\n\nShe sang maximum duets with Balasubramanium, Malaysia Vasudevan, Mano, Yesudas, Jayachandran. Ilayaraaja himself sang around 200 duets with Janaki; most were chart busters. After IR started giving more songs to SJ, even other music composers followed by making her sing their top hits.\n\nSPB-IR-SJ created some of the finest duets of Tamil cinemas. 1980s saw the meteoric rise of Janaki with a strong back up from Ilayaraja, as she sang his songs in all four South Indian languages.\n\n===M. S. Baburaj===\nThe earliest recognised collaboration of S Janaki's was with the Malayalam composer [[MS Baburaj]], who specialised in Hindustani music. Under his direction, Janaki was able to give voice to some of Kerala's best loved film songs of all time during the 1960s and early 1970s. The songs they've worked on have been known for their outward expressions, both in voice and the composition by itself. Some of Janaki's best known solos come from this collaboration, including ''Vasantha Panchami Naalil'' ([[Bhargavi Nilayam]]), ''Anjana Kannezhuthi'' ([[Thacholi Othenan]]), and ''Thaane Thirinjum Marinjum'' ([[Ambalapravu]]).\n\n===Rajan\u2013Nagendra===\nRajan and Nagendra have a unique place in hearts of Kannada music lovers.\nS Janaki was a part of almost all their albums. During the initial days, RN gave many duets to PBS-SJ. Later their main singers were SPB and S Janaki.  Almost all of their songs remain etched as the unforgettable melodies of Kannada Cinema. The romantic duets that came out from the SPB-S Janaki-[[Rajan-Nagendra]] combination are considered to be heavenly and evergreen. Radios called the pair of SPB and S Janaki as \"Love Birds\" and are termed to be the \"Best singing pair\" in Kannada cinema, owing mainly to their romantic duets composed by Rajan-Nagendra in the 1970s and 80s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjanaki.net/kannada/with-spb|title=sjanaki.net|website=www.sjanaki.net}}</ref>\nIn terms of numbers it was Rajan-Nagendra who gave maximum songs to Janaki after Ilaiyaraaja. \nThe solos and duets that S Janaki rendered under these music composers can never be erased from the minds of Kannada audience. Some top hit songs came from movies such as Eradu Kanasu, Hombisilu,  Gaali Maathu, Pavana Ganga, Avala Hejje, Chandana Gombe,  Naa Ninna Bidalare and the list continues.\n\n===Hamsalekha===\nBy the end of 80s [[Hamsalekha]] established himself as the top music composer in Kannada cinema pushing all the veteran composers to the background. His strong association with actor Ravichandran resulted in so many hit songs. S Janaki was his first choice during the initial days of his career. SPB-SJ-HL created some of the evergreen duets in movies like [[Premaloka]] and [[Ranadheera]].\nS Janaki worked in more than 40 films with Hamsalekha and sang all-time hit solos and duets.\n\n===Vijaya Bhaskar===\nKannada cinema offered SJ real gems of her singing career and [[Vijaya Bhaskar]] is no exception. Though his main singers were P Susheela in 60s and Vani Jayaram and Chitra in 70s and 80s, he gave some of his best compositions to S Janaki in movies like [[Gejje Pooje]], [[Bellimoda]], [[Upasane]], [[Seetha (1970 film)]]; he chose her whenever the song needed some special singing. \"Gaganavu ello bhoomiyu ello\" remains one of the most memorable songs of S Janaki. If we take the top 10 songs of S Janaki in Kannada cinema there would definitely be at least 2 songs composed by Bhaskar.\n\n===A. R. Rahman===\nDuring 90's Janaki sang many great Tamil songs for [[A.R.Rahman|A. R. Rahman]] at the early stage of his career. Songs like \"Ottagatha Kattiko\", \"Gopala Gopala\", \"Nenjinele\", \"Kadhal Kaditham Theetave\", \"Mudhalvane\", \"Kathirika\", \"Endhan Nenjil\", \"Margazhi Thinkal\" and many are still popular. She won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback]] for Margazhi Thinkal allava from the film [[Sangamam]] under his composition.\n\n==Legacy & popularity==\nJanaki and voice modulation is synonymous. She has done a wide range of voice modulation according to the age of the character in all four South Indian languages.\nShe is perhaps the only singer who won state awards for the same. Tamil Nadu state award for \"Poda poda pokka\" song from [[Uthiripookkal]] (1978) and Andhra Pradesh State award for \"Govullu tellana\" song from [[Saptapadi (1981 film)]]. Songs she sang in kids-voice in 70s in Kannada too were popular, one such song is \"Thayiya thandeya\" from the film [[Madhura Sangama]](1978). She sang many such songs for 3 year old, young boy, goatish voice, male voice and voice of aged woman. She sung more than 100 such songs across all languages.\n\n===Toughest song===\nJanaki says that the toughest song of her singing career is the fastest swaras [[Kannada]] song \"Shiva shiva ennada naaligeyeke\" from the movie ''[[Hemavathi_(film)]]''. The song, which is in two different ragas, ''Thodi'' and ''Aabhogi'', was composed by L. Vaidyanathan.<ref name=\"dbsjeyaraj.com\">{{cite web|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/15504|title=South Indian Singer S.Janaki Explains why She is not Accepting the \"Padma

Their repertoire ranges from classic country to western swing, gypsy jazz to bluegrass, and old-time string band to contemporary folk (including some original gems).\n\nCathy & Marcy have performed at hundreds of bluegrass and folk festivals and taught at close to 100 music camps worldwide.
