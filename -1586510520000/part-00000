It was developed by Rupert Lissner for [[Apple Computer]], originally for the [[Apple II]] platform and launched in 1984, and was later reworked for the Macintosh platform.\n\nThe Apple subsidiary [[Claris]] created the new successor '''ClarisWorks''' for [[Apple IIGS]] (1988), [[Macintosh]] (1991), and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (1993). Those applications don't share any code with the 8-bit Apple II original. Apple absorbed Claris and the name ClarisWorks was changed to AppleWorks. It was bundled with all consumer-level Macintoshes sold by Apple until its discontinuation. As of 2007, AppleWorks had not been updated in several years and was unable to run on the Intel processors shipping in new Macs. On August 15, 2007, Apple announced AppleWorks had reached [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life status]], and would no longer be sold.<ref name=\"discontinued\">{{cite news| url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/news/index.cfm?RSS&NewsID=18827 | title=Apple cans AppleWorks | first=Jonny | last=Evans | date=August 15, 2007 | accessdate=August 15, 2007 | work=[[Macworld UK]]}}</ref> Apple instead promoted its recently launched [[iWork]] suite as a replacement, which contains word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications with capabilities similar to AppleWorks, but is not directly compatible with AppleWorks file formats.\n\n==History==\n=== AppleWorks (Apple II, 1984\u20131991) ===\nDeveloped by Rupert Lissner,<ref name=\"incider198609\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/inCider_1986-09#page/n15/mode/2up | title=Extras for the //x | work=inCider | date=September 1986 | accessdate=2 July 2014 |author1=de Peyster, Deborah |author2=Statt, Paul | page=14}}</ref> the original AppleWorks is one of the first integrated [[office suite]]s for personal computers, featuring a word processor, spreadsheet, and database merged into a single program. It was released in 1984 as a demonstration product for the new 128k models of the [[Apple II]] line. Apple had previously published Lissner's QuickFile, a database program that closely resembled what would become the AppleWorks database module. An [[Apple III]] version of AppleWorks, which uses the same file formats, is named III E-Z Pieces and was marketed by Haba Systems.\n\nAll three AppleWorks programs have the same user interface and exchange data through a common [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]].{{r|renne19841210}} Previous Apple II application programs had mainly been designed with the older II/II+ line in mind, which only has 48k of RAM and 40-column text without an add-on card, thus limiting the software capabilities. In contrast, Appleworks was designed for the IIe and IIc models which have more RAM, standard 80-column text, an optional numeric keypad, cursor keys, and the new ProDOS operating system in place of DOS 3.3 which had been standard on 48k machines.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAppleWorks debuted at #2 on [[Softalk]]'s monthly bestseller list and quickly became the best-selling software package on any computer, ousting even [[Lotus 1-2-3]] from the top of the industry-wide sales charts.<ref>[http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html Apple II History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404145851/http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html |date=April 4, 2005 }} AppleWorks page: Apple's \"Promotion\" of AppleWorks (Retrieved on June 13, 2009)</ref> Apple's software subsidiary Claris sold the one millionth copy of AppleWorks in December 1988.{{r|keizer198903}}\n\nApple and Lissner provided technical information on modifying AppleWorks, helping to create a substantial market for third-party accessories and support.

ClarisWorks 4 requires a 68020 CPU and System 7. When the Claris company was disbanded and absorbed back into Apple, the product was renamed AppleWorks;<ref name=\"cw-by-bob\" /> version 5 was released shortly before the product's return to Apple and was briefly called ClarisWorks 5. ClarisWorks/AppleWorks 5 requires MacOS 7.0.1, though the 5.0.4 patch can only be applied in Mac OS 9. It is the last version to support the 68k CPU architecture.\n\nThe last version, AppleWorks 6, requires a PowerPC CPU and replaces the communications module with a [[presentation software|presentation]] module (in prior versions there was only rudimentary support for presentations through the other modules).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It was also [[porting|ported]] to the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon API]] to work on Mac OS X, but as an early Carbon application, it does not take advantage of many of the newer features of Mac OS X and portions of the interface still retain elements of the Platinum appearance of Mac OS 8/9.\n\nUsing Claris's [[XTND]] framework, AppleWorks can create, open, and save files in a number of file formats. For example, word processor documents can be saved in [[Microsoft Word]] format, and spreadsheet files can be saved in [[Microsoft Excel]] format.\n\nThe software received good reviews{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} during the course of its lifespan for its interface and the tight integration of its modules. For example, like the earlier versions, in AppleWorks a drawing \"frame\" can be placed in a spreadsheet document, a paint frame can be placed in a drawing document, etc. This allows for very elaborate and data-rich layouts. However, the limitations of the product became more apparent as the product aged {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. The program also only allows for a single undo/redo, and in many cases, if a frame from one module is placed in another module, the frame may no longer be editable in any way as soon as it is deselected.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEquation Editor by Design Science is bundled with AppleWorks. Also, the [[MathType]] or [[MathMagic]] equation editors can be used. Both support automatic baseline alignment for inline equations.\n\n===Discontinuation===\nIn August 2007, Apple declared AppleWorks \"end of life\" and stated that they would no longer sell the package.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/rip-appleworks/|title=RIP AppleWorks|last=Jade|first=Charles|date=August 15, 2007|work=Ars Technica|access-date=December 3, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref> The [[iWork]] package, which includes a word processing program, a spreadsheet, and a presentation graphics program, is intended to be its replacement.

The name was changed to [[AppleWorks]] when Apple brought development of the product in-house. It was later bundled with all consumer-level Macintoshes sold by Apple until its discontinuation.

It was released in 1984 as a demonstration product for the new 128k models of the [[Apple II]] line. Apple had previously published Lissner's QuickFile, a database program that closely resembled what would become the AppleWorks database module.

In contrast, Appleworks was designed for the IIe/IIc models which had more RAM, standard 80-column text, an optional numeric keypad, cursor keys, and the new ProDOS operating system in place of DOS 3.3 which had been standard on 48k machines.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAppleWorks debuted at #2 on [[Softalk]]'s monthly bestseller list and quickly became the best-selling software package on any computer, ousting even [[Lotus 1-2-3]] from the top of the industry-wide sales charts.<ref>[http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html Apple II History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404145851/http://apple2history.org/history/ah19.html |date=April 4, 2005 }} AppleWorks page: Apple's \"Promotion\" of AppleWorks (Retrieved on June 13, 2009)</ref> Apple's software subsidiary Claris sold the one millionth copy of AppleWorks in December 1988.{{r|keizer198903}}\n\nApple and Lissner provided technical information on modifying AppleWorks, helping to create a substantial market for third-party accessories and support.

In fact, ClarisWorks was written from scratch and then redesigned to match other Claris programs after the purchase by Claris.<ref name=\"cw-by-bob\"/>\n\nClarisWorks 1.0 shipped for the Macintosh in 1991 and was subsequently ported to the Windows platform, shipping as ClarisWorks 1.0 for Windows in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} ClarisWorks 3 is the last version to run on the 68000 CPU with at least System 6.0.7. ClarisWorks 4 requires a 68020 CPU and System 7. When the Claris company was disbanded and absorbed back into Apple, the product was renamed AppleWorks;<ref name=\"cw-by-bob\" /> in fact, version 5 was released shortly before the product's return to Apple and was briefly called ClarisWorks 5. ClarisWorks/AppleWorks 5 requires MacOS 7.0.1, though the 5.0.4 patch can only be applied in Mac OS 9. It is the last version to support the 68k CPU architecture.\n\nThe last version, AppleWorks 6, requires a PowerPC CPU and replaces the communications module with a [[presentation software|presentation]] module (in prior versions there was only rudimentary support for presentations through the other modules).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It was also [[porting|ported]] to the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon API]] to work on Mac OS X, but as an early Carbon application, it does not take advantage of many of the newer features of Mac OS X and portions of the interface still retain elements of the Platinum appearance of Mac OS 8/9.\n\nUsing Claris' [[XTND]] framework, AppleWorks can create, open, and save files in a number of file formats. For example, word processor documents can be saved in [[Microsoft Word]] format, and spreadsheet files can be saved in [[Microsoft Excel]] format.\n\nThe software received good reviews{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} during the course of its lifespan for its interface and the tight integration of its modules. For example, like the earlier versions mentioned above, in AppleWorks a drawing \"frame\" can be placed in a spreadsheet document, a paint frame can be placed in a drawing document, etc. This allows for very elaborate and data-rich layouts. However, the limitations of the product became more apparent as the product aged {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. The program also only allows for a single undo/redo, and in many cases, if a frame from one module is placed in another module, the frame may no longer be editable in any way as soon as it is deselected.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEquation Editor by Design Science is bundled with AppleWorks. Also, the [[MathType]] or [[MathMagic]] equation editors can be used. Both support automatic baseline alignment for inline equations.\n\n==The end of AppleWorks==\nIn August 2007, Apple declared AppleWorks \"end of life\" and stated that they would no longer sell the package.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/rip-appleworks/|title=RIP AppleWorks|last=Jade|first=Charles|date=August 15, 2007|work=Ars Technica|access-date=December 3, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref> The [[iWork]] package, which includes a word processing program, a spreadsheet, and a presentation graphics program, is intended to be its replacement.

The crack in the road pavement was then repaired with fresh asphalt. {{As of|2020|04|09}}, the root cause of the bridge collapse is still unknown but a small event may have triggered a more important one, compromising the structural stability of the bridge. \n\n===Construction===\n\n[[Attilio Muggia]], a pioneer of [[reinforced concrete]] in Italy, built the bridge on the Magra river for connecting Albiano with Caprigliola and [[Tuscany]] with [[Liguria]].<ref name =\"News1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.news1.news/a/2020/04/collapsed-bridge-it-was-from-1908-it-was-built-by-a-pioneer-of-reinforced-concrete.html|title=Collapsed bridge: it was from 1908, it was built by a pioneer of reinforced concrete|date=9 April 2020|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Levantenews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.levantenews.it/index.php/2020/04/09/aulla-un-crollo-deja-vu/|title=Aulla: a collapse d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name =\"Voceapuana_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voceapuana.com/lunigiana-e-apuane/attualita/-il-ponte-costruito-da-mio-nonno-era-sopravvissuto-alle-mine-tedesche-27210.aspx|title=\"Il ponte costruito da mio nonno, era sopravvissuto alle mine tedesche\"|date=8 April 2020|work=La Voce Apuana|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge construction began in 1906 and was achieved in October 1908.

In a letter dated of August 2019, thus before the discovery of a crack in the asphalt of the road in November 2019, Vincenzo Marzi, then head of the ANAS department for Tuscany replied them that \"The viaduct for the moment does not present criticalities such as to compromise its static functionality\".<ref name=\u201dEuronews_2\u201d>[https://www.news1.news/a/2020/04/ponte-collapsed-who-is-the-anas-manager-who-signed-the-letter-of-tutto-a-posto.html Ponte collapsed, who is the Anas manager who signed the letter of \u201cTutto a posto\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Root causes of the disaster==\n\nAlthough the root causes of the collapse are not yet identified, some conjectures have already been put forwards by some experts. Indeed, ''Voce Apuana'' reports that the engineer Fabrizio Ferrari, nephew of Nino Ferrari who constructed the bridge together with Professor Muggia between 1906 and 1908, told CDS that: {{Quote|text=\"His impression is that there has been a break due to a cut of a section of the deck at a support.

Offices subsequently opened in The Hague (the Netherlands) and Ch\u00e2tel-Saint-Denis (Switzerland).\n\nThe company spent its early days developing the concept of dynamically positioned (DP) subsea pipelay. Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier \u201cNatalie Bolten\u201d in 1985 and converted it for DP pipelay at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/lorelay/ Lorelay]'' in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/swan-revival-means-1200-jobs-1340756.html|title=Swan revival means 1,200 jobs|website=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> ''Lorelay'' immediately entered service and successfully executed her first pipelay contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.\n\nIn 1987, the company declared its intention to build a vessel capable of lifting entire offshore platforms. The initial idea featured two rigidly connected, self-propelled supertankers, with a large slot at the bows to install platform topsides in one piece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-18/in-this-issue/general-interest/major-deepwater-pipelay-vessel-starts-work-in-north-sea.html|title=Major deepwater pipelay vessel starts work in North Sea|website=www.ogj.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company established itself a major player in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In 1992, the company acquired the former bulkhead carrier \u201cTrenchwood\u201d for conversion to ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/solitaire/ Solitaire],'' the world's largest pipelay vessel. Allseas awarded the conversion contract to Sembawang Shipyards in Singapore on a lump sum basis; however, due to ongoing problems the contract was terminated in 1995.

According to tradition, they were Roman virgins who were persecuted by [[Emperor Diocletian]] and fled eastwards. Among them were [[Hripsime|St. Hripsime]], St. Gayane, St. Shoghakat, St. Nune, and others with various saints up to 40 women. One of them, Nune, founded the Georgian Church. The virgins first worship at the Christ's sacred places (holy sites of Palestine) and then cross [[Edessa]] to Greater Armenia, settling near the capital of [[Vagharshapat]] in the tents. Tiridates, after seeing the beauty of young Christian virgin, wants to marry Hripsime, but she refuses.

According to the folk traditions, the disease is considered to have made Tiridates into a swine. The king's sister, Khosrovidukht, repeatedly dreamed that Tirdates could only be treated by Grigor, who was a prisoner in Artashat. He is released from prison and solemnly admitted to the capital Vagharshapat. Gregory first summons the souls of the martyred virgins, then preaches the religion of Christianity for 66 days and then healed the king. Tiridates III and the whole court is baptized; Christianity proclaimed a state religion.\n\nThis tradition, albeit romantic, is considered to be a legend \u2014 Adopting Christianity was merely part of Tiridates' extensive policy of creating an Armenia independent both from Persia and Rome.<ref name=\"\u0531\u0563\u0561\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0563\u0565\u0572\u0578\u057d\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Richard|first=Hovannisian|url=https://books.google.am/books/about/The_Armenian_People_From_Ancient_to_Mode.html?id=p37O_KtaUKsC&redir_esc=y|title=The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century|date=1997-08-14|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-10168-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hakobyan|first=Aleqsan|url=https://www.academia.edu/34569879/ARMENIA_AND_CHRISTIAN_CAUCASUS|title=ARMENIA AND CHRISTIAN CAUCASUS|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Persecution by Christians ===\nAfter the embracement of Christianity, more than half of the armenian population was still Hetanist.

He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky.

It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself. These holy trees are adorned with ribbons and handkerchiefs symbolising one's requests to the gods.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}}\n\nBesides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the [[Metsamor Castle]] (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, the [[Erebuni Fortress]] (eighth century BCE), [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit]] (fourth to second millennium BCE) and [[Zorats Karer]] (third millennium BCE), and the mountains.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275\u2013277}} Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\n=== Holidays ===\nThe Arordiners celebrate a number of holidays:{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} Terendez, Zatik, Hambardzum, [[Vardavar]] and Khaghoghorhnek. To these holy days they add a holy day for the remembrance of ancestors (20 September), the Birth of Vahagn (21 March), the Birth of Mihr (22 December) and the Navasard, the New Year celebrated in August.\n\n== Poetry and legends ==\nSeveral hetanist legends and poems have survived till our days.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Hetanism}}\n{{short description|Armenian Neopaganism}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{sidebar\n|name = Armenian Native Faith\n|title = [[Hetanism]]<br />and [[Armenian mythology]]\n|image = [[File:Left-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign UC 058E SVG.svg|150px]]\n|caption = Arevakhach, symbol of hetanism\n|captionstyle = font-style:italic\n|headingstyle = background:#B0CBAC\n|contentclass = hlist\n\n|heading1 = Practices\n|content1 =\n* [[Pantheism]]\n* Semi-[[Polytheistic]] [[Monotheism]]\n* [[Matagh]]\n* [[Knunk]]\n* [[Vardavar]]\n* [[Fire worship]]\n* [[List of water deities|Water woship]]\n* [[Veneration of the dead|Worship of ancestors]]\n\n|heading2 = Places\n|content2 =\n* [[Garni temple]]\n* [[Zorats qarer]]\n* [[Khustup mountain]]\n\n|heading3 = Deities and beings\n|content3 =\n* Ar\n* [[Hayk]] (Aramazd)\n* [[Anahit]]\n* [[Vahagn]]\n* [[Tir]]\n* [[Mihr]]\n* [[Vanatur]]\n* [[Ara the Beautiful]]\n* [[Turk' Angegh]]\n* [[Nane]]\n* [[Astghik]]\n* [[Spandaramet]]\n* [[Barshamin]]\n|heading4 = Ancient Sources\n|content4 =\n* [[Moses of Chorene]]\n* [[Anania Shirakatsi]]\n* [[Ukhtagirq]]\n\n}}\n'''Hetanism''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0540\u0565\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 ''Hetanosutiwn'') or '''Armenian native faith''', was the dominant<ref name=\"Romeny 2010\">{{Cite book|last=Romeny|first=R.

Varuzhan and his fellow intellectualists organized the first Armenian hetanist group/organization - ''Mehian,'' which printed articles about armenian nationalism and Hetanism. According to the ideology of Varuzhan and his followers, the Christian ideology of \"[[Turn the other cheek|turning the cheek]]\" has become a disaster for the Armenian nation, which before was a great nation with brave soldiers and wise rulers. According to them, the Armenian nation fell low after the acceptance of Christianity and became a slave to the west and the east.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Garegin Nzhdeh ===\n[[File:Garegin_Nzhdeh_5.jpg|thumb|Garegin Nzhdeh, the ideologue of an Armenian \"national religion\".]]\n\n[[Garegin Nzhdeh]] is considered one of the most important figures of the armenian history. He was a philosopher, statesman and ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of [[Armenia]], and is still one of the driving forces of [[Armenian nationalism]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} People praised him as the \"prophet of the Armenians\".{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=266}} Nzhdeh founded a movement named ''[[Tseghakron]]'' (\"religion of the nation\"), which was among the core doctrines of the [[Armenian Youth Federation]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] upholding the ordered world,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}} and praised [[Hayk]], the mythical patriarch of the [[Armenians]], and [[Vahagn]], the fire and warrior god \"[[Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or serpent|fighter of the serpent]]\", and believed Hetanism would awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=105}}\n\nThe first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (or \"Ara\"; ''Arordineri Ukht'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard) Kakosyan (1936\u20132005).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]]; in 1979 he fled to the [[United States]] where he became familiar with the ideas of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] (1886\u20131955).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=105|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}}\n\nAccording to modern hetanists, Garegin Nzhdeh is [[Apotheosis|deified]] as an incarnation of Vahagn, the re-establisher of the true faith of the Armenians and of the armenian values.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106}}\n\n=== 1990s: Establishment of the Children of Ari ===\nThe hetanists re-emerged after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the soviet union]]. They began to hold rituals on traditional Armenian holidays. The [[Temple of Garni]] became the centre of the community, a council of priests was set up in order to manage the organisation and the rites.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=106, note 7}} During the 1990s, the group reached visibility in wider Armenian society.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} According to the scholar Yulia Antonyan, the emergence of the Armenian Native Faith is attributable to the same causes which led to the rise of other modern religious movements, but also [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements, in the other post-Soviet countries: The Armenian Native Faith represents the indigenous answer to the social and cultural upheavals which followed the collapse of Soviet society and of its atheist and materialist ideology.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=104}}\n\n=== Republican Party support and grassroots spread ===\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_13.jpg|thumb|An Arordiner priest.]]\n[[Ashot Navasardyan]] (1950\u20131997) and [[Andranik Margaryan]] (1949\u20132007), founding fathers of the [[Republican Party of Armenia]], were hetanists like many other members of the party and took part in the very first ritual at the Temple of Garni.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=270}} The Armenian government provides financial support for the Children of Ari.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} Arordiner festivals are celebrated in some regions with the support of local municipalities.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107, note 8}} Despite this strong link with the nationalist political scene, hetanism itself does not have a political orientation, and the priests are forbidden from joining any political party.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}}\n\nAlthough it started among the Armenian intellectual elites as a means to reawaken Armenian identity, in most recent times the Armenian Native Faith movement has expanded its contingent of adherents among the provincial and rural populations,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=107}} and among the [[Armenian diaspora]].{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} Besides the philosophical approach of the intellectuals, the common people are driven to the Armenian Native Faith by various reasons, ranging from [[mysticism]] to a sentimental devotion to the gods. Antonyan documented the case of a thirty-five years-old woman who believed to be [[Infertility|infertile]], and who joined the Armenian Native Faith movement after she allegedly became pregnant by praying to Anahit, goddess of fertility, and to Astghik, goddess of love and beauty.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108}} The woman gave her daughter the name \"Nana\", another name of the goddess of fertility.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}}\n\nLocal Arordiner communities have been organised in villages outside the capital [[Yerevan]]. The structure of the Order of the Children of Ari, and of the local communities themselves, is characterised by a clear hierarchy, with the council of priests, led by an elected chief, handling the organisation of all activities. The highest position within the hierarchy is that of the supreme priest, which has remained vacant since Slak Kakosyan's death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\n=== Theology and cosmology ===\n[[File:Aramazd.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of God Ar]]\n\n==== Ar and Ara ====\nThe theology of Hetanism is a [[monism]]: According to the faith, in the beginning was the Ar, who was the creator of the reality .{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} The Ar is the impersonal, without qualities, [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] principle begetting the universe, the universal ideal and a conscience.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=266}} According to Hetanists, ''Ar'' is the life-giving word root,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} and it is the origin of words like, for instance, ''art'' (\"arable\", \"cultivation\"; culture, art), ''aryyun'' (\"blood\"), ''argand'' (\"womb\"), ''armat'' (\"root\"), ''arka'' (\"king\"), ''ara'' (\"male\"), ''Arev'' (the Sun), ''Ara'' (manifested Ar), ''Ari'' (acting with Ar), ''Chari'' (opposing Ar).{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=115|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2p=271}} The \"essence of things\" and their \"perfection\" is represented by ''[[swastika]]'' motifs.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n==== Deities ====\nThe different deities are beneath the supreme Ar. They are not separate beings, but merely different manifestations of Ar. Though monotheistic in theology, the Armenian Native Faith is mostly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] in practice.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=116}} The gods of the Arordiners include:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Name\n! style=\"padding:0.5em 0.5em;white-space:nowrap;\" |Also known as\n!Details\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |[[Hayk]]\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aramazd, Khaldi\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The primary God of ancient armenians, head of the pantheon, manifestation of fatherhood, the earth and the sky. He was called almighty and all-father. His temple was in Kamakh, Ani province, which also was a grave for Armenian kings of the [[Artaxiad|artaxiad dynasty of Armenia.]] Along with Anahit and Vahagn contituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Anahit\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Teisheba\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Daughter of Aramazd. She was the mother god, and was pictured with a long veil coming down from her hair, she was referenced to as the great mother Anahit, the good-bringer, maifestation of motherhood and the personofication and mother-protector of Armenia. It is due to Anahit that the Armenian nation still exists and will continue to live. Armenian kings, before enacting decisions or going to wars would ask the goddess for approval and tips, to succee in what they plan. She was also the devine manifestation  and personofication of motherhood and fertility.\nTogether with Aramazd and Vahagn she constituted the holy triad.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Vahagn\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Aray, Demetr\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |The third God of the pantheon was Vahagn, who was described in ancient armenian poems as a bright and red-haired teen with fire-like hair and beard and eyes that shined like the sun. He is the dying and reborning God, who is born from the union of water and fire, soil and the sky. \nHe is the most popular Armenian God and is a notable figure in the armenian consicene even nowadays.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik\n| style=\"padding-left:1em;\" |Astghik, Astlik\n| style=\"padding:0.5em;\" |Astghik was the lover of Vahagn and was considered his polar opposite.

Contrary to other religions of the world, Armenains didn't have a conception of hell or bad Gods. All bad in the world comes from humanity, and the underground is root of life.\n\nArmenians consider holy the water, lions, apricot tree and fire.\n\n=== Afterlife and eschatology ===\nHetanists have a cyclical view of reality, and they believe in the [[reincarnation]] of individual souls through the genetic lineage. That is to say, men are believed to come back to life in the following generations of their own descendants, in the kin which they begot while living.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} According to hetanist doctrines, the entire world goes through similar cycles, from the smaller ones represented by the days and the years, to the greatest ones represented by eras of ten thousand years.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nThe struggle between light and dark unfolds through the cycle of each era: Order and connection with the ancestors prevail during the world's summer and spring; while disorder, confusion and forsaking of the ancestral roots prevail during the world's autumn and winter. In the latter period, beings are not in harmony with Ar, they are not nourished by cosmic energy. At the darkest stage of history, though, which according to Arordiners corresponds to the current times, Vahagn is born again and brings the warrior forces back to life.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n=== The ''Ukhtagirk'' ===\n''Ukhtagirk'', the holy book of the Armenian Native Faith, may be translated as \"Book of Vows\". It was the life work of Slak Kakosyan, who finished the manuscript just before his death in 2005.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} Kakosyan, however, is not the \"author\" of the ''Ukhtagirk'', but rather the \"recorder\" of oral traditions,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=115}} its \"compiler\" (''kazmogh'').{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}} The book was officially proclaimed the holy text of the Order of the Children of Ari in 2000, a couple of years before its completion, when the religious organisation was officially registered by the Armenian state.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271}}\n\nThe book is divided into seven parts: \u2460 ''Astvatsashoonch'' (\"Dictionary\"), which explains the Armenian language as a mystical system of symbols related to the root ''Ar''; \u2461 ''Tsagumnaran'' (\"Genesis\"), which explains in mythical terms the origin of the world, the gods and mankind; \u2462 ''Avetaran'' (\"Book of Testaments\") and \u2463 ''Dzonaran'' (\"Book of Odes\"), which deal with philosophical and ontological categories to explain reality and values; \u2464 ''Veharan'' (\"Book of Greatness\") and \u2465 ''Patgamaran'' (\"Book of Commandments\"), which present mythologised descriptions of Garegin Nzhdeh's life and ideas, respectively; and the seventh and last chapter, \u2466 ''Hymnergaran'' (\"Book of Hymns\"), which is a collection of poems written by Kakosyan and his followers, as well as by authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The mythological parts about creation rely upon Armenian medieval sources and folk knowledge.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=271\u2013272}}\n\nChanting ritual texts from the book is considered to procure mystical experiences, and the physical book itself is crucial for some ritual activities, such as wedding ceremonies, in which the rings are passed to the bride and groom on top of a copy of the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}} At the same time, Arordiners do not consider their book unquestionable, but the text is open to corrections as required by changing circumstances. This attitude is supported by a declaration of Slak Kakosyan himself, who conceived the book in the terms of a changeful and adaptable truth.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=273}}\n\n== Practices ==\n[[File:Hetan_priest_officiating_at_Garni_Temple,_Armenia_30.jpg|thumb|300x300px|People gathered on the occasion of a public ceremony at the Temple of Garni.]]\nArmenian Native Faith practices, rituals and representations mostly rely on the instructions given by the ''Ukhtagirk''.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110}} For instance, it is common for the priests to make pilgrimage to [[Khustup|Mount Khustup]], where, according to the book, Garegin Nzhdeh experienced the presence of the god Vahagn.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The priests' aim is to replicate such experience.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=109}} The veneration of Nzhdeh and the pilgrimage to his burial site, which is located on the slopes of the Khustup, is also slowly developing within the larger community of Hetanists.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=110, note 14}} In general, mountains are revered as holy, so, besides Khustup, other mountains, including [[Mount Ararat]] and [[Mount Aragats]], function as pilgrimage destination for hetanists.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|pp=275, 278}}\n\n=== Rituals ===\nArmenian Native Faith rituals include the yearly ceremonies performed on Armenian traditional holidays, and three [[rites of passage]]: The ''knunk'', a complex ritual of initiation; the ''psak'', that is wedding; and death rituals.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} The death rituals require the [[cremation]] of the body,{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=121}} and its return to the four elements. Fire is symbolised by the cremation itself; then the ashes are divided into three parts, of which one is buried in the earth, one is scattered in the air of the [[Garni Gorge]], and the third one is poured in the water of the Garni River.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}} Afterwards, the deceased is memorialised by the collective lighting of a torch.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=278}} The first Arordiner to be cremated was Kakosyan himself,when cremation is illegal in Armenia. Later, hetanists obtained by the state the right to cremate their dead.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=277}}[[File:Hetan_initiation_ritual_(0).PNG|thumb|Stage of a ''knunk'' ritual.|alt=|left]]The Armenian term ''knunk'' may be translated as \"conversion\" or \"reversion\" (to the native way of life).{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}} Yulia Antonyan observed that about ten to twenty people take part to each ''knunk'' ritual, which is held on the occasion of the public ceremonies at the Temple of Garni. At the same time, there are many hetanists who believe that in order to worship the native gods of Armenia it is not necessary to undergo an official conversion.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=108, note 11}}\n\n=== Temples and idols ===\nArordiner public ceremonies and rituals are held at ancient sacred places, which are often in ruins.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The re-appropriation of churches that were built on native sacred sites is also common.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} The most important of these sites is the first-century Temple of Garni, a temple which was rebuilt in 1975, which has become the main ceremonial center for the Armenian Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}}\n\nThe Arordiners have reconsecrated the temple to Vahagn, although historically it was dedicated to Mihr. They have also been given approval for the rearrangement of the compound, in order for it to match the ideal structure of ancient Armenian sanctuaries.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} They have added a holy spring dedicated to Slak Kakosyan and a wood of [[apricot]] trees, the holy tree of Armenian Native Faith. The temple is now organised into three sacred spaces: The first is the sacred spring, the second one is the temple proper, and the third one is the holy wood, located on a hillock.{{sfnm|1a1=Antonyan|1y=2010|1p=119|2a1=Siekierski|2a2=Antonyan|2y=2013|2pp=275\u2013277}} The rituals at the Temple of Garni take place following a route which starts from the spring, passes through the temple, and endly reaches the holy wood.{{sfn|Antonyan|2010|p=119}} Downhill, each newly established local Arordiner community plants a tree, symbolising the unity and well-being of the group itself.

After the arrogant [[Titan (mythology)|Titanid]] [[Belus (Babylonian)|Bel]] made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near [[Mount Ararat]]. Hayk relocated near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named ''Haykashen''. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of [[Lake Van]] and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Moses states that:<blockquote>\u201c Hayk was a handsome, friendly man, with curly hair, sparkling eyes, and strong arms. He was a man of giant stature, a mighty archer and fearless warrior. Hayk and his people, from the time of their forefathers [[Noah]] and [[Japheth]], had migrated south toward the warmer lands near Babylon. In that land there ruled a wicked giant, Bel. Bel tried to impose his tyranny upon Hayk's people. But proud Hayk refused to submit to Bel. As soon as his son Aramaniak was born, Hayk rose up and led his people northward into the land of [[Ayrarat|Ararad]]. At the foot of the mountain he built a village and gave it his name, calling Haykashen. \u201d</blockquote>Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as [[Dastakert]]), with the king in the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]].\n\nAt ''Dyutsaznamart'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: \u0534\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0561\u0566\u0576\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u057f, \"Battle of Giants\"), near [[Julamerk]] southeast of [[Lake Van]], on 11 August 2492 BC (according to the Armenian traditional chronology of the first month of the [[Armenian calendar]], Navasard or 2107 BC (according to \"The Chronological table\" of [[Mikael Chamchian]]), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray.\n\nThe hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named ''Gerezmank'' meaning \"tombs\". He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.\n\nSoon after, Hayk established the fortress of [[Haykaberd]] at the battle site and the town of Haykashen in the Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] (modern-day Turkey). He named the region of the battle ''Hayk'', and the site of the battle Hayots Dzor.\n\n=== Ara the handsome ===\nAnother ancient Armenian legend is connected with Ara the beautiful, God of spring and rebirth.\n\nAccording to the legend, Shamiram had fallen in love with the handsome Ara and asked him to marry her. When Ara refused, Semiramis, in the heat of passion, gathered the armies of [[Assyria]] and marched against Armenia. During the battle Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Shamiram, reputed to be a sorceress, took his body and prayed to the gods to raise Ara from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Shamiram disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. Nevertheless, Ara is reborn later and gets his revenge on the Assyrian queen.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was also reported that a village called Lezk, near [[Van, Turkey|Van]], traditionally held that it was Ara's place of resurrection.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Torq Angegh ===\nTorq was considered one of [[Hayk]]'s great-grandsons and reportedly represented as an unattractive male figure. He is mentioned by Armenian 5th Century historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] and considered one of the significant deities of the Armenian pantheon. Taken in the context of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] religions, it is conceivable that an etymological connection with [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]]/Tyr is more than a simple coincidence. According to tradition, with his immense strength he threw rocks at the invading Greek navy, keeping the shores of Armenia safe.\n\n== Relations with Christianity ==\n[[File:\u054a\u0561\u0580_\u0533\u0561\u057c\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574.jpg|thumb|A ritual dance at the Temple of Garni.]]\nThe relations between the Armenian Native Faith movement and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have been good and collaborative, since both share the common interest of protecting and promoting Armenian identity, especially against what are perceived as disruptive foreign forces infiltrating the country, such as Protestants, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism|Mormons]].{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} The Armenian Apostolic Church generally sees Arordiners as allies. A high-ranking spokesman of the Armenian Apostolic Church declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian Church has an unequivocal stance on sectarians (i.e. Protestants et al.), but we do not interfere into hetanos affairs.}}\nSimilarly, the head of an Armenian institution catering to the victims of destructive cults declared:{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}}\n{{Quote|The Armenian nation must remember its pre-Christian past, and Ara's Children help them remember. They also support the Armenian Apostolic Church in its fight against destructive sects.}}\nArmenian Native Faith believers' attitude towards Christianity oscillates between two positions: The critique of the religion's role in Armenian history, and the conditional acceptance of the Armenian Apostolic Church as a national institution.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} Christianity is criticised for having destroyed the rich and highly developed ancient Armenian culture, replacing the values of courage, martial spirit and honour with those of humility, obedience and modesty, thus causing the collapse of Armenian statehood and condemning the nation to centuries of subordination to foreign powers, migrations, persecutions and massacres.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=268}} According to the strongest accusations, Christianity is responsible for the \"first genocide of the Armenians\", which coincided with its forceful introduction in the fourth century.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nAt the same time, the Armenian Apostolic Church is considered an institution peculiar to the Armenian nation, and the fruit of a synthesis of Christian and indigenous elements, in which the former represent just the surface. The hetanists find proof of this in the Church's prayers devoted to the Sun and light, in Church festivals overlapping indigenous Armenian festivals, and in the practice of ''matagh'', Christian animal sacrifice. Moreover, the hetanists believe that the Armenian alphabet, which Church historiography holds to have been invented by the monk Mesrop Mahtots, is actually an elaboration of ancient Armenian symbolism based on the motif of the ''[[swastika]]''.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\nHetanists generally do not have problems visiting Armenian churches and treating them as holy places, since many of them were built on the site of pre-Christian temples. Furthermore, some figures of the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church are revered as Hetanists in disguise: The ''[[Catholicos|catholicoi]]'' (high-ranking bishops) Vazgen I (in charge 1954\u20131994) and Garegin I (1995\u20131999). The former was a supporter of Nzhdeh and on his tombstone, instead of a cross, he has a letter of the Armenian alphabet which is considered a variant of the ''swastika'' and symbolic of seven Armenian gods. The latter is said to have visited Garni before his death and, despite being terminally ill, to have walked alone to the temple.{{sfn|Siekierski|Antonyan|2013|p=269}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n* {{cite contribution|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|last2=Antonyan|first2=Yulia|year=2013|contribution=A Neopagan Movement in Armenia: the Children of Ara|title=Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe|editor1=Kaarina Aitamurto|editor2=Scott Simpson|isbn=9781844656622|location=Durham|publisher=Acumen|pages=266\u2013282|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2010|title='Re-creation' of a Religion: Neo-paganism in Armenia|url=https://www.academia.edu/191429|journal=Laboratorium|language=ru|location=Saint-Petersburg|pages=103\u2013128|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|language=hy|archivedate=16 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201021/http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=|ref=harv|pages=23\u201330|isbn=9789993079934|first=Yulia|location=Yerevan|publisher=Lingva|url=http://old.brusov.am/docs/cank-Identity_Articles_final.pdf|title=Identities and Changing World, Proceedings of International Conference|contribution=The Aryan Myth and the New Armenian Paganism|year=2008|author-mask={{long dash}}|url-status=dead}}\n\n; Armenian neoshamanism\n\n* {{cite contribution|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|year=2008|contribution=Magical and Healing Practices in Contemporary Urban Environment (in Armenian Cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor|title=Figuring the South Caucasus: Societies and Environment|publisher=Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation|location=Tbilisi|isbn=9789941900914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2006|title=On the Name and Origins of 'Chopchi' Healing Practices|journal=Bulletin of Armenian Studies|pages=61\u201366|ref=harv|number=1}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Antonyan|first=Yulia|author-mask={{long dash}}|year=2003|title=Pre-Christian Healers in a Christian Society|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|volume=27|ref=harv|number=2}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://arordiukht.do.am/ Order of the Children of Ari] \u2014 official website\n* [http://www.hayary.org/ Armenian Aryan Congregation] \u2014 official website\n{{Neopaganism}}\n\n[[Category:Modern Pagan traditions]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Neopaganism by country]]\n[[Category:Religion in Armenia]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hetanism}}\n", "name_user": "Bdijkstra", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixingdisallowed DISPLAYTITLE modifications", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Native_Faith"}

This species is relatively small headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. It has a generally elongated, slender shape, sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark gray, rusty and whitish in color. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the species its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head, breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic. This colouration may come from dust-bathing, rubbing mud on its body or from drinking in mineral-rich waters. The tail feathers and wings are gray. The juvenile bird is dark black-brown over most of the body, with a buff-brown breast and takes five years to reach full maturity. The bearded vulture is silent, apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like ''cheek-acheek'' call made around the nest.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:NovitatesZoologicae18 532 Gypaetus barbatus nestling.png|Nestlings are covered in dark [[down feather]]s\nFile:Gypaetus-barbatus-bearded-vulture-0b.jpg|The juvenile bird is mostly dark\nFile:Bartgeier 0505262.jpg|The adult has a buff-yellow body and head\nFile:Lammergeier or Bearded Vulture, Gypaetus barbatus.

Large bones will be digested in about 24 hours, aided by slow mixing/churning of the stomach content. The high fat content of bone marrow makes the net energy value of bone almost as good as that of muscle, even if bone is less completely digested. A skeleton left on a mountain will dehydrate and become protected from bacterial degradation, and the bearded vulture can return to consume the remainder of a carcass even months after the soft parts have been consumed by other animals, larvae and bacteria.<ref name=\"acid\">{{cite journal\n| year= 1994 |journal=J.

The growing availability of firearms, combined with bounties offered for dead vultures, caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the Alps. By the beginning of the 20th century, they had completely disappeared from the Alpine regions.\n\nEfforts to reintroduce the bearded vulture began in earnest in the 1970s, in the French Alps. Zoologists Paul Geroudet and Gilbert Amigues attempted to release vultures that had been captured in Afghanistan, but this approach proved unsuccessful: it was too difficult to capture the vultures in the first place, and too many died in transport on their way to France. A second attempt was made in 1987, using a technique called \"hacking,\" by which young individuals (from 90\u2013100 days) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the Alps. As they were still unable to fly at that age, the chicks were hand-fed by humans until the birds learned to fly and were able to reach food without human assistance. This method has proven more successful, with over 200 birds released in the Alps from 1987 to 2015, and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the Alps.<ref>http://gypaetebarbu.ch/project/reintroduction, 31.5.2018, Pro Gypa\u00e8te</ref>\n\n== Threats and conservation status ==\n[[File:Lammergeier with boy, Kabul, 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|Boy with live bearded vulture, [[Kabul]]]]\nThe bearded vulture is one of the most endangered European bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bretagnolle |first1=Vincent |last2=Inchausti |first2=Pablo |last3=Seguin |first3=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |last4=Thibault |first4=Jean-Claude |title=Evaluation of the extinction risk and of conservation alternatives for a very small insular population: the bearded vulture ''Gypaetus barbatus'' in Corsica |journal=Biological Conservation |date=November 2004 |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201330 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.01.023 }}</ref> It naturally occurs at low densities, with anywhere from a dozen to 500 pairs now being found in each mountain range in Eurasia where the species breeds.

They are often found near [[Transhumance in the Alps|alpine pastures]] and [[Alpine tundra|meadows]], [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grassland]] and [[heath]], steep-sided, rocky [[wadi]]s, high [[steppe]] and are occasional around [[forest]]s. They seem to prefer desolate, lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones, such as [[gray wolf|wolves]] and [[golden eagle]]s, have healthy populations.\n\nIn [[Ethiopia]], they are now common at refuse tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns. Although they occasionally descend to {{convert|300|-|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} and normally reside above {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in some parts of their range.

The bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of Lesotho, Free State, Eastern Cape and Maloti-Drakensburg mountains in Kwa-Zulu Natal . Adult bearded vultures utilize areas with higher altitudes, with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites . Adult bearded vultures are more likely to fly below 200m over Lesotho.

This species is relatively small headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. It has a generally elongated, slender shape, sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark gray, rusty and whitish in color. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the species its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head, breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic. This colouration may come from dust-bathing, rubbing mud on its body or from drinking in mineral-rich waters. The tail feathers and wings are gray. The juvenile bird is dark black-brown over most of the body, with a buff-brown breast and takes five years to reach full maturity. The bearded vulture is silent, apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like ''cheek-acheek'' call made around the nest.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:NovitatesZoologicae18 532 Gypaetus barbatus nestling.png|Nestlings are covered in dark [[down feather]]s\nFile:Gypaetus-barbatus-bearded-vulture-0b.jpg|The juvenile bird is mostly dark\nFile:Bartgeier 0505262.jpg|The adult has a buff-yellow body and head\nFile:Lammergeier or Bearded Vulture, Gypaetus barbatus.

Large bones will be digested in about 24 hours, aided by slow mixing/churning of the stomach content. The high fat content of bone marrow makes the net energy value of bone almost as good as that of muscle, even if bone is less completely digested. A skeleton left on a mountain will dehydrate and become protected from bacterial degradation, and the bearded vulture can return to consume the remainder of a carcass even months after the soft parts have been consumed by other animals, larvae and bacteria.<ref name=\"acid\">{{cite journal\n| year= 1994 |journal=J.

The bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of {{convert|50|-|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below, which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> They can fly with bones up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighing over {{convert|4|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, or nearly equal to their own weight.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>\n\nAfter dropping the large bones, the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> This learned skill requires extensive practice by immature birds and takes up to seven years to master.<ref name=\"BBC-BeardedVulture\">{{cite web| work = Wildlife Finder|title=Lammergeier (video, facts and news)| publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/species/Bearded_Vulture| accessdate = 2011-05-29}}</ref> Its old name of ''ossifrage'' (\"bone breaker\") relates to this habit.

The growing availability of firearms, combined with bounties offered for dead vultures, caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the Alps. By the beginning of the 20th century, they had completely disappeared from the Alpine regions.\n\nEfforts to reintroduce the bearded vulture began in earnest in the 1970s, in the French Alps. Zoologists Paul Geroudet and Gilbert Amigues attempted to release vultures that had been captured in Afghanistan, but this approach proved unsuccessful: it was too difficult to capture the vultures in the first place, and too many died in transport on their way to France. A second attempt was made in 1987, using a technique called \"hacking,\" by which young individuals (from 90\u2013100 days) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the Alps. As they were still unable to fly at that age, the chicks were hand-fed by humans until the birds learned to fly and were able to reach food without human assistance. This method has proven more successful, with over 200 birds released in the Alps from 1987 to 2015, and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the Alps.<ref>http://gypaetebarbu.ch/project/reintroduction, 31.5.2018, Pro Gypa\u00e8te</ref>\n\n== Threats and conservation status ==\n[[File:Lammergeier with boy, Kabul, 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|Boy with live bearded vulture, [[Kabul]]]]\nThe bearded vulture is one of the most endangered European bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bretagnolle |first1=Vincent |last2=Inchausti |first2=Pablo |last3=Seguin |first3=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |last4=Thibault |first4=Jean-Claude |title=Evaluation of the extinction risk and of conservation alternatives for a very small insular population: the bearded vulture ''Gypaetus barbatus'' in Corsica |journal=Biological Conservation |date=November 2004 |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201330 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.01.023 }}</ref> It naturally occurs at low densities, with anywhere from a dozen to 500 pairs now being found in each mountain range in Eurasia where the species breeds. The species is most common in [[Ethiopia]], where an estimated 1,400 to 2,200 are believed to breed.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Relatively large, healthy numbers seem to occur in some parts of the Himalayas as well. It was largely wiped out in Europe, and by the beginning of the 20th century the only substantial population was in the Spanish and French Pyrenees. Since then, it has been successfully reintroduced to the [[Swiss]] and [[Italy|Italian]] Alps, from where they have spread over into [[France]].<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> They have also declined somewhat in parts of Asia and Africa, though less severely than in Europe.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>\n\nMany raptor species were shielded from anthropogenic influences in previously underdeveloped areas therefore they are greatly impacted as the human population rises and infrastructure increases in underdeveloped areas. The increase in human population and infrastructure results in the declines of the bearded vulture populations today. The increase of infrastructure includes the building of houses, roads and power lines and a major issue with infrastructure and bird species populations is the collision with power lines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|journal = PLOS ONE| year=2014| volume=9| issue=12| pages=e114920| title=Differential Range Use between Age Classes of Southern African Bearded Vultures ''Gypaetus barbatus''| author1=Kruger, Sonja| author2=Reid, Timothy| author3=Amar, Arjun|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0114920| pmid=25551614| pmc=4281122| bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k4920K}}</ref> The declines of the bearded vulture populations have been documented throughout their range resulting from a decrease in habitat space, fatal collisions with energy infrastructure, reduced food availability, poisons left out for carnivores and direct persecution in the form of Trophy Hunting.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\">{{cite web\n| title = Lammergeier\n| date = 2008-04-22\n| publisher = Discovery Communications\n| work = howstuffworks.com\n| url = http://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/lammergeier-info.htm\n| accessdate = 2011-05-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110712230041/http://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/lammergeier-info.htm| archivedate= 12 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThis species is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List last accessed on 1 October 2016, the population continues to decline as the distribution ranges of this species continues to decline due to human development.\n\n== Conservation action ==\n\nThere have been mitigation plans that have been established to reduce the population declines in bearded vulture populations.
