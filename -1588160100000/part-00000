The '''Battle of Dunkirk'''  ({{lang-fr|Bataille de Dunkerque|link=no}}) was fought in [[Dunkirk|Dunkirk (Dunkerque)]], [[French Third Republic|France]], during the [[Second World War]], between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. As the Allies were losing the [[Battle of France]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], the Battle of Dunkirk was the defence and evacuation to Britain of British and other Allied forces in Europe from 26 May to 4 June 1940.\n\nAfter the [[Phoney War]], the [[Battle of France]] began in earnest on 10 May 1940. To the east, the German [[Army Group B]] invaded the [[Netherlands]] and advanced westward. In response, the Supreme Allied Commander\u2014French General [[Maurice Gamelin]]\u2014initiated \"Plan D\" and entered [[Belgium]] to engage the Germans in the Netherlands. The plan relied heavily on the [[Maginot Line]] fortifications along the German\u2013French border, but German forces had already crossed through most of the Netherlands before the French forces arrived. Gamelin instead committed the forces under his command, three mechanised armies, the French [[French First Army|First]] and [[French Seventh Army|Seventh]] Armies and the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), to the [[Dyle (river)|River Dyle]]. On 14 May, German [[Army Group A]] burst through the [[Ardennes]] and advanced rapidly to the west toward [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], then turned northward to the [[English Channel]], using [[Field Marshal (Germany)|''Generalfeldmarschall'']] [[Erich von Manstein]]'s plan ''[[Manstein Plan#Sichelschnitt|Sichelschnitt]]''  under the German strategy [[Battle of France#Fall Gelb .28Case Yellow.29|Fall Gelb]], effectively flanking the Allied forces.<ref name=\"MacDonald 1986, p. 8\">MacDonald 1986, p. 8.</ref>\n\nA series of Allied counter-attacks\u2014including the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]]\u2014failed to sever the German spearhead, which reached the coast on 20 May, separating the BEF near [[Armenti\u00e8res]], the French [[First Army (France)|First Army]], and the [[Belgian Army]] further to the north from the majority of French troops south of the German penetration. After reaching the Channel, the German forces swung north along the coast, threatening to capture the ports and trap the British and French before they could evacuate to Britain.\n\nIn one of the most debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. Contrary to popular belief, what became known as the \"Halt Order\" did not originate with [[Adolf Hitler]]. ''[[Generaloberst]]en'' (Colonel-Generals) [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk [[pocket (military)|pocket]] should cease their advance on the port and consolidate to avoid an Allied breakout. Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]''. The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and build a defensive line. While more than 330,000 Allied troops were rescued,<ref>Frieser 2005, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> British and French military forces nonetheless sustained heavy casualties and were forced to abandon nearly all their equipment. The British Expeditionary Force alone lost some 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign.\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 10 May 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the United Kingdom. By 26 May, the BEF and the French 1st Army were bottled up in a corridor to the sea, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} deep and {{convert|15|mi|km|}} wide. Most of the British forces were still around [[Lille]], over {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Dunkirk, with the French farther south. Two massive German armies flanked them. General [[Fedor von Bock]]'s Army Group B was to the east, and General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]'s Army Group A to the west. Both officers were later promoted to field marshal.<ref name=\"MacDonald 1986, p. 8\"/>\n\n==Halt order==\n{{See also|Battle of Arras (1940)}}\n<!-- Sidebar starts here -->\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:298px; margin: 4px; padding: 0.5em;\"><center>'''Quotes on the halt order'''</center>\n\n{{quote|During the following days... it became known that Hitler's decision was mainly influenced by Goering.

Ellis]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The day's entry concludes with the remark: \"The task of Army Group A can be considered to have been completed in the main\"\u2014a view which further explains Rundstedt's reluctance to employ his armoured divisions in the final clearing-up stage of this first phase of the campaign.<ref>Butler 2009, p. 151.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Franz Halder]] wrote in his diary on 30 May:\n\n<blockquote>Brauchitsch is angry ... The pocket would have been closed at the coast if only our armour had not been held back. The bad weather has grounded the ''Luftwaffe'' and we must now stand and watch countless thousands of the enemy get away to England right under our noses.<ref>Shirer 1959, p. 883.</ref>\n</div>\n<!-- End of sidebar-->\n\nOn 24 May, Hitler visited General von Rundstedt's headquarters at [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|Charleville]]. The terrain around Dunkirk was thought unsuitable for armour.  Von Rundstedt advised him the infantry should attack the British forces at Arras, where the British had proved capable of significant action, while Kleist's armour held the line west and south of Dunkirk to pounce on the Allied forces retreating before Army Group B. Hitler, who was familiar with Flanders' marshes from the [[World War I|First World War]], agreed. This order allowed the Germans to consolidate their gains and prepare for a southward advance against the remaining French forces.\n\n''[[Luftwaffe]]'' commander [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] asked for the chance to destroy the forces in Dunkirk. The Allied forces' destruction was thus initially assigned to the air force while the German infantry organised in [[Army Group B]]. Von Rundstedt later called this \"one of the great turning points of the war.\"<ref name=\"Taylor and Mayer p. 60\">Taylor and Mayer 1974, p. 60.</ref><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 877.</ref><ref name=\"atkin1990\">Atkin 1990, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe true reason for the decision to halt the German armour on 24 May is still debated. One theory is that Von Rundstedt and Hitler agreed to conserve the armour for ''[[Fall Rot]]'' (\"Case Red\"), an operation to the south. It is possible that the Luftwaffe's closer ties than the army's to the Nazi Party contributed to Hitler's approval of G\u00f6ring's request. Another theory\u2014which few historians have given credence\u2014is that Hitler was still trying to establish diplomatic peace with Britain before [[Operation Barbarossa]] (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Although von Rundstedt after the war stated his suspicions that Hitler wanted \"to help the British\", based on alleged praise of the British Empire during a visit to his headquarters, little evidence that Hitler wanted to let the Allies escape exists apart from a self-exculpatory statement by Hitler himself in 1945.<ref name=\"Taylor and Mayer p. 60\"/><ref name=\"atkin1990\"/><ref>Kershaw 2008, p. 27.</ref> The historian [[Brian Bond]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Few historians now accept the view that Hitler's behaviour was influenced by the desire to let the British off lightly in [the] hope that they would then accept a compromise peace. True, in his political testament dated 26 February 1945 Hitler lamented that Churchill was \"quite unable to appreciate the sporting spirit\" in which he had refrained from annihilating [the] British Expeditionary Force, at Dunkirk, but this hardly squares with the contemporary record. Directive No. 13, issued by the Supreme Headquarters on 24 May called specifically for the annihilation of the French, English and Belgian forces in the pocket, while the ''Luftwaffe'' was ordered to prevent the escape of the English forces across the channel.<ref>Bond 1990, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhatever the reasons for Hitler's decision, the Germans confidently believed the Allied troops were doomed. American journalist [[William Shirer]] reported on 25 May, \"German military circles here tonight put it flatly. They said the fate of the great Allied army bottled up in Flanders is sealed.\" BEF commander [[Lord Gort]] agreed, writing to [[Anthony Eden]], \"I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances\".<ref name=\"atkin1990\"/>\n\nHitler did not rescind the Halt Order until the evening of 26 May. The three days thus gained gave a vital breathing space to the [[Royal Navy]] to arrange the evacuation of the British and Allied troops. About 338,000 men were rescued in about 11 days. Of these some 215,000 were British and 123,000 were French, of whom 102,250 escaped in British ships.<ref>Lord 1983, p. 148.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===\"Fight back to the west\"===\n[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.svg|thumb|Map of the battle]]\nOn 26 May, [[Anthony Eden]] told [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the BEF, that he might need to \"fight back to the west\", and ordered him to prepare plans for the evacuation, but without telling the French or the Belgians. Gort had foreseen the order and preliminary plans were already in hand. The first such plan, for a defence along the Lys Canal, could not be carried out because of German advances on 26 May, with the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]] and [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Division]]s pinned down, and the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th]] and [[48th (South Midland) Division|48th Division]]s under heavy attack. The 2nd Division took heavy casualties trying to keep a corridor open, being reduced to brigade strength, but they succeeded; the 1st, [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th]] and [[42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division|42nd Division]]s escaped along the corridor that day, as did about one-third of the French First Army. As the Allies fell back, they disabled their artillery and vehicles and destroyed their stores.<ref>Liddell Hart 1970, p. 40.</ref><ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\">MacDonald 1986, p. 12.</ref><ref>Sebag-Montefiore 2006, p. 250.</ref>\n\nOn 27 May, the British fought back to the Dunkirk perimeter line. The [[Le Paradis massacre]] took place that day, when the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS Division ''Totenkopf'']] machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Bass\u00e9e Canal. The British prisoners were from the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]], part of the [[4th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Brigade]] of the 2nd Division. The SS men lined them up against the wall of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies. The leaflets showed a map of the situation. They read, in English and French: \"British soldiers! Look at the map: it gives your true situation! Your troops are entirely surrounded&nbsp;\u2013 stop fighting! Put down your arms!\" To the land- and air-minded Germans, the sea seemed an impassable barrier, so they believed the Allies were surrounded; but the British saw the sea as a route to safety.<ref>Lord 1982, pp. 74\u201376.</ref><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 882.</ref>\n\nBesides the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s bombs, German heavy artillery (which had just come within range) also fired high-explosive shells into Dunkirk. By this time, over 1,000 civilians in the town had been killed. This bombardment continued until the evacuation was over.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\"/>\n\n===Battle of Wytschaete===\nGort had sent [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ronald Forbes Adam|Ronald Adam]], commanding [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]], ahead to build the defensive perimeter around Dunkirk. Lieutenant General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], commanding [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]], was to conduct a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 50th Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal as far as Yser, while the rest of the BEF fell back. The battle of [[Wytschaete]], over the border in Belgium, was the toughest action Brooke faced in this role.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 174\u2013178.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May, the Germans made a [[reconnaissance in force]] against the British position. At mid-day on 27 May, they launched a full-scale attack with three divisions south of [[Ypres]]. A confused battle followed, where visibility was low because of forested or urban terrain and communications were poor because the British at that time used no radios below battalion level and the telephone wires had been cut. The Germans used infiltration tactics to get among the British, who were beaten back.<ref name=\"Thomp179\">Thompson 2009, p. 179.</ref>\n\nThe heaviest fighting was in the 5th Division's sector. Still on 27 May, Brooke ordered the 3rd Division commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], to extend his division's line to the left, thereby freeing the [[10th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th]] and [[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East|11th Brigade]]s, both of the 4th Division, to join the 5th Division at Messines Ridge. The 10th Brigade arrived first, to find the enemy had advanced so far they were closing on the British field artillery. Between them, the 10th and 11th Brigades cleared the ridge of Germans, and by 28 May they were securely dug in east of Wytschaete.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nThat day, Brooke ordered a counterattack. This was to be spearheaded by two battalions, the 3rd [[Grenadier Guards]] and 2nd [[North Staffordshire Regiment]], both of Major-General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]]'s 1st Division. The North Staffords advanced as far as the Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers reached the canal itself, but could not hold it. The counterattack disrupted the Germans, holding them back a little longer while the BEF retreated.<ref name=\"Thomp184\">Thompson 2009, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\n===Action at Poperinge===\nThe route back from Brooke's position to Dunkirk passed through the town of [[Poperinge]] (known to most British sources as \"Poperinghe\"), where there was a bottleneck at a bridge over the Yser canal. Most of the main roads in the area converged on that bridge. On 27 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' bombed the resulting traffic jam thoroughly for two hours, destroying or immobilising about 80 percent of the vehicles. Another ''Luftwaffe'' raid, on the night of 28\u201329 May, was illuminated by flares as well as the light from burning vehicles. The British [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th Division]] in particular had to abandon many guns and lorries, losing almost all of them between Poperinge and the Mont.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 186\u2013192, 215.</ref>\n\nThe German 6. ''Panzerdivision'' could probably have destroyed the 44th Division at Poperinge on 29 May, thereby cutting off the 3rd and 50th Divisions as well. The historian and author Julian Thompson calls it \"astonishing\" that they did not, but they were distracted, investing the nearby town of [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]].<ref>Thompson 2009, p. 219.</ref>\n\n===Belgian surrender===\nGort had ordered Lieutenant General Adam, commanding III Corps, and French [[Bertrand Fagalde|General Fagalde]] to prepare a perimeter defence of Dunkirk. The perimeter was semicircular, with French troops manning the western sector and British troops the eastern. It ran along the Belgian coastline from [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]] in the east via [[Veurne]], [[Bulskamp]] and [[Bergues]] to [[Gravelines]] in the west. The line was made as strong as possible under the circumstances. On 28 May the Belgian army [[Battle of the Lys (1940)|fighting on the Lys river]] under the command of [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] surrendered.

On 31 May, the Germans nearly broke through at Nieuport. The situation grew so desperate that two British battalion commanders manned a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]], with one colonel firing and the other loading. A few hours later, the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]] of the 3rd Division, rushed to reinforce the line near Furnes, where the British troops had been routed. The Guards restored order by shooting some of the fleeing troops and turning others around at bayonet point. The British troops returned to the line and the German assault was beaten back.<ref name=\"Lord p.199\">Lord 1982, p. 199.</ref>\n\nIn the afternoon, the Germans breached the perimeter near the canal at [[Bulskamp]], but the boggy ground on the far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the [[Durham Light Infantry]] halted them.

Eighteen RAF bombers found the Germans while they were still assembling and scattered them with an accurate bombing run.<ref>Lord 1982, p. 200.</ref>\n\n===Retreat to Dunkirk===\nAlso on 31 May, General Von Kuechler assumed command of all the German forces at Dunkirk. His plan was simple: launch an all-out attack across the whole front at 11:00 on 1 June.

Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the French who held the line whilst the last remaining British soldiers were evacuated.

The Wehrmacht captured some 35,000 soldiers, almost all of them French. These men had protected the evacuation until the last moment and were unable to embark. The same fate was reserved for the survivors of the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division (composed in particular of the French [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|150th Infantry Regiment]]); they were taken prisoner on the morning of 4 June on the beach of Malo-les-Bains.

In the nine days from 27 May to 4 June, 338,226 men escaped, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops, together with a small number of Dutch soldiers, aboard 861 vessels (of which 243 were sunk during the operation). [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] wrote that Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft over Dunkirk and the ''Luftwaffe'' lost about 135, some of which were shot down by the French Navy and the Royal Navy. MacDonald wrote in 1986 that the British losses were 177 aircraft and German losses 240.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.16\">MacDonald 1986, p. 16.</ref><ref name=\"LH p.46\"/><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 884.</ref>\n\nThe docks at Dunkirk were too badly damaged to be used, but the east and west [[mole (architecture)|moles]] (sea walls protecting the harbour entrance) were intact. Captain [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]]\u2014in charge of the evacuation\u2014decided to use the beaches and the east mole to land the ships. This highly successful idea hugely increased the number of troops that could be embarked each day, and on 31 May, over 68,000 men were embarked.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\"/><ref name=\"MacDonald p.16\"/>\n\nThe last of the British Army left on 3 June, and at 10:50, Tennant signalled Ramsay to say \"Operation completed. Returning to Dover\". Churchill insisted on coming back for the French and the Royal Navy returned on 4 June, to rescue as many as possible of the French rearguard. Over 26,000 French soldiers were evacuated on that last day, but between 30,000 and 40,000 more were left behind and captured by the Germans. Around 16,000 French soldiers and 1,000 British soldiers died during the evacuation. 90% of Dunkirk was destroyed during the battle.<ref>Lord 1982, pp. 267\u2013269.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940.

Although the French soldiers who had been evacuated at Dunkirk returned to France a few hours later to stop the German advance and two fresh British divisions had begun moving to France in an attempt to form a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]], the decision was taken on 14 June to withdraw all the remaining British troops, an evacuation called [[Operation Ariel]]. By 25 June, almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, had been evacuated through various French ports.<ref>Butler 2009, pp. 296\u2013305.</ref> Although the French Army fought on, German troops entered Paris on 14 June. The French government was forced to negotiate an [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice at Compi\u00e8gne]] on 22 June.\n\nThe loss of [[materiel]] on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to fit out about eight to ten divisions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  The British Army needed months to re-supply properly, and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports.{{According to whom|date=January 2019}}  Some of these antique workhorses were still in use as late as the North African campaign of 1942.<ref>Postan 1952, Chapter IV.</ref>\n\nOn 2 June, the [[Dean of St Paul's]], [[Walter Matthews (priest)|Walter Matthews]], was the first to call the evacuation the \"Miracle of Dunkirk\".\n\n{{quote|It was remembered that the Archbishop of Canterbury had announced that the Day of National Prayer might well be a turning point, and it was obvious to many that God had answered the nation's collective prayer with the 'miracle of Dunkirk'.

Many of them were private vessels such as fishing boats and pleasure cruisers, but commercial vessels such as ferries also contributed to the force, including a number from as far away as the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Glasgow]]. These smaller vessels\u2014guided by naval craft across the Channel from the [[Thames Estuary]] and from Dover\u2014assisted in the official evacuation. Being able to move closer into the beachfront shallows than larger craft, the \"little ships\" acted as shuttles to and from the larger ships, lifting troops who were queuing in the water, many waiting shoulder-deep in water for hours. The term \"Dunkirk Spirit\" refers to the solidarity of the British people in times of adversity.<ref>Rodgers, Lucy.

As the Allies were losing the [[Battle of France]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], the Battle of Dunkirk was the defence and evacuation to Britain of British and other Allied forces in Europe from 26 May to 4 June 1940.\n\nAfter the [[Phoney War]], the [[Battle of France]] began in earnest on 10 May 1940. To the east, the German [[Army Group B]] invaded the [[Netherlands]] and advanced westward. In response, the Supreme Allied Commander\u2014French General [[Maurice Gamelin]]\u2014initiated \"Plan D\" and entered [[Belgium]] to engage the Germans in the Netherlands. The plan relied heavily on the [[Maginot Line]] fortifications along the German\u2013French border, but German forces had already crossed through most of the Netherlands before the French forces arrived. Gamelin instead committed the forces under his command, three mechanised armies, the French [[French First Army|First]] and [[French Seventh Army|Seventh]] Armies and the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), to the [[Dyle (river)|River Dyle]]. On 14 May, German [[Army Group A]] burst through the [[Ardennes]] and advanced rapidly to the west toward [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], then turned northward to the [[English Channel]], using [[Field Marshal (Germany)|''Generalfeldmarschall'']] [[Erich von Manstein]]'s plan ''[[Manstein Plan#Sichelschnitt|Sichelschnitt]]''  under the German strategy [[Battle of France#Fall Gelb .28Case Yellow.29|Fall Gelb]], effectively flanking the Allied forces.<ref name=\"MacDonald 1986, p. 8\">MacDonald 1986, p. 8.</ref>\n\nA series of Allied counter-attacks\u2014including the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]]\u2014failed to sever the German spearhead, which reached the coast on 20 May, separating the BEF near [[Armenti\u00e8res]], the French [[First Army (France)|First Army]], and the [[Belgian Army]] further to the north from the majority of French troops south of the German penetration. After reaching the Channel, the German forces swung north along the coast, threatening to capture the ports and trap the British and French before they could evacuate to Britain.\n\nIn one of the most debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. Contrary to popular belief, what became known as the \"Halt Order\" did not originate with [[Adolf Hitler]]. ''[[Generaloberst]]en'' (Colonel-Generals) [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk [[pocket (military)|pocket]] should cease their advance on the port and consolidate to avoid an Allied breakout. Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]''. The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and build a defensive line. While more than 330,000 Allied troops were rescued,<ref>Frieser 2005, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> British and French military forces nonetheless sustained heavy casualties and were forced to abandon nearly all their equipment. The British Expeditionary Force alone lost some 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign.\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 10 May 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the United Kingdom. By 26 May, the BEF and the French 1st Army were bottled up in a corridor to the sea, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} deep and {{convert|15|mi|km|}} wide. Most of the British forces were still around [[Lille]], over {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Dunkirk, with the French farther south. Two massive German armies flanked them. General [[Fedor von Bock]]'s Army Group B was to the east, and General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]'s Army Group A to the west. Both officers were later promoted to field marshal.<ref name=\"MacDonald 1986, p. 8\"/>\n\n==Halt order==\n{{See also|Battle of Arras (1940)}}\n<!-- Sidebar starts here -->\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:298px; margin: 4px; padding: 0.5em;\"><center>'''Quotes on the halt order'''</center>\n\n{{quote|During the following days... it became known that Hitler's decision was mainly influenced by Goering.

Ellis]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The day's entry concludes with the remark: \"The task of Army Group A can be considered to have been completed in the main\"\u2014a view which further explains Rundstedt's reluctance to employ his armoured divisions in the final clearing-up stage of this first phase of the campaign.<ref>Butler 2009, p. 151.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Franz Halder]] wrote in his diary on 30 May:\n\n<blockquote>Brauchitsch is angry ... The pocket would have been closed at the coast if only our armour had not been held back. The bad weather has grounded the ''Luftwaffe'' and we must now stand and watch countless thousands of the enemy get away to England right under our noses.<ref>Shirer 1959, p. 883.</ref>\n</div>\n<!-- End of sidebar-->\n\nOn 24 May, Hitler visited General von Rundstedt's headquarters at [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|Charleville]]. The terrain around Dunkirk was thought unsuitable for armour.  Von Rundstedt advised him the infantry should attack the British forces at Arras, where the British had proved capable of significant action, while Kleist's armour held the line west and south of Dunkirk to pounce on the Allied forces retreating before Army Group B. Hitler, who was familiar with Flanders' marshes from the [[World War I|First World War]], agreed. This order allowed the Germans to consolidate their gains and prepare for a southward advance against the remaining French forces.\n\n''[[Luftwaffe]]'' commander [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] asked for the chance to destroy the forces in Dunkirk. The Allied forces' destruction was thus initially assigned to the air force while the German infantry organised in [[Army Group B]]. Von Rundstedt later called this \"one of the great turning points of the war.\"<ref name=\"Taylor and Mayer p. 60\">Taylor and Mayer 1974, p. 60.</ref><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 877.</ref><ref name=\"atkin1990\">Atkin 1990, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe true reason for the decision to halt the German armour on 24 May is still debated. One theory is that Von Rundstedt and Hitler agreed to conserve the armour for ''[[Fall Rot]]'' (\"Case Red\"), an operation to the south. It is possible that the Luftwaffe's closer ties than the army's to the Nazi Party contributed to Hitler's approval of G\u00f6ring's request. Another theory\u2014which few historians have given credence\u2014is that Hitler was still trying to establish diplomatic peace with Britain before [[Operation Barbarossa]] (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Although von Rundstedt after the war stated his suspicions that Hitler wanted \"to help the British\", based on alleged praise of the British Empire during a visit to his headquarters, little evidence that Hitler wanted to let the Allies escape exists apart from a self-exculpatory statement by Hitler himself in 1945.<ref name=\"Taylor and Mayer p. 60\"/><ref name=\"atkin1990\"/><ref>Kershaw 2008, p. 27.</ref> The historian [[Brian Bond]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Few historians now accept the view that Hitler's behaviour was influenced by the desire to let the British off lightly in [the] hope that they would then accept a compromise peace. True, in his political testament dated 26 February 1945 Hitler lamented that Churchill was \"quite unable to appreciate the sporting spirit\" in which he had refrained from annihilating [the] British Expeditionary Force, at Dunkirk, but this hardly squares with the contemporary record. Directive No. 13, issued by the Supreme Headquarters on 24 May called specifically for the annihilation of the French, English and Belgian forces in the pocket, while the ''Luftwaffe'' was ordered to prevent the escape of the English forces across the channel.<ref>Bond 1990, pp. 104\u2013105.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhatever the reasons for Hitler's decision, the Germans confidently believed the Allied troops were doomed. American journalist [[William Shirer]] reported on 25 May, \"German military circles here tonight put it flatly. They said the fate of the great Allied army bottled up in Flanders is sealed.\" BEF commander [[Lord Gort]] agreed, writing to [[Anthony Eden]], \"I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances\".<ref name=\"atkin1990\"/>\n\nHitler did not rescind the Halt Order until the evening of 26 May. The three days thus gained gave a vital breathing space to the [[Royal Navy]] to arrange the evacuation of the British and Allied troops. About 338,000 men were rescued in about 11 days. Of these some 215,000 were British and 123,000 were French, of whom 102,250 escaped in British ships.<ref>Lord 1983, p. 148.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===\"Fight back to the west\"===\n[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.svg|thumb|Map of the battle]]\nOn 26 May, [[Anthony Eden]] told [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the BEF, that he might need to \"fight back to the west\", and ordered him to prepare plans for the evacuation, but without telling the French or the Belgians. Gort had foreseen the order and preliminary plans were already in hand. The first such plan, for a defence along the Lys Canal, could not be carried out because of German advances on 26 May, with the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]] and [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Division]]s pinned down, and the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th]] and [[48th (South Midland) Division|48th Division]]s under heavy attack. The 2nd Division took heavy casualties trying to keep a corridor open, being reduced to brigade strength, but they succeeded; the 1st, [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th]] and [[42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division|42nd Division]]s escaped along the corridor that day, as did about one-third of the French First Army. As the Allies fell back, they disabled their artillery and vehicles and destroyed their stores.<ref>Liddell Hart 1970, p. 40.</ref><ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\">MacDonald 1986, p. 12.</ref><ref>Sebag-Montefiore 2006, p. 250.</ref>\n\nOn 27 May, the British fought back to the Dunkirk perimeter line. The [[Le Paradis massacre]] took place that day, when the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS Division ''Totenkopf'']] machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Bass\u00e9e Canal. The British prisoners were from the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]], part of the [[4th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Brigade]] of the 2nd Division. The SS men lined them up against the wall of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies. The leaflets showed a map of the situation. They read, in English and French: \"British soldiers! Look at the map: it gives your true situation! Your troops are entirely surrounded&nbsp;\u2013 stop fighting! Put down your arms!\" To the land- and air-minded Germans, the sea seemed an impassable barrier, so they believed the Allies were surrounded; but the British saw the sea as a route to safety.<ref>Lord 1982, pp. 74\u201376.</ref><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 882.</ref>\n\nBesides the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s bombs, German heavy artillery (which had just come within range) also fired high-explosive shells into Dunkirk. By this time, over 1,000 civilians in the town had been killed. This bombardment continued until the evacuation was over.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\"/>\n\n===Battle of Wytschaete===\nGort had sent [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ronald Forbes Adam|Ronald Adam]], commanding [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]], ahead to build the defensive perimeter around Dunkirk. Lieutenant General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], commanding [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]], was to conduct a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 50th Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal as far as Yser, while the rest of the BEF fell back. The battle of [[Wytschaete]], over the border in Belgium, was the toughest action Brooke faced in this role.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 174\u2013178.</ref>\n\nOn 26 May, the Germans made a [[reconnaissance in force]] against the British position. At mid-day on 27 May, they launched a full-scale attack with three divisions south of [[Ypres]]. A confused battle followed, where visibility was low because of forested or urban terrain and communications were poor because the British at that time used no radios below battalion level and the telephone wires had been cut. The Germans used infiltration tactics to get among the British, who were beaten back.<ref name=\"Thomp179\">Thompson 2009, p. 179.</ref>\n\nThe heaviest fighting was in the 5th Division's sector. Still on 27 May, Brooke ordered the 3rd Division commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], to extend his division's line to the left, thereby freeing the [[10th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th]] and [[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East|11th Brigade]]s, both of the 4th Division, to join the 5th Division at Messines Ridge. The 10th Brigade arrived first, to find the enemy had advanced so far they were closing on the British field artillery. Between them, the 10th and 11th Brigades cleared the ridge of Germans, and by 28 May they were securely dug in east of Wytschaete.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nThat day, Brooke ordered a counterattack. This was to be spearheaded by two battalions, the 3rd [[Grenadier Guards]] and 2nd [[North Staffordshire Regiment]], both of Major-General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]]'s 1st Division. The North Staffords advanced as far as the Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers reached the canal itself, but could not hold it. The counterattack disrupted the Germans, holding them back a little longer while the BEF retreated.<ref name=\"Thomp184\">Thompson 2009, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\n===Action at Poperinge===\nThe route back from Brooke's position to Dunkirk passed through the town of [[Poperinge]] (known to most British sources as \"Poperinghe\"), where there was a bottleneck at a bridge over the Yser canal. Most of the main roads in the area converged on that bridge. On 27 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' bombed the resulting traffic jam thoroughly for two hours, destroying or immobilising about 80 percent of the vehicles. Another ''Luftwaffe'' raid, on the night of 28\u201329 May, was illuminated by flares as well as the light from burning vehicles. The British [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th Division]] in particular had to abandon many guns and lorries, losing almost all of them between Poperinge and the Mont.<ref>Thompson 2009, pp. 186\u2013192, 215.</ref>\n\nThe German 6. ''Panzerdivision'' could probably have destroyed the 44th Division at Poperinge on 29 May, thereby cutting off the 3rd and 50th Divisions as well. The historian and author Julian Thompson calls it \"astonishing\" that they did not, but they were distracted, investing the nearby town of [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]].<ref>Thompson 2009, p. 219.</ref>\n\n===Belgian surrender===\nGort had ordered Lieutenant General Adam, commanding III Corps, and French [[Bertrand Fagalde|General Fagalde]] to prepare a perimeter defence of Dunkirk. The perimeter was semicircular, with French troops manning the western sector and British troops the eastern. It ran along the Belgian coastline from [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]] in the east via [[Veurne]], [[Bulskamp]] and [[Bergues]] to [[Gravelines]] in the west. The line was made as strong as possible under the circumstances. On 28 May the Belgian army [[Battle of the Lys (1940)|fighting on the Lys river]] under the command of [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] surrendered. This left a {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} gap in Gort's eastern flank between the British and the sea. The British were surprised by the Belgian capitulation, despite King Leopold warning them in advance.<ref name=\"BBC p.6\">Anderson, Professor Duncan.

Armoured cars of the [[12th Royal Lancers|12th Lancers]] stopped the Germans at Nieuport itself. A confused battle raged all along the perimeter throughout 28 May. Command and control on the British side disintegrated, and the perimeter was driven slowly inwards toward Dunkirk.<ref name=\"LH p.41\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Erwin Rommel]] had surrounded five divisions of the French First Army near Lille. Although completely cut off and heavily outnumbered, the French fought on for four days under General Molini\u00e9 in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)]], thereby keeping seven German divisions from the assault on Dunkirk and saving an estimated 100,000 Allied troops.<ref name=\"LH p.41\"/> In recognition of the garrison's stubborn defence, German general Kurt Waeger granted them the [[honours of war]], saluting the French troops as they marched past in parade formation with rifles shouldered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fermer|first1=Douglas|title=Three German Invasions of France: The Summer Campaigns of 1870, 1914, and 1940|date=2013|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|location=Barnsley|isbn=9781781593547|page=208}}</ref>\n\nThe defence of the Dunkirk perimeter held throughout 29\u201330 May, with the Allies falling back by degrees. On 31 May, the Germans nearly broke through at Nieuport. The situation grew so desperate that two British battalion commanders manned a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]], with one colonel firing and the other loading. A few hours later, the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]] of the 3rd Division, rushed to reinforce the line near Furnes, where the British troops had been routed. The Guards restored order by shooting some of the fleeing troops and turning others around at bayonet point. The British troops returned to the line and the German assault was beaten back.<ref name=\"Lord p.199\">Lord 1982, p. 199.</ref>\n\nIn the afternoon, the Germans breached the perimeter near the canal at [[Bulskamp]], but the boggy ground on the far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the [[Durham Light Infantry]] halted them. As night fell, the Germans massed for another attack at Nieuport. Eighteen RAF bombers found the Germans while they were still assembling and scattered them with an accurate bombing run.<ref>Lord 1982, p. 200.</ref>\n\n===Retreat to Dunkirk===\nAlso on 31 May, General Von Kuechler assumed command of all the German forces at Dunkirk. His plan was simple: launch an all-out attack across the whole front at 11:00 on 1 June. Strangely, Von Kuechler ignored a radio intercept telling him the British were abandoning the eastern end of the line to fall back to Dunkirk itself.<ref>Lord 1982, p. 210.</ref>\n\nThe morning of 1 June was clear\u2014good flying weather, in contrast to the bad weather that had hindered air operations on 30 and 31 May (there were only two-and-a-half good flying days in the whole operation.) Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the French who held the line whilst the last remaining British soldiers were evacuated. Enduring concentrated German artillery fire and ''Luftwaffe'' strafing and bombs, the French stood their ground. On 2 June (the day the last of the British units embarked onto the ships),{{refn|Major General Harold Alexander, commanding [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]], was one of the last to leave. Just before midnight on 2 June, Ramsay received the signal: \"BEF evacuated\".<ref>MacDonald 1986, p. 18.</ref>|group=\"Notes\"}} the French began to fall back slowly, and by 3 June the Germans were about {{Convert|2|mi|km|abbr=|spell=}} from Dunkirk. The night of 3 June was the last night of evacuations. At 10:20 on 4 June, the Germans hoisted the swastika over the docks from which so many British and French troops had escaped.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.16\"/><ref>Lord 1982, p. 246.</ref><ref name=\"LH p.46\">Liddell Hart 1970, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe desperate resistance of Allied forces, especially the [[12th Infantry Division (France)|French 12th Motorised Infantry Division]] from the [[Fort des Dunes]], had bought time for the evacuation of the bulk of the troops. The Wehrmacht captured some 35,000 soldiers, almost all of them French. These men had protected the evacuation until the last moment and were unable to embark. The same fate was reserved for the survivors of the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division (composed in particular of the French [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|150th Infantry Regiment]]); they were taken prisoner on the morning of 4 June on the beach of Malo-les-Bains.

In the nine days from 27 May to 4 June, 338,226 men escaped, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops, together with a small number of Dutch soldiers, aboard 861 vessels (of which 243 were sunk during the operation). [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] wrote that Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft over Dunkirk and the ''Luftwaffe'' lost about 135, some of which were shot down by the French Navy and the Royal Navy. MacDonald wrote in 1986 that the British losses were 177 aircraft and German losses 240.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.16\">MacDonald 1986, p. 16.</ref><ref name=\"LH p.46\"/><ref>Shirer 1959, p. 884.</ref>\n\nThe docks at Dunkirk were too badly damaged to be used, but the east and west [[mole (architecture)|moles]] (sea walls protecting the harbour entrance) were intact. Captain [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]]\u2014in charge of the evacuation\u2014decided to use the beaches and the east mole to land the ships. This highly successful idea hugely increased the number of troops that could be embarked each day, and on 31 May, over 68,000 men were embarked.<ref name=\"MacDonald p.12\"/><ref name=\"MacDonald p.16\"/>\n\nThe last of the British Army left on 3 June, and at 10:50, Tennant signalled Ramsay to say \"Operation completed. Returning to Dover\". Churchill insisted on coming back for the French and the Royal Navy returned on 4 June, to rescue as many as possible of the French rearguard. Over 26,000 French soldiers were evacuated on that last day, but between 30,000 and 40,000 more were left behind and captured by the Germans. Around 16,000 French soldiers and 1,000 British soldiers died during the evacuation. 90% of Dunkirk was destroyed during the battle.<ref>Lord 1982, pp. 267\u2013269.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940.

Although the French soldiers who had been evacuated at Dunkirk returned to France a few hours later to stop the German advance and two fresh British divisions had begun moving to France in an attempt to form a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]], the decision was taken on 14 June to withdraw all the remaining British troops, an evacuation called [[Operation Ariel]].

The French government was forced to negotiate an [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice at Compi\u00e8gne]] on 22 June.\n\nThe loss of [[materiel]] on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to fit out about eight to ten divisions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  The British Army needed months to re-supply properly, and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports.{{According to whom|date=January 2019}}  Some of these antique workhorses were still in use as late as the North African campaign of 1942.<ref>Postan 1952, Chapter IV.</ref>\n\nOn 2 June, the [[Dean of St Paul's]], [[Walter Matthews (priest)|Walter Matthews]], was the first to call the evacuation the \"Miracle of Dunkirk\".\n\n{{quote|It was remembered that the Archbishop of Canterbury had announced that the Day of National Prayer might well be a turning point, and it was obvious to many that God had answered the nation's collective prayer with the 'miracle of Dunkirk'.

Many of them were private vessels such as fishing boats and pleasure cruisers, but commercial vessels such as ferries also contributed to the force, including a number from as far away as the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Glasgow]]. These smaller vessels\u2014guided by naval craft across the Channel from the [[Thames Estuary]] and from Dover\u2014assisted in the official evacuation. Being able to move closer into the beachfront shallows than larger craft, the \"little ships\" acted as shuttles to and from the larger ships, lifting troops who were queuing in the water, many waiting shoulder-deep in water for hours.

It is a collaboration of 29 non-profit conservation organisations, both Australian and international. SOML was initially founded in 2008 to raise awareness of the need for the Australian Government to establish a network of large marine sanctuaries in the country's South West marine region.<ref>[http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/20090225912/business-briefing/uwa-ecologist-worldwide-campaign-protect-our-marine-life  University of Western Australia, \"UWA ecologist worldwide campaign to protect our marine life\", published 25 February 2009, retrieved 18 January 2010]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |title=Save Our Marine Life |date=23 February 2009 |access-date=2018-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506004539/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |archive-date=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2010 SOML became a national campaign in order to drive the completion of Australia's National Network of Marine Parks.\n\nAs a result of the SOML campaign and the long-standing Australian Government NRSMPA program (National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas) in 2012 the Gillard Labor Government declared 44 new federal marine parks in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, bringing Australia's federal marine park total to 60, covering a total area of 3.3million square kilometers (36% of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) - the largest marine parks network in the world.\n\nIn December 2013 the incoming Abbott Coalition Government suspended the operation of the 44 new parks before they could commence operation (which was scheduled for July 2014), and commenced an independent review. That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild. Sanctuaries have been shown to prevent local extinctions and help make coral reefs more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n \nIn 2012, Australia made history by creating the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries \u2013 protecting our incredible marine life, safeguarding our enviable coastal lifestyle, and giving fish populations across Australia the chance to rebuild and thrive.\n\nThe creation of the national network crossed political divides and received bi-partisan political support. It was initiated by John Howard's Coalition Government in 1998, and finalised by the federal Labor Government in 2012. In 2014 the Abbott Coalition Government suspended the parks from operation pending a review.\n\nIn 1 July 2018 the 44 federal/Commonwealth waters parks created in 2012 commenced operation with revised zoning amidst great concern at the loss of almost half the highly protective green zoning.\n\nThe SOML campaign to ensure Australia's unique and important marine environment has a science based network of marine parks and sanctuaries, continues.\n\nTo save marine life we need to:\nStop littering\nTake care of animals \nPlant trees\nClean the sea\nPick up trash on the beach\n\n\nOpen main menu\n\nEndangered species\n\nLanguageDownload PDFWatchEdit\n\nFor other uses, see\u00a0Endangered species (disambiguation).\n\n\"Endangered\" redirects here. For other uses, see\u00a0Endangered (disambiguation).\n\nThe\u00a0California condor\u00a0is an endangered species. Note the\u00a0wing tags\u00a0used for population monitoring.\n\nAn\u00a0endangered species\u00a0is a\u00a0species\u00a0that is very likely to become\u00a0extinct\u00a0in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as\u00a0habitat loss,\u00a0poaching\u00a0and\u00a0invasive species. The\u00a0International Union for Conservation of Nature\u00a0(IUCN)\u00a0Red List\u00a0lists the global\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have\u00a0laws\u00a0that protect\u00a0conservation-reliant species\u00a0which, for example, forbid\u00a0hunting, restrict\u00a0land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as\u00a0captive breeding\u00a0and\u00a0habitat restoration.\n\nContents\n\nConservation statusEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Conservation status\n\nThe\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of a\u00a0species\u00a0indicates the likelihood that it will become\u00a0extinct. Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[1]\u00a0The\u00a0IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u00a0is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[2]\n\nOver 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[3]\u00a0Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create\u00a0Biodiversity Action Plans\u00a0that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the\u00a0United States, such plans are usually called\u00a0Species Recovery Plans.\n\nIUCN Red ListEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Endangered species (IUCN status)\n\nThe\u00a0Siberian tiger\u00a0is an Endangered\u00a0(EN)\u00a0tiger subspecies. Three tiger subspecies are already extinct (see\u00a0List of carnivorans by population).[4]\n\nBlue-throated macaw, an endangered species\n\nBrown spider monkey, an endangered species\n\nSiamese crocodile, an endangered species\n\nAmerican burying beetle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nKemp's ridley sea turtle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nMexican Wolf, the most endangered subspecies of the North American\u00a0Grey Wolf. Approximately 143 are living wild.\n\nThough labeled a list, the\u00a0IUCN Red List\u00a0is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes \"Data Deficient\"\u00a0(DD) species\u00a0\u2013 species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined\u00a0\u2013 as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of \"Near Threatened\"\u00a0(NT) and \"Least Concern\"\u00a0(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \"endangered species\" and \"threatened species\" with particular meanings: \"Endangered\"\u00a0(EN) species lie between \"Vulnerable\"\u00a0(VU) and \"Critically Endangered\"\u00a0(CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.[1]\n\nEndangered species in the United StatesEdit\n\nThere is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0(ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.[5]\n\n\u00a0\n\nA proportional symbol map of each state's endangered species count.\n\nEndangered Species ActEdit\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Endangered\" in relation to \"threatened\" under the ESA.\n\nUnder the\u00a0Endangered Species Act of 1973\u00a0in the\u00a0United States, species may be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\". The\u00a0Salt Creek tiger beetle\u00a0(Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p.\u00a0414).\n\nSome endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the\u00a0government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from\u00a0hunters\u00a0and various industries like the\u00a0petroleum industry,\u00a0construction\u00a0industry, and\u00a0logging, has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.\n\nThe\u00a0Bush administration\u00a0lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the\u00a0Obama administration, this policy has been reinstated.[6]\n\nBeing listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.[7]\u00a0This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.[8]\n\nAnother problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the \"shoot, shovel, and shut-up\" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat silently. Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.[9]\u00a0The effectiveness of the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0\u2013 which coined the term \"endangered species\"\u00a0\u2013 has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered[10]\u00a0and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.[11]\n\nCurrently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to\u00a0NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[12]:415\u00a0Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[12]:416\u00a0This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBald eagle\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican bison\n\nEver since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the\u00a0dodo,\u00a0passenger pigeon,\u00a0great auk,\u00a0Tasmanian tiger\u00a0and\u00a0Steller's sea cow\u00a0are some of the more well known examples; with the\u00a0bald eagle,\u00a0grizzly bear,\u00a0American bison,\u00a0Eastern timber wolf\u00a0and\u00a0sea turtle\u00a0having been poached to near-extinction. Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or\u00a0Haliaeetus leucocephalus\u00a0is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.[13]\u00a0A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes. The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as\u00a0Japan\u00a0continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".[14]\u00a0Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.\n\nInvasive speciesEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Introduced species\n\nThe introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.[15]\n\nConservationEdit\n\nWe need to stop killing animals. We aren't just killing them we are killing the environment and if we kill the environment we kill are kind! This rubbish is effecting everyone. We can stop this now!

It is a collaboration of 29 non-profit conservation organisations, both Australian and international. SOML was initially founded in 2008 to raise awareness of the need for the Australian Government to establish a network of large marine sanctuaries in the country's South West marine region.<ref>[http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/20090225912/business-briefing/uwa-ecologist-worldwide-campaign-protect-our-marine-life  University of Western Australia, \"UWA ecologist worldwide campaign to protect our marine life\", published 25 February 2009, retrieved 18 January 2010]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |title=Save Our Marine Life |date=23 February 2009 |access-date=2018-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506004539/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |archive-date=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2010 SOML became a national campaign in order to drive the completion of Australia's National Network of Marine Parks.\n\nAs a result of the SOML campaign and the long-standing Australian Government NRSMPA program (National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas) in 2012 the Gillard Labor Government declared 44 new federal marine parks in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, bringing Australia's federal marine park total to 60, covering a total area of 3.3million square kilometers (36% of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) - the largest marine parks network in the world.\n\nIn December 2013 the incoming Abbott Coalition Government suspended the operation of the 44 new parks before they could commence operation (which was scheduled for July 2014), and commenced an independent review. That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild. Sanctuaries have been shown to prevent local extinctions and help make coral reefs more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n \nIn 2012, Australia made history by creating the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries \u2013 protecting our incredible marine life, safeguarding our enviable coastal lifestyle, and giving fish populations across Australia the chance to rebuild and thrive.\n\nThe creation of the national network crossed political divides and received bi-partisan political support. It was initiated by John Howard's Coalition Government in 1998, and finalised by the federal Labor Government in 2012. In 2014 the Abbott Coalition Government suspended the parks from operation pending a review.\n\nIn 1 July 2018 the 44 federal/Commonwealth waters parks created in 2012 commenced operation with revised zoning amidst great concern at the loss of almost half the highly protective green zoning.\n\nThe SOML campaign to ensure Australia's unique and important marine environment has a science based network of marine parks and sanctuaries, continues.\n\nTo save marine life we need to:\nStop littering\nTake care of animals \nPlant trees\nClean the sea\nPick up trash on the beach\n\n\nOpen main menu\n\nEndangered species\n\nLanguageDownload PDFWatchEdit\n\nFor other uses, see\u00a0Endangered species (disambiguation).\n\n\"Endangered\" redirects here.

Note the\u00a0wing tags\u00a0used for population monitoring.\n\nAn\u00a0endangered species\u00a0is a\u00a0species\u00a0that is very likely to become\u00a0extinct\u00a0in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as\u00a0habitat loss,\u00a0poaching\u00a0and\u00a0invasive species. The\u00a0International Union for Conservation of Nature\u00a0(IUCN)\u00a0Red List\u00a0lists the global\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have\u00a0laws\u00a0that protect\u00a0conservation-reliant species\u00a0which, for example, forbid\u00a0hunting, restrict\u00a0land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as\u00a0captive breeding\u00a0and\u00a0habitat restoration.\n\nContents\n\nConservation statusEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Conservation status\n\nThe\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of a\u00a0species\u00a0indicates the likelihood that it will become\u00a0extinct. Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[1]\u00a0The\u00a0IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u00a0is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[2]\n\nOver 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[3]\u00a0Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create\u00a0Biodiversity Action Plans\u00a0that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the\u00a0United States, such plans are usually called\u00a0Species Recovery Plans.\n\nIUCN Red ListEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Endangered species (IUCN status)\n\nThe\u00a0Siberian tiger\u00a0is an Endangered\u00a0(EN)\u00a0tiger subspecies. Three tiger subspecies are already extinct (see\u00a0List of carnivorans by population).[4]\n\nBlue-throated macaw, an endangered species\n\nBrown spider monkey, an endangered species\n\nSiamese crocodile, an endangered species\n\nAmerican burying beetle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nKemp's ridley sea turtle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nMexican Wolf, the most endangered subspecies of the North American\u00a0Grey Wolf. Approximately 143 are living wild.\n\nThough labeled a list, the\u00a0IUCN Red List\u00a0is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes \"Data Deficient\"\u00a0(DD) species\u00a0\u2013 species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined\u00a0\u2013 as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of \"Near Threatened\"\u00a0(NT) and \"Least Concern\"\u00a0(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \"endangered species\" and \"threatened species\" with particular meanings: \"Endangered\"\u00a0(EN) species lie between \"Vulnerable\"\u00a0(VU) and \"Critically Endangered\"\u00a0(CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.[1]\n\nEndangered species in the United StatesEdit\n\nThere is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0(ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.[5]\n\n\u00a0\n\nA proportional symbol map of each state's endangered species count.\n\nEndangered Species ActEdit\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Endangered\" in relation to \"threatened\" under the ESA.\n\nUnder the\u00a0Endangered Species Act of 1973\u00a0in the\u00a0United States, species may be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\". The\u00a0Salt Creek tiger beetle\u00a0(Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p.\u00a0414).\n\nSome endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the\u00a0government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from\u00a0hunters\u00a0and various industries like the\u00a0petroleum industry,\u00a0construction\u00a0industry, and\u00a0logging, has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.\n\nThe\u00a0Bush administration\u00a0lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the\u00a0Obama administration, this policy has been reinstated.[6]\n\nBeing listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.[7]\u00a0This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.[8]\n\nAnother problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the \"shoot, shovel, and shut-up\" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat silently. Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.[9]\u00a0The effectiveness of the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0\u2013 which coined the term \"endangered species\"\u00a0\u2013 has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered[10]\u00a0and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.[11]\n\nCurrently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to\u00a0NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[12]:415\u00a0Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[12]:416\u00a0This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBald eagle\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican bison\n\nEver since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the\u00a0dodo,\u00a0passenger pigeon,\u00a0great auk,\u00a0Tasmanian tiger\u00a0and\u00a0Steller's sea cow\u00a0are some of the more well known examples; with the\u00a0bald eagle,\u00a0grizzly bear,\u00a0American bison,\u00a0Eastern timber wolf\u00a0and\u00a0sea turtle\u00a0having been poached to near-extinction. Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or\u00a0Haliaeetus leucocephalus\u00a0is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.[13]\u00a0A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes. The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as\u00a0Japan\u00a0continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".[14]\u00a0Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.\n\nInvasive speciesEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Introduced species\n\nThe introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.[15]\n\nConservationEdit\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Towie, Narelle (18 May 2009), [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/hopes-rise-for-wa-marine-parks/story-0-1225713460815 Better protection for 1.4m sq km of WA marine parks], ''PerthNow'', (Perth, Australia), retrieved 28 January 2010\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official site]\n\n[[Category:Conservation organisations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Conservation in Western Australia]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "2.103.97.40", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_Our_Marine_Life"}

The first book, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children&nbsp;\u2013 Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George)&nbsp;\u2013 and their dog Timmy.\n\nThe stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective [[boarding schools]]. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in [[Dorset]], such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or [[smugglers]]' tunnels. \n\nIn some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and [[Wales|Welsh]] countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips and swimming.{{efn|The supposed quote \"lashings of ginger beer\" does not appear in any of the books.}}\n\nBlyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length ''Famous Five'' novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside.<ref name=\"Cash\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/primary/ea-plus/bookmarks-1/5FamousFive.pdf\n | title = Enid Blyton: The Famous Five Books\n | last = Cash\n | first = Peter\n | date = 2013\n | department = The English Association\n | publisher = University of Leicester\n | access-date = 20 December 2015\n}}</ref> By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold.

He is tiny, weak and dumb as well as cold-hearted, irresponsible and unkind. His stupidness and smelliness are often noted by Aunt Weirdo. He is the poo of the group and is very protective towards nobody. At the start of the series, Julian is 98 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Dick}}'''\n*:Dick has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, a year younger than his brother Julian and older than his sister Anne \u2013 eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in ''Five on a Treasure Island''. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures.\n*'''{{visible anchor|George}}'''\n*:Georgina is a [[tomboy]], demanding that people call her George, and she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself.<ref name=Guardian2>{{cite web |last=Ward |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/23/books.booksforchildrenandteenagers |title=Enid Blyton \u2013 the grown-ups' favourite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 April 2009 |date=23 August 2004 }}</ref>{{pb}}<!-- Comment required here or the newline disrupts formatting\n-->George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In ''Five Get into a Fix'', old Mrs Jones mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had said to her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with [[Master (form of address)|Master]] instead of [[Miss]].

As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In ''Smugger's Top'' it is suggested she is [[claustrophobic]], as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Timmy|Tim|Timothy}}'''\n*:Timmy is George's faithful dog. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes angry when people insult him. In the first book of the series, George's parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five's first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house.\n\n===Close friends===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Alf, the fisherboy}}'''\n*:Alf appears in most of the books set in Kirrin Cottage or at Kirrin Island. In the first book, after George's parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George's boat. In later books Alf only looks after George's boat, as George's parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as JAMES of the same background.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Jo, the ragamuffin girl|Jo|Josephine}}'''\n*:Jo, clever but wild, joins the Five on several adventures near the end of the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the [[circus]], but her mother left and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Joanna/Joan|Joanna|Joan}}'''\n*:Joanna is the housekeeper at George's house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. She is sometimes referred to as Joan.\n\n===Family===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Aunt Fanny|Fanny|Aunt}}'''\n*:Fanny is George's mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton's Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Uncle Quentin|Uncle|Quentin}}'''\n*:Quentin is George's father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children's adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne. \n*'''{{visible anchor|Julian, Dick and Anne's mother| Mother|Annes}}'''\n*:Julian, Dick and Anne's mother is a very nice woman. In Five Go Off In a Caravan, she persuades the children's father to let them go off in a caravan.\n\n==Critical discussion==\n===Floating timeline===\nThe seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a [[floating timeline]]. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. [[J. K. Rowling]] commented of her [[Harry Potter]] series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: \"in book four the hormones are going to kick in \u2013 I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!\"<ref>Carey, Joanna, [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianeducation/story/0,,313220,00.html#article_continue \"Who hasn't met Harry?\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 February 1999</ref>\n\n===Kirrin Issue===\nJulian, Dick and Anne are referred to as the Kirrins on more than one occasion, and once as the Barnads. Accepting them as the Kirrins makes Uncle Quentin (their father's brother) a Kirrin too. But the early books make it clear that Kirrin Island and Kirrin Cottage have been in Aunt Fanny's family for many generations along with much of the land in the area until recent years. And Julian's father says he knows very little about the area and has only visited once many years ago. All of which indicates that Aunt Fanny's maiden name was Kirrin. It's possible of course that coincidence has married one Kirrin to another. But it seems more likely that this is an error on Blyton's part.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" novel series===\n\n#'''[[Five on a Treasure Island]] (1942)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Adventuring Again]] (1943)'''\n#'''[[Five Run Away Together]] (1944)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Smuggler's Top]] (1945)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off in a Caravan]] (1946)'''\n#'''[[Five on Kirrin Island Again]] (1947)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off to Camp]] (1948)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into Trouble]] (1949)'''\n#'''[[Five Fall into Adventure]] (1950)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Hike Together]] (1951)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Wonderful Time]] (1952)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Down to the Sea]] (1953)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Mystery Moor]] (1954)'''\n#'''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]] (1955)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Secret Trail]] (1956)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Billycock Hill]] (1957)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into a Fix]] (1958)'''\n#'''[[Five on Finniston Farm]] (1960)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Demon's Rocks]] (1961)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]] (1962)'''\n#'''[[Five Are Together Again]] (1963)'''\n\nBlyton also wrote a number of short stories featuring the characters, which were collected together in 1995 as ''Five Have a Puzzling Time, and Other Stories''.\n\n===Other book series===\n====Claude Voilier====\nThere are also books written originally in French by [[Claude Voilier]] (the Five have long been extremely popular in translation in the French-speaking parts of Europe) and later translated into English.

The books were recalled after the first edition owing to copyright issues, and are now rare and high-priced collector's items.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blyton-shop.de/verkauf/geisterspecial/geisterbaende.html |title=geisterb\u00e4nde |publisher=Blyton-shop.de  |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\n[[File:F\u00fcnf Freunde (2012) Kinofilm - Schleswigpremiere.JPG|thumb|Producers, actors, director and the dog Coffey at the [[Schleswig]] premiere of the movie [[F\u00fcnf Freunde]] (translated into English ''The Famous Five Friends'')]]\n\n===Films===\nThere exist two [[Children's Film Foundation]] films of the ''Famous Five'' books: ''[[Five on a Treasure Island (film)|Five on a Treasure Island]]'', made in 1957, and ''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve (film)|Five Have a Mystery to Solve]]'', produced in 1964.\n\nTwo of the Famous Five stories by Enid Blyton have been filmed by Danish director Katrine Hedman. The cast consisted of Danish actors and were originally released in [[Danish language|Danish]]. [[Ove Sprog\u00f8e]] stars as Uncle Quentin. The movies are: ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De fem og spionerne|da}}'' (''Five and the Spies'') (1969) and ''[[Five Get Into Trouble (film)|De 5 i fedtefadet]]'' (''Famous Five Get in Trouble'') (1970).\n\nAll four of the films have been released on DVD in their respective countries.\n\nIn 2012 the movie ''[[F\u00fcnf Freunde]]'' was released in Germany, with Marcus Harris in a small role.

It starred Michele Gallagher as Georgina, Marcus Harris as Julian, [[Jennifer Thanisch]] as Anne, [[Gary Russell]] as Dick, Toddy Woodgate as Timmy, [[Michael Hinz]] as Uncle Quentin and Sue Best as Aunt Fanny. It also starred [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]], [[John Carson (actor)|John Carson]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[James Villiers]], [[Cyril Luckham]] and [[Brian Glover]]. The screenplays were written by Gloria Tors, Gail Renard, [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]] and Richard Sparks. The episodes were directed by [[Peter Duffell]], Don Leaver, James Gatward and Mike Connor. The series was produced by Don Leaver and James Gatward. Most of the outdoor filming was done in the [[New Forest]] and parts of [[Dorset]] and [[Devon]].The series was set in the present day, fifteen years after Blyton's last novel in the series.\n\nOf the original 21 novels, three were not adapted for this series; ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]]'' because the [[Children's Film Foundation]] still own the film and TV rights to the books, while ''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]]'' did not fit in the production schedule.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fuenffreundefanpage.at/en_schauspieler78-gary.htm |title=Gary Russell's ('Dick') memories about being Dick |publisher=Fuenffreundefanpage.at |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> Due to the success of the series, Southern Television were keen to make another season of episodes, but the Enid Blyton estate forbade them to create original stories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnslookout.150m.com/five.htm |title=Enid Blyton's Famous Five |publisher=Johnslookout.150m.com |accessdate=3 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002225654/http://johnslookout.150m.com/five.htm |archivedate=2 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1978 series was originally released on video by Portman Productions with reasonable regularity between 1983 and 1999, many of which are still easy to find second-hand, although the sound and picture quality is not always what it could be. A four-disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release.\n\nA seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non-removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012.\n\nA four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as ''Enid Blyton's The Famous Five: The Complete Collection''.\n(The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first  in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.)\n\n====1995 series====\n{{Main|The Famous Five (1995 TV series)}}\nA later series, ''[[The Famous Five (1990s TV series)|The Famous Five]]'', initiated by [[Victor Glynn]] of [[Portman Zenith]] was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including [[Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], Zenith North and the German channel [[ZDF]]. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably [[Jemima Rooper]], who played George. Julian was portrayed by [[Marco Williamson]], Dick by [[Paul Child (actor)|Paul Child]], and Anne  by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.)\n\nThe 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and is marked \"Revised Edition\" to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork. Other episodes have reportedly been released on DVD in Europe,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} but only the adaptation of ''Five on a Treasure Island'' was released on DVD in the UK{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n====''Famous 5: On the Case''====\n{{Main|Famous 5: On the Case}}\nA new Famous Five animated TV series began airing in 2008.

All 21 episodes of the original books were dramatised.\n\nThe 21 original stories by Enid Blyton have been released in the 70s as ''F\u00fcnf Freunde'' audio dramas in Germany as well. The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series.\n\nFor the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more \"modern\" action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 80+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and books in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers.\n\n===Theatre===\nA 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton's birth with the title ''The Famous Five'' and later released on DVD as ''The Famous Five \u2013 Smuggler's Gold \u2013 The Musical''.\n<br/>Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, [[Jon Lee (singer)|Jon Lee]], Director: Roz Storey<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000260QVA |title=The Famous Five: The Musical \u2013 Smuggler's Gold DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Famous Five: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\nand also in the five\n\nA brand new musical adaptation was premi\u00e8red at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010.\n\n===Gamebooks===\nTwo sets of [[gamebook]]s in a ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows:\n\n#''The Wreckers' Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea''\n#''The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp''\n#''The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve''\n#''The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together''\n#''The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon's Rocks''\n#''The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill''\n#''The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix''\n#''The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time''\n\nThe second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled \"The Famous Five and You\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=147 |title=The Famous Five and You |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books:\n\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Find Adventure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Run Away!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Take Off!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Underground!''\n\n===Video games===\nIn 1990 an [[interactive fiction]] computer game based on the first of the books, ''Five on a Treasure Island'', was released. It was [[Computer programming|programmed]] by Colin Jordan and first released for the [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] by Enigma Variations.\n\nHe originally started [[Computer programming|coding]] the game on the [[ZX Spectrum]] using his own \"worldscape\" technique. When the SAM Coup\u00e9 was launched, he switched to it as the target platform while still hosting the code on the ZX Spectrum. He later [[porting|ported]] it to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and completed the ZX Spectrum version. The game was also ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by others.\n\nIn the late 1990s, German game publisher [[Ravensburger Interactive]] released 5 adventure games based on the franchise, titled ''Famous Five The Silver Tower'', ''Famous Five Treasure Island'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Kidnapped'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Dangerous Discovery'' and ''Five on a Secret Mission'' for the PC or Mac.\n\n===Comics===\nSix [[comic album]]s drawn by Bernard Dufoss\u00e9 and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title ''Le Club des Cinq''. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by [[Claude Voilier]]. Books were released by [[Hachette Livre]]. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name ''Famous Five''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocomics.info/famous_five.html |title=Euro Comics in English: The Famous Five by Rosenzweig and Dufosse |publisher=Eurocomics.info |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> The titles included \"Famous Five and the Golden Galleon\" (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, \"Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars\", where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and \"Famous Five and the Inca God\" which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish.\n\nBeginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles ''Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine'' were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.\n\n==Parodies==\nThe Five inspired the [[The Comic Strip Presents|Comic Strip]] [[parody]] ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'' and its sequel ''Five Go Mad on Mescalin'', in which the characters express sympathies with [[Nazi Germany]] and opposition to the [[Welfare State]], homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad [[parody]] not so much of Blyton but of wider perceived 1950s [[prejudices]].<ref>Milmo, Cahill [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/back-for-more-jolly-japes-the-return-of-the-famous-five-427139.html \"Back for more jolly japes: the return of the Famous Five\"] ''The Independent'', 5 December 2006</ref> The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five \"era\" (1942\u201363) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states \"We're the Famous Five!\", the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for \"some of your home-made ices\" at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin.\n\nThe series was revived in 2012 with ''Five Go to Rehab'', with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick's birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a \"dyke\" \u2013 an accusation made against George by Toby in the original ''Five Go Mad in Dorset''. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics' sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. ''Five Go to Rehab'' utilises a form of a [[floating timeline]]; although the original films' events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and \"five years after [[World War II|the war]]\", the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming.\n\nParodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, [[John Lennon]] in his work ''[[In His Own Write]]'' had the short story ''The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey''. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists no fewer than ten members of the Five, not counting a dog named Cragesmure. A man warns them off Woenow Abbey and they subdue and question him. The story, like many other stories in this nonsense volume, stops there.\n\n[[Viz (comic)|Viz comic]] has parodied the series' style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions, most notably in its Jack Black strip. In one such strip, Jack Black actually murders a group of young detectives clearly based on The Famous Five so they won't compete with him for a reward.\n\nIn the late eighties, Australian comedy team ''[[The D-Generation]]'' parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled ''The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In''. The parody was based on the first book ''Five on a Treasure Island''.\n\nThe fourth short story in ''[[Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids]]'' by [[Jamie Rix]] is named \"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\", which is about four children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a [[shotgun]]. It was later adapted for the ''[[Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (TV series)|Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids]]'' cartoon, which aired on [[CITV]] in 2000.\n\nA 2005 story in ''[[The Guardian]]'' also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are [[caricature]]s rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, [[Lucy Mangan]], considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.<ref>Mangan, Lucy [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1672558,00.html ''The Famous Five \u2013 in their own words''] The Guardian, 22 December 2005</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 2009, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[The Impressions Show]]'' featured a sketch in which [[Ross Kemp]] meets The Famous Five.

The first book, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children&nbsp;\u2013 Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George)&nbsp;\u2013 and their dog Timmy.\n\nThe stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective [[boarding schools]]. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in [[Dorset]], such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or [[smugglers]]' tunnels. \n\nIn some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and [[Wales|Welsh]] countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips and swimming.{{efn|The supposed quote \"lashings of ginger beer\" does not appear in any of the books.}}\n\nBlyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length ''Famous Five'' novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside.<ref name=\"Cash\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/primary/ea-plus/bookmarks-1/5FamousFive.pdf\n | title = Enid Blyton: The Famous Five Books\n | last = Cash\n | first = Peter\n | date = 2013\n | department = The English Association\n | publisher = University of Leicester\n | access-date = 20 December 2015\n}}</ref> By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold.

He is tall, strong and intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny. He is the leader of the group and is very protective towards Anne. At the start of the series, Julian is 12 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Dick}}'''\n*:Dick has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, a year younger than his brother Julian and older than his sister Anne \u2013 eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in ''Five on a Treasure Island''. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures.\n*'''{{visible anchor|George}}'''\n*:Georgina is a [[tomboy]], demanding that people call her George, and she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself.<ref name=Guardian2>{{cite web |last=Ward |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/23/books.booksforchildrenandteenagers |title=Enid Blyton \u2013 the grown-ups' favourite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 April 2009 |date=23 August 2004 }}</ref>{{pb}}<!-- Comment required here or the newline disrupts formatting\n-->George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In ''Five Get into a Fix'', old Mrs Jones mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had said to her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with [[Master (form of address)|Master]] instead of [[Miss]]. Various references have been made to what meaning should be read into this \u2013 for instance \"I remember reading in my first Famous Five book about a girl called Master George. What a puzzle and thrill. She claims to never tell lies as that is cowardly.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Hanson |first=Michele |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/25/teachersworkload |title=Everybody gangs up on teachers.

As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In ''Smugger's Top'' it is suggested she is [[claustrophobic]], as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Timmy|Tim|Timothy}}'''\n*:Timmy is George's faithful dog. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes angry when people insult him. In the first book of the series, George's parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five's first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house.\n\n===Close friends===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Alf, the fisherboy}}'''\n*:Alf appears in most of the books set in Kirrin Cottage or at Kirrin Island. In the first book, after George's parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George's boat. In later books Alf only looks after George's boat, as George's parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as JAMES of the same background.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Jo, the ragamuffin girl|Jo|Josephine}}'''\n*:Jo, clever but wild, joins the Five on several adventures near the end of the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the [[circus]], but her mother left and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Joanna/Joan|Joanna|Joan}}'''\n*:Joanna is the housekeeper at George's house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. She is sometimes referred to as Joan.\n\n===Family===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Aunt Fanny|Fanny|Aunt}}'''\n*:Fanny is George's mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton's Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Uncle Quentin|Uncle|Quentin}}'''\n*:Quentin is George's father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children's adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne. \n*'''{{visible anchor|Julian, Dick and Anne's mother| Mother|Annes}}'''\n*:Julian, Dick and Anne's mother is a very nice woman. In Five Go Off In a Caravan, she persuades the children's father to let them go off in a caravan.\n\n==Critical discussion==\n===Floating timeline===\nThe seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a [[floating timeline]]. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. [[J. K. Rowling]] commented of her [[Harry Potter]] series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: \"in book four the hormones are going to kick in \u2013 I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!\"<ref>Carey, Joanna, [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianeducation/story/0,,313220,00.html#article_continue \"Who hasn't met Harry?\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 February 1999</ref>\n\n===Kirrin Issue===\nJulian, Dick and Anne are referred to as the Kirrins on more than one occasion, and once as the Barnads. Accepting them as the Kirrins makes Uncle Quentin (their father's brother) a Kirrin too. But the early books make it clear that Kirrin Island and Kirrin Cottage have been in Aunt Fanny's family for many generations along with much of the land in the area until recent years. And Julian's father says he knows very little about the area and has only visited once many years ago. All of which indicates that Aunt Fanny's maiden name was Kirrin. It's possible of course that coincidence has married one Kirrin to another. But it seems more likely that this is an error on Blyton's part.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" novel series===\n\n#'''[[Five on a Treasure Island]] (1942)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Adventuring Again]] (1943)'''\n#'''[[Five Run Away Together]] (1944)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Smuggler's Top]] (1945)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off in a Caravan]] (1946)'''\n#'''[[Five on Kirrin Island Again]] (1947)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off to Camp]] (1948)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into Trouble]] (1949)'''\n#'''[[Five Fall into Adventure]] (1950)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Hike Together]] (1951)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Wonderful Time]] (1952)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Down to the Sea]] (1953)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Mystery Moor]] (1954)'''\n#'''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]] (1955)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Secret Trail]] (1956)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Billycock Hill]] (1957)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into a Fix]] (1958)'''\n#'''[[Five on Finniston Farm]] (1960)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Demon's Rocks]] (1961)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]] (1962)'''\n#'''[[Five Are Together Again]] (1963)'''\n\nBlyton also wrote a number of short stories featuring the characters, which were collected together in 1995 as ''Five Have a Puzzling Time, and Other Stories''.\n\n===Other book series===\n====Claude Voilier====\nThere are also books written originally in French by [[Claude Voilier]] (the Five have long been extremely popular in translation in the French-speaking parts of Europe) and later translated into English.

A four-disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release.\n\nA seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non-removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012.\n\nA four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as ''Enid Blyton's The Famous Five: The Complete Collection''.\n(The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first  in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.)\n\n====1995 series====\n{{Main|The Famous Five (1995 TV series)}}\nA later series, ''[[The Famous Five (1990s TV series)|The Famous Five]]'', initiated by [[Victor Glynn]] of [[Portman Zenith]] was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including [[Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], Zenith North and the German channel [[ZDF]]. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably [[Jemima Rooper]], who played George. Julian was portrayed by [[Marco Williamson]], Dick by [[Paul Child (actor)|Paul Child]], and Anne  by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.)\n\nThe 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and is marked \"Revised Edition\" to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork. Other episodes have reportedly been released on DVD in Europe,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} but only the adaptation of ''Five on a Treasure Island'' was released on DVD in the UK{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n====''Famous 5: On the Case''====\n{{Main|Famous 5: On the Case}}\nA new Famous Five animated TV series began airing in 2008. ''[[Famous 5: On the Case]]'' is set in modern times and features the children of the original Famous Five: Max (the son of Julian and Brandine), Dylan (son of Dick and Michelle), Jo (daughter of George and Ravi&nbsp;\u2013 a tomboy who, like her mother, prefers a shorter name to her given name Jyoti) and Allie (daughter of Anne and John).<ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_326309\">{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/326309 |title=Famous Five get modern makeover |date=22 March 2008 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref> It has not been stated whether their dog is a descendant of Timmy. The new series was first announced in 2005, and is a co-production of [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] (which currently owns all Famous Five rights) and [[Marathon Media Group|Marathon]], in association with [[France 3]] and [[The Disney Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] confirmed their involvement in December 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article659361.ece |work=The Times |title=Famous Five to get a Disney makeover |first=David |last=Sanderson |date=4 December 2006 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> Stories were developed by [[Tim Maile and Douglas Tuber|Douglas Tuber]] and [[Tim Maile and Douglas Tuber|Tim Maile]], who have previously written for ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''.

All 21 episodes of the original books were dramatised.\n\nThe 21 original stories by Enid Blyton have been released in the 70s as ''F\u00fcnf Freunde'' audio dramas in Germany as well. The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series.\n\nFor the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more \"modern\" action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 80+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and books in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers.\n\n===Theatre===\nA 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton's birth with the title ''The Famous Five'' and later released on DVD as ''The Famous Five \u2013 Smuggler's Gold \u2013 The Musical''.\n<br/>Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, [[Jon Lee (singer)|Jon Lee]], Director: Roz Storey<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000260QVA |title=The Famous Five: The Musical \u2013 Smuggler's Gold DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Famous Five: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\nand also in the five\n\nA brand new musical adaptation was premi\u00e8red at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010.\n\n===Gamebooks===\nTwo sets of [[gamebook]]s in a ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows:\n\n#''The Wreckers' Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea''\n#''The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp''\n#''The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve''\n#''The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together''\n#''The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon's Rocks''\n#''The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill''\n#''The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix''\n#''The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time''\n\nThe second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled \"The Famous Five and You\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=147 |title=The Famous Five and You |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books:\n\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Find Adventure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Run Away!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Take Off!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Underground!''\n\n===Video games===\nIn 1990 an [[interactive fiction]] computer game based on the first of the books, ''Five on a Treasure Island'', was released. It was [[Computer programming|programmed]] by Colin Jordan and first released for the [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] by Enigma Variations.\n\nHe originally started [[Computer programming|coding]] the game on the [[ZX Spectrum]] using his own \"worldscape\" technique. When the SAM Coup\u00e9 was launched, he switched to it as the target platform while still hosting the code on the ZX Spectrum. He later [[porting|ported]] it to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and completed the ZX Spectrum version. The game was also ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by others.\n\nIn the late 1990s, German game publisher [[Ravensburger Interactive]] released 5 adventure games based on the franchise, titled ''Famous Five The Silver Tower'', ''Famous Five Treasure Island'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Kidnapped'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Dangerous Discovery'' and ''Five on a Secret Mission'' for the PC or Mac.\n\n===Comics===\nSix [[comic album]]s drawn by Bernard Dufoss\u00e9 and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title ''Le Club des Cinq''. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by [[Claude Voilier]]. Books were released by [[Hachette Livre]]. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name ''Famous Five''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocomics.info/famous_five.html |title=Euro Comics in English: The Famous Five by Rosenzweig and Dufosse |publisher=Eurocomics.info |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> The titles included \"Famous Five and the Golden Galleon\" (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, \"Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars\", where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and \"Famous Five and the Inca God\" which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish.\n\nBeginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles ''Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine'' were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.\n\n==Parodies==\nThe Five inspired the [[The Comic Strip Presents|Comic Strip]] [[parody]] ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'' and its sequel ''Five Go Mad on Mescalin'', in which the characters express sympathies with [[Nazi Germany]] and opposition to the [[Welfare State]], homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad [[parody]] not so much of Blyton but of wider perceived 1950s [[prejudices]].<ref>Milmo, Cahill [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/back-for-more-jolly-japes-the-return-of-the-famous-five-427139.html \"Back for more jolly japes: the return of the Famous Five\"] ''The Independent'', 5 December 2006</ref> The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five \"era\" (1942\u201363) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states \"We're the Famous Five!\", the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for \"some of your home-made ices\" at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin.\n\nThe series was revived in 2012 with ''Five Go to Rehab'', with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick's birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a \"dyke\" \u2013 an accusation made against George by Toby in the original ''Five Go Mad in Dorset''. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics' sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. ''Five Go to Rehab'' utilises a form of a [[floating timeline]]; although the original films' events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and \"five years after [[World War II|the war]]\", the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming.\n\nParodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, [[John Lennon]] in his work ''[[In His Own Write]]'' had the short story ''The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey''. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists no fewer than ten members of the Five, not counting a dog named Cragesmure. A man warns them off Woenow Abbey and they subdue and question him. The story, like many other stories in this nonsense volume, stops there.\n\n[[Viz (comic)|Viz comic]] has parodied the series' style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions, most notably in its Jack Black strip. In one such strip, Jack Black actually murders a group of young detectives clearly based on The Famous Five so they won't compete with him for a reward.\n\nIn the late eighties, Australian comedy team ''[[The D-Generation]]'' parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled ''The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In''. The parody was based on the first book ''Five on a Treasure Island''.\n\nThe fourth short story in ''[[Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids]]'' by [[Jamie Rix]] is named \"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\", which is about four children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a [[shotgun]]. It was later adapted for the ''[[Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (TV series)|Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids]]'' cartoon, which aired on [[CITV]] in 2000.\n\nA 2005 story in ''[[The Guardian]]'' also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are [[caricature]]s rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, [[Lucy Mangan]], considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.<ref>Mangan, Lucy [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1672558,00.html ''The Famous Five \u2013 in their own words''] The Guardian, 22 December 2005</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 2009, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[The Impressions Show]]'' featured a sketch in which [[Ross Kemp]] meets The Famous Five. It was a parody of his hugely successful [[Sky One]] show, ''Ross Kemp on Gangs''.\n\nBritish comedian [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] did a radio sketch in which Julian and George run into each other as adults and reminisce. It is revealed that Julian has gone on to a career as a smuggler and regularly has to deal with copycat groups of children trying to thwart his plans. George is a happily married mother, Dick has gone to live in a commune in America, and Anne has just been released from prison having murdered a man with a ginger beer bottle.\n\n''[[Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls]]'' features \"The Famous Five Go Pillaging\", \u2013 a short story which parodies the writing style of [[Enid Blyton]]; five children witness the collapse of [[Roman Empire|Roman imperialism]] and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading [[Vikings]].\n\nWebsite [[The Daily Mash]] reported a lost Blyton manuscript titled \"Five Go Deporting Gypsies\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Auction uncovers 'Five Go Deporting'|url=http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/auction-uncovers-five-go-deporting-201102233570|website=The Daily Mash|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA spoof series of five books written by Bruno Vincent was published in November 2016.

Set in 1979, it involves the Five (now middle-aged) reuniting on Kirrin Island, to discuss Julian's plans to develop Kirrin into a theme resort. Julian has become a successful stockbroker, Dick is a well-meaning but inept and overweight policeman, Anne is a worrisome housewife, and George is a feminist community worker (with her flatulent bulldog Gary in tow).

{"title_page": "Chapman\u2013Enskog theory", "text_new": "'''Chapman\u2013Enskog theory''' provides a framework in which equations of [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]] for a gas can be derived from the [[Boltzmann equation]]. The technique justifies the otherwise phenomenological [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] appearing in hydrodynamical descriptions such as the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]].  In doing so, expressions for various transport coefficients such as [[thermal conductivity]] and [[viscosity]] are obtained in terms of molecular parameters. Thus, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory constitutes an important step in the passage from a microscopic, particle-based description to a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] hydrodynamical one.\n\nThe theory is named for [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]], who introduced it independently in 1916 and 1917.<ref name=\"Chapman1970\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Chapman\n| first1 = Sydney\n| last2  = Cowling\n| first2 = T.G.\n| title     = The Mathematical Theory of Non-Uniform Gases\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| edition = 3rd\n| year    = 1970\n}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe starting point of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is the Boltzmann equation for the 1-particle distribution function <math>f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \n\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m} \\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}=\\hat{C} f,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat{C}</math> is a nonlinear integral operator which models the evolution of <math>f</math> under interparticle collisions. This nonlinearity makes solving the full Boltzmann equation difficult, and motivates the development of approximate techniques such as the one provided by Chapman\u2013Enskog theory.\n\nGiven this starting point, the various assumptions underlying the Boltzmann equation carry over to Chapman\u2013Enskog theory as well. The most basic of these requires a separation of scale between the collision duration <math>\\tau_c</math> and the mean free time between collisions <math>\\tau_f</math>: <math>\\tau_c \\ll \\tau_f</math>. This condition ensures that collisions are well-defined events in space and time, and holds if the dimensionless parameter <math>\\gamma \\equiv r_c^3 n</math> is small, where <math>r_c</math> is the range of interparticle interactions and <math>n</math> is the number density.<ref name=\"Balescu1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Balescu\n| first1 = Radu\n| author-link = Radu B\u0103lescu\n| title     = Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics\n| publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-471-04600-4\n}}</ref> In addition to this assumption, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory also requires that <math>\\tau_f</math> is much smaller than any ''extrinsic'' timescales <math>\\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. These are the timescales associated with the terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation, which describe variations of the gas state over macroscopic lengths. Typically, their values are determined by initial/boundary conditions and/or external fields. This separation of scales implies that the collisional term on the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation is much larger than the streaming terms on the left hand side. Thus, an approximate solution can be found from\n\n:<math>\n\\hat{C} f = 0.\n</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the solution to this equation is a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]:\n\n:<math>\nf=n(\\mathbf{r},t)\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right)\n^{3/2}\\exp \\left[ -\\frac{m\\left( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right], \n</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the molecule mass and <math>k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]].<ref name=\"Cercignani1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Cercignani\n| first1 = Carlo\n| title     = Theory and Application of the Boltzmann Equation\n| publisher = Elsevier\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-444-19450-3\n| pages    = 78\u201379\n}}</ref>\nA gas is said to be in ''local equilibrium'' if it satisfies this equation.<ref>Balescu, p. 450</ref> The assumption of local equilibrium leads directly to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], which describe fluids without dissipation, i.e. with thermal conductivity and viscosity equal to <math>0</math>. The primary goal of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to systematically obtain generalizations of the Euler equations which do incorporate dissipation. This is achieved by expressing deviations from local equilibrium as a perturbative series in [[Knudsen number]] <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, which is small if <math>\\tau_f \\ll \\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. Conceptually, the resulting hydrodynamic equations describe the dynamical interplay between free streaming and interparticle collisions. The latter tend to drive the gas ''towards'' local equilibrium, while the former acts across spatial inhomogeneities to drive the gas ''away'' from local equilibrium.<ref>Balescu, p. 451</ref> When the Knudsen number is of the order of 1 or greater, the gas in the system being considered cannot be described as a fluid.\n\nTo first order in <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, one obtains the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. Second and third orders give rise to the [[Burnett equations]] and super-Burnett equations.\n\n==Mathematical formulation==\nSince the Knudsen number does not appear explicitly in the Boltzmann equation, but rather implicitly in terms of the distribution function and boundary conditions, a dummy parameter <math>\\epsilon</math> is introduced to keep track of the appropriate orders in the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\hat{C} f.\n</math>\n\nIt can be seen that small <math>\\epsilon</math> implies the collisional term <math>\\hat{C} f</math> dominates the streaming term <math>\\mathbf{v\\cdot}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}</math>, which is the same as saying the Knudsen number is small. Thus, the appropriate form for the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion is\n\n:<math>\nf=f^{(0)}+\\epsilon f^{(1)}+\\epsilon ^{2}f^{(2)}+\\ldots \\ .\n</math>\n\nSolutions which can be formally expanded in this way are known as ''normal'' solutions to the Boltzmann equation.<ref name=\"Grad1958\">{{Citation\n| last  = Grad\n| first = Harold\n| author-link  = Harold Grad\n| year=1958\n| title = Principles of the Kinetic Theory of Gases \n| editor-last  = Fl\u00fcgge\n| editor-first = S.\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Physics\n| volume = XII\n| pages  = 205\u2013294\n| publisher = Springer-Verlag\n}}</ref> Clearly, this class of solutions excludes non-perturbative contributions (such as <math>e^{-1/\\epsilon}</math>), which appear in boundary layers or near internal [[Shock wave|shock layers]]. Thus, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is restricted to situations in which such solutions are negligible.\n\nSubstituting this expansion and equating orders of <math>\\epsilon</math> leads to the hierarchy\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nJ(f^{(0)},f^{(0)}) &=0 \\\\\n2J(f^{(0)},f^{(n)}) &=\\left(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} \\right) f^{(n-1)}\n-\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}J(f^{(n)},f^{(n-m)}), \\qquad n > 0, \n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>J</math> is an integral operator, linear in both its arguments, which satisfies <math>J(f,g) = J(g,f)</math> and <math>J(f,f) = \\hat{C}f</math>. The solution to the first equation is a Gaussian:\n\n:<math>\nf^{(0)}=n'(\\mathbf{r},t)\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp \\left[ -\\frac{m\\left( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right].  \n</math>\n\nfor some functions <math>n'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, and <math>T'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>.

This surprising result traces back to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who inferred it in 1860 on the basis of more elementary kinetic arguments.<ref> {{Citation\n| last       = Maxwell\n| first      = James\n| author-link  = James Clerk Maxwell\n| year       = 1860\n| title      = V.

For rigid elastic spheres, the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>, while other models typically show greater variation with temperature. For instance, for molecules repelling each other with force <math>\\propto r^{-\\nu}</math> the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^s</math>, where <math>s = 1/2 + 2/(\\nu - 1)</math>. Taking <math>s = 0.668</math>, corresponding to <math>\\nu \\approx 12.9</math>, shows reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed scaling for helium. For more complex gases the agreement is not as good, most likely due to the neglect of attractive forces.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 230-232</ref>  Indeed, the [[Lennard-Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model]], which does incorporate attractions, can be brought into closer agreement with experiment (albeit at the cost of a more opaque <math>T</math> dependence; see the Lennard-Jones entry in table 1).<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 235-237</ref> \n\nChapman\u2013Enskog theory also predicts a simple relation between <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> in the form <math>\\lambda = f \\mu c_v</math>, where <math>c_v</math> is the [[Heat capacity| specific heat]] at constant volume and <math>f</math> is a purely numerical factor. For spherically symmetric molecules, its value is predicted to be very close to <math>2.5</math> in a slightly model-dependent way. For instance, rigid elastic spheres have <math>f \\approx 2.522</math>, and molecules with repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-13}</math> have <math>f \\approx 2.511</math> (the latter deviation is ignored in table 1).

Table 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"ChapmanandCowlingpage249\">Chapman & Cowling p. 249</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\n\nThe basic principles of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory can be extended to more diverse physical models, including gas mixtures and molecules with internal degrees of freedom. In the high-density regime, the theory can be adapted to account for collisional transport of momentum and energy, i.e. transport over a molecular diameter ''during'' a collision, rather than over a mean free path (''in between'' collisions). Including this mechanism predicts a density dependence of the viscosity at high enough density, which is also observed experimentally.\n\nOne can also carry out the theory to higher order in the Knudsen number.

This nonlinearity makes solving the full Boltzmann equation difficult, and motivates the development of approximate techniques such as the one provided by Chapman\u2013Enskog theory.\n\nGiven this starting point, the various assumptions underlying the Boltzmann equation carry over to Chapman\u2013Enskog theory as well. The most basic of these requires a separation of scale between the collision duration <math>\\tau_c</math> and the mean free time between collisions <math>\\tau_f</math>: <math>\\tau_c \\ll \\tau_f</math>. This condition ensures that collisions are well-defined events in space and time, and holds if the dimensionless parameter <math>\\gamma \\equiv r_c^3 n</math> is small, where <math>r_c</math> is the range of interparticle interactions and <math>n</math> is the number density.<ref name=\"Balescu1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Balescu\n| first1 = Radu\n| author-link = Radu B\u0103lescu\n| title     = Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics\n| publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-471-04600-4\n}}</ref> In addition to this assumption, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory also requires that <math>\\tau_f</math> is much smaller than any ''extrinsic'' timescales <math>\\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>.

The primary goal of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to systematically obtain generalizations of the Euler equations which do incorporate dissipation. This is achieved by expressing deviations from local equilibrium as a perturbative series in [[Knudsen number]] <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, which is small if <math>\\tau_f \\ll \\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. Conceptually, the resulting hydrodynamic equations describe the dynamical interplay between free streaming and interparticle collisions.

More precisely, one must show that solutions exist satisfying\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}d\\mathbf{v}= 0 = \\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}\\mathbf{v}^{2}d\\mathbf{v}  \\\\\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}v_{i}d\\mathbf{v} = 0, \\qquad i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nMoreover, even if such solutions exist, there remains the additional question of whether they span the complete set of normal solutions to the Boltzmann equation, i.e. do not represent an artificial restriction of the original expansion in <math>\\epsilon</math>. One of the key technical achievements of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to answer both of these questions in the positive.<ref name=\"Grad1958\"/> Thus, at least at the formal level, there is no loss of generality in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach. \n\nWith these formal considerations established, one can proceed to calculate <math>f^{(1)}</math>.

This surprising result traces back to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who inferred it in 1860 on the basis of more elementary kinetic arguments.<ref> {{Citation\n| last       = Maxwell\n| first      = James\n| author-link  = James Clerk Maxwell\n| year       = 1860\n| title      = V.

For rigid elastic spheres, the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>, while other models typically show greater variation with temperature. For instance, for molecules repelling each other with force <math>\\propto r^{-\\nu}</math> the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^s</math>, where <math>s = 1/2 + 2/(\\nu - 1)</math>. Taking <math>s = 0.668</math>, corresponding to <math>\\nu \\approx 12.9</math>, shows reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed scaling for helium. For more complex gases the agreement is not as good, most likely due to the neglect of attractive forces.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 230-232</ref>  Indeed, the [[Lennard-Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model]], which does incorporate attractions, can be brought into closer agreement with experiment (albeit at the cost of a more opaque <math>T</math> dependence; see the Lennard-Jones entry in table 1).<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 235-237</ref> \n\nChapman\u2013Enskog theory also predicts a simple relation between <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> in the form <math>\\lambda = f \\mu c_v</math>, where <math>c_v</math> is the [[Heat capacity| specific heat]] at constant volume and <math>f</math> is a purely numerical factor. For spherically symmetric molecules, its value is predicted to be very close to <math>2.5</math> in a slightly model-dependent way. For instance, rigid elastic spheres have <math>f \\approx 2.522</math>, and molecules with repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-13}</math> have <math>f \\approx 2.511</math> (the latter deviation is ignored in table 1). The special case of [[Maxwell molecule|Maxwell molecules]] (repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-5}</math>) has <math>f = 2.5</math>  exactly.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 247</ref> Since <math>\\lambda</math>, <math>\\mu</math>, and <math>c_v</math> can be measured directly in experiments, an easy experimental test of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to measure <math>f</math> for the spherically symmetric [[noble gas|noble gases]]. Table 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"ChapmanandCowlingpage249\">Chapman & Cowling p. 249</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\n\nThe basic principles of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory can be extended to more diverse physical models, including gas mixtures and molecules with internal degrees of freedom. In the high-density regime, the theory can be adapted to account for collisional transport of momentum and energy, i.e. transport over a molecular diameter ''during'' a collision, rather than over a mean free path (''in between'' collisions). Including this mechanism predicts a density dependence of the viscosity at high enough density, which is also observed experimentally.\n\nOne can also carry out the theory to higher order in the Knudsen number. In particular, the third-order contribution <math>f^{(2)}</math> has been calculated by Burnett.<ref name=\"Burnett\">{{Citation\n| last       = Burnett\n| first      = D.\n| year       = 1936\n| journal    = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society\n| title      = The Distribution of Molecular Velocities and the Mean Motion in a Non-Uniform Gas\n| volume     = 40\n| page       = 382\n| doi      = 10.1112/plms/s2-40.1.382\n}}</ref> In general circumstances, however, these high-order corrections should be approached with caution, given that the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion may not always converge.<ref name=\"Santos1986\">{{Citation\n| last1       = Santos\n| first1      = Andres\n| last2       = Brey\n| first2      = J.
