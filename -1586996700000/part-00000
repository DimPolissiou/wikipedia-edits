The whole thing hit me in two minutes, and I did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutes.\"  In the ''[[American Masters]]'' episode about his life and career, however, a more defiant Haggard states that the song was more than a satire: \"That's how I got into it with the hippies...I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off.

He is later lured into Enma World (\u30a8\u30f3\u30de\u754c ''Enma-Kai'') by the sound of a ukulele played by Great King Enma.

The furious Great King Enma sends his three adopted oni children, Aobee, Kisuke, and Akane, who are known as the \"Oni Child Trio\" (\u5b50\u9b3c\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa ''Kooni Trio''), to pursue Ojarumaru and get the scepter back.

Fascinated with the prince, Tommy helps Kazuma convince his parents Ai and Makoto into letting Ojarumaru stay with the family, to which they accept. Denbo, Ojarumaru's anthropomorphic firefly caretaker who witnessed the latter falling into the Moon Hole, eventually finds and takes care of him at the request of his parents. While making many new friends and rivals, as well as dodging the Oni Child Trio's efforts to retrieve the scepter, Ojarumaru has many adventures in Moonlight Town and encounters new things he has never seen before in his time period.\n\nLater episodes tend to center around other characters, including: Princess Okame, Ojarumaru's young fianc\u00e9 who desperately tries to win over his heart; Okorinb\u014d and Nikorinb\u014d, two anthropomorphic [[komainu]] who try numerous get-rich-quick methods in a bid to get their [[shinto shrine]] out of poverty; Ken, a [[freeter]] who keeps changing jobs; Kazuma's classmates, big eater Kintar\u014d Sakata, beauty-obsessed Komachi Ono, and the judgmental but well-intentioned Kentar\u014d Iwashimizu; Icchoku Honda, Kazuma's energetic homeroom teacher; the Hoshino Family, 3 aliens from another planet who want to invade earth and have a strange aversion to Ojarumaru; and Sachiyo Usui, an eccentric manga artist who is notorious for her creepy, highly detailed drawings.   \n\nSome episodes place the characters in parodies of notable fairy tales, fables, novels, and TV shows from Japan and other countries. These include [[Momotar\u014d]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 1st series episode 68 \"Ojaru Oni ga Yama e Iku\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b \u9b3c\u304c\u5cf6\u3078\u884c\u304f)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 3rd series episode 5 \"Momoman\" (\u30e2\u30e2\u30de\u30f3)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 7th series episode 86 \"Momoman 2\" (\u30e2\u30e2\u30de\u30f32)</ref>, [[Cinderella]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 2nd series episode 18 \"Ojaderella\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u30c7\u30ec\u30e9)</ref>, [[Ikky\u016b-san]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 13 \"Ojakky\u016b-san\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u4f11\u3055\u3093)</ref>, [[Journey to the West]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 63 \"Ojagoku\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 11th series episode 8 \"Ojagoku Kikiippatsu\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u5371\u6a5f\u4e00\u9aea)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 11th series episode 18 \"Ojagoku Tenjiku no Nazo\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046 \u30c6\u30f3\u30b8\u30af\u306e\u306a\u305e)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 28 \"Nemuccha Dame Dayo Ojagoku\" (\u306d\u3080\u3063\u3061\u3083\u30c0\u30e1\u3060\u3088 \u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 56 \"Ojagoku Ch\u016bmon no \u014ci Sago Shimizu\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u3000\u6ce8\u6587\u306e\u591a\u3044\u30b5\u30b4\u6e05\u6c34)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 68 \"Ojagoku Netemosametemo Chohakkin\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u3000\u5bdd\u3066\u3082\u899a\u3081\u3066\u3082\u30c1\u30e7\u30cf\u30c3\u91d1)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 13th series episode 26 \"Kao ga Kowai yo Ojagoku\" (\u9854\u304c\u3053\u308f\u3044\u3088 \u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 13th series episode 59 \"Kore de Saigo no Ojagoku\" (\u3053\u308c\u3067\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref>, [[Columbo]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 28 \"Keiji Ojarumbo\" (\u5211\u4e8b\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b\u30f3\u30dc)</ref>, [[Peter Pan and Wendy|Peter Pan]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 15th series episode 75 \"Ojater Pan\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u30bf\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3)</ref>, [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 18th series episode 38 \"Ookami Shonen Ojarumaru\" (\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u5c11\u5e74\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b \"Wolf Boy Ojarumaru\")</ref>, [[Attack on Titan]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 21st series episode 21 \"Shingeki no Maro\" (\u9032\u6483\u306e\u30de\u30ed)</ref>, and [[James Bond]].<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 21st series episode 32 \"Makomko 7\" (\u30de\u30b3\u30de\u30b3\uff17)</ref> \n\n==Broadcast==\n6 television specials have aired on NHK E-Tele.

He is later lured into Enma World (\u30a8\u30f3\u30de\u754c ''Enma-Kai'') by the sound of a ukulele played by Great King Enma. Upon arriving, he steals Great King Enma's powerful [[Shaku (ritual baton)|scepter]]{{efn|Officially written in [[katakana]] as \u30b7\u30e3\u30af (''Shaku'')<ref name=\"Story\"/>}}, which he uses in order to judge the dead. While getting chased by Great King Enma, he accidentally falls into the Moon Hole (\u6708\u306e\u7a74 ''Tsuki no Ana''), which time-warps him to modern Japan via the Full Moon Road (\u6e80\u6708\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9 ''Mangetsu R\u014ddo''). The furious Great King Enma sends his three adopted oni children, Aobee, Kisuke, and Akane, who are known as the \"Oni Child Trio\" (\u5b50\u9b3c\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa ''Kooni Trio''), to pursue Ojarumaru and get the scepter back. At the present time, Ojarumaru falls from the moon to the roof of Sakata Apartment (\u5742\u7530\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 ''Sakata Manshon'') where he befriends a boy named Kazuma Tamura and his grandfather Tommy. Fascinated with the prince, Tommy helps Kazuma convince his parents Ai and Makoto into letting Ojarumaru stay with the family, to which they accept. Denbo, Ojarumaru's anthropomorphic firefly caretaker who witnessed the latter falling into the Moon Hole, eventually finds and takes care of him at the request of his parents. While making many new friends and rivals, as well as dodging the Oni Child Trio's efforts to retrieve the scepter, Ojarumaru has many adventures in Moonlight Town and encounters new things he has never seen before in his time period.\n\nLater episodes tend to center around other characters, including: Princess Okame, Ojarumaru's young fianc\u00e9 who desperately tries to win over his heart; Okorinb\u014d and Nikorinb\u014d, two anthropomorphic [[komainu]] who try numerous get-rich-quick methods in a bid to get their [[shinto shrine]] out of poverty; Ken, a [[freeter]] who keeps changing jobs; Kazuma's classmates, big eater Kintar\u014d Sakata, beauty-obsessed Komachi Ono, and the judgmental but well-intentioned Kentar\u014d Iwashimizu; Icchoku Honda, Kazuma's energetic homeroom teacher; the Hoshino Family, 3 aliens from another planet who want to invade earth and have a strange aversion to Ojarumaru; and Sachiyo Usui, an eccentric manga artist who is notorious for her creepy, highly detailed drawings.   \n\nSome episodes place the characters in parodies of notable fairy tales, fables, novels, and TV shows from Japan and other countries. These include [[Momotar\u014d]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 1st series episode 68 \"Ojaru Oni ga Yama e Iku\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b \u9b3c\u304c\u5cf6\u3078\u884c\u304f)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 3rd series episode 5 \"Momoman\" (\u30e2\u30e2\u30de\u30f3)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 7th series episode 86 \"Momoman 2\" (\u30e2\u30e2\u30de\u30f32)</ref>, [[Cinderella]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 2nd series episode 18 \"Ojaderella\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u30c7\u30ec\u30e9)</ref>, [[Ikky\u016b-san]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 13 \"Ojakky\u016b-san\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u4f11\u3055\u3093)</ref>, [[Journey to the West]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 63 \"Ojagoku\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 11th series episode 8 \"Ojagoku Kikiippatsu\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u5371\u6a5f\u4e00\u9aea)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 11th series episode 18 \"Ojagoku Tenjiku no Nazo\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046 \u30c6\u30f3\u30b8\u30af\u306e\u306a\u305e)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 28 \"Nemuccha Dame Dayo Ojagoku\" (\u306d\u3080\u3063\u3061\u3083\u30c0\u30e1\u3060\u3088 \u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 56 \"Ojagoku Ch\u016bmon no \u014ci Sago Shimizu\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u3000\u6ce8\u6587\u306e\u591a\u3044\u30b5\u30b4\u6e05\u6c34)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 12th series episode 68 \"Ojagoku Netemosametemo Chohakkin\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046\u3000\u5bdd\u3066\u3082\u899a\u3081\u3066\u3082\u30c1\u30e7\u30cf\u30c3\u91d1)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 13th series episode 26 \"Kao ga Kowai yo Ojagoku\" (\u9854\u304c\u3053\u308f\u3044\u3088 \u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref><ref>''Ojarumaru'' 13th series episode 59 \"Kore de Saigo no Ojagoku\" (\u3053\u308c\u3067\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u304a\u3058\u3083\u3054\u304f\u3046)</ref>, [[Columbo]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 10th series episode 28 \"Keiji Ojarumbo\" (\u5211\u4e8b\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b\u30f3\u30dc)</ref>, [[Peter Pan and Wendy|Peter Pan]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 15th series episode 75 \"Ojater Pan\" (\u304a\u3058\u3083\u30bf\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3)</ref>, [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 18th series episode 38 \"Ookami Shonen Ojarumaru\" (\u304a\u304a\u304b\u307f\u5c11\u5e74\u304a\u3058\u3083\u308b \"Wolf Boy Ojarumaru\")</ref>, [[Attack on Titan]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 21st series episode 21 \"Shingeki no Maro\" (\u9032\u6483\u306e\u30de\u30ed)</ref>, and [[James Bond]]<ref>''Ojarumaru'' 21st series episode 32 \"Makomko 7\" (\u30de\u30b3\u30de\u30b3\uff17)</ref>. \n\n==Broadcast==\n6 television specials have aired on NHK E-Tele.

Her gift of prophecy was learned from Rhea.<ref name=\"biblio\">[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 3.12.6; on-line English translations of the relevant Classical references are at ''[http://www.theoi.com The Theoi Project]''.</ref> Her father was either the river-gods, [[Cebren]]<ref name=\"biblio\" /><ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Oenone}}</ref> or Oeneus.<ref>[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]], section 159 s.v. Paris and Helen''</ref> Her very name links her to the gift of wine. \n\n== Mythology ==\nParis, son of the king [[Priam]] and the queen [[Hecuba]], fell in love with Oenone when he was a shepherd on the slopes of [[Mount Ida]], having been [[Infanticide|exposed in infancy]] (owing to a prophecy that he would be the means of the destruction of the city of Troy) but rescued by the herdsman [[Agelaus]]. The couple married, and Oenone gave birth to a son, [[Corythus]].\n\nWhen Paris later abandoned her to return to Troy and sail across the Aegean to kidnap Helen, the queen of Sparta, Oenone predicted the [[Trojan War]]. Out of revenge for Paris' betrayal, she sent Corythus to guide the Greeks to Troy. Another version has it that she used her son to drive a rift between Paris and Helen, but Paris, not recognizing his own son, killed him.\n\nThe only extensive surviving narration of Oenone and Paris is [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'', book X.259-489, which tells the return of wounded Paris to Oenone.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=36051&pageno=123 On-line text]</ref> Mortally wounded by [[Philoctetes]]' arrow, he begged Oenone to heal him with her herbal arts,<ref>\"Oenone, skilled in drugs\". according to [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'', 61.</ref> but she refused and cast him out with scorn, to return to Helen's bed, and Paris died on the lower slopes of Ida. Then, overcome with remorse, Oenone, the one whole-hearted mourner of Paris, threw herself onto his burning funeral pyre, which the shepherds had raised. A fragment of [[Bacchylides]] suggests that she threw herself off a cliff,<ref>Bacchylides, fr. 20D</ref> in ''Bibliotheke'' it is noted \"when she found him dead she hanged herself,\" and Lycophron imagined her hurtling head first from the towering walls of Troy. Her tragic story makes one of the ''Love Romances'' of [[Parthenius of Nicaea]].<ref>Parthenius,  4.</ref>\n\n[[Ovid]] includes an imagined reproachful letter from Oenone to Paris in his collection ''[[Heroides]]'',<ref>''Heroides'' v.</ref> a text that has been extended by a number of spurious post-Ovidian interpolations, which include a rape of Oenone by Apollo that is nowhere confirmed in other sources.<ref>Sergio Casali, reviewing ''The Cambridge Heroides'' in ''The Classical Journal'' '''92'''.3 (February 1997, pp. 305-314) pp306-07.</ref>\n\n==In literature==\n[[File:W.E.F. Britten - The Early Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson - Oenone.jpg|thumb|200px|Circa-1901 illustration to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s 1829 poem, \"[[Oenone (poem)|Oenone]]\".]]\n\"Oenone and Paris\" (1594) is an [[Epic poetry|epyllion]] by [[Thomas Heywood]]. [[Lawrence Binyon]] published a one-act [[Closet drama|closet tragedy]] in [[blank verse]] \"Paris and Oenone\" in 1906. [[William Morris]] retold Paris's pleading Oenone to heal him in \"The Death of Paris\" in ''[[The Earthly Paradise]]''.\n\n[[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]] adapted Quintus' treatment of the theme for \"The death of Oenone\" (1892), distilling its tragic essence.<ref>Tennyson dedicated his poem to the classical scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] as \"a Grecian tale retold\" and in his ''Memoirs'' (ii.386) credited it with being \"even more strictly classical in form and language than the old\", as Wilfred P. Mustard noted in ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''23'''.3 (1902), p 318. See [http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/T/TennysonAlfred/verse/deathofoenone/deathoenone.html \"The death of Oenone\"]</ref> This was Tennyson's second attempt at a poem on this subject; his previous, 1829 attempt, \"[[Oenone (poem)|Oenone]]\", was critically panned.<ref>* Thorn, Michael.

Her gift of prophecy was learned from Rhea.<ref name=\"biblio\">[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 3.12.6; on-line English translations of the relevant Classical references are at ''[http://www.theoi.com The Theoi Project]''.</ref> Her father was either the river-gods, [[Cebren]]<ref name=\"biblio\" /><ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Oenone}}</ref> or Oeneus<ref>[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]], section 159 s.v. Paris and Helen''</ref>. Her very name links her to the gift of wine. \n\n== Mythology ==\nParis, son of the king [[Priam]] and the queen [[Hecuba]], fell in love with Oenone when he was a shepherd on the slopes of [[Mount Ida]], having been [[Infanticide|exposed in infancy]] (owing to a prophecy that he would be the means of the destruction of the city of Troy) but rescued by the herdsman [[Agelaus]]. The couple married, and Oenone gave birth to a son, [[Corythus]].\n\nWhen Paris later abandoned her to return to Troy and sail across the Aegean to kidnap Helen, the queen of Sparta, Oenone predicted the [[Trojan War]]. Out of revenge for Paris' betrayal, she sent Corythus to guide the Greeks to Troy. Another version has it that she used her son to drive a rift between Paris and Helen, but Paris, not recognizing his own son, killed him.\n\nThe only extensive surviving narration of Oenone and Paris is [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'', book X.259-489, which tells the return of wounded Paris to Oenone.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=36051&pageno=123 On-line text]</ref> Mortally wounded by [[Philoctetes]]' arrow, he begged Oenone to heal him with her herbal arts,<ref>\"Oenone, skilled in drugs\". according to [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'', 61.</ref> but she refused and cast him out with scorn, to return to Helen's bed, and Paris died on the lower slopes of Ida. Then, overcome with remorse, Oenone, the one whole-hearted mourner of Paris, threw herself onto his burning funeral pyre, which the shepherds had raised. A fragment of [[Bacchylides]] suggests that she threw herself off a cliff,<ref>Bacchylides, fr. 20D</ref> in ''Bibliotheke'' it is noted \"when she found him dead she hanged herself,\" and Lycophron imagined her hurtling head first from the towering walls of Troy. Her tragic story makes one of the ''Love Romances'' of [[Parthenius of Nicaea]].<ref>Parthenius,  4.</ref>\n\n[[Ovid]] includes an imagined reproachful letter from Oenone to Paris in his collection ''[[Heroides]]'',<ref>''Heroides'' v.</ref> a text that has been extended by a number of spurious post-Ovidian interpolations, which include a rape of Oenone by Apollo that is nowhere confirmed in other sources.<ref>Sergio Casali, reviewing ''The Cambridge Heroides'' in ''The Classical Journal'' '''92'''.3 (February 1997, pp. 305-314) pp306-07.</ref>\n\n==In literature==\n[[File:W.E.F. Britten - The Early Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson - Oenone.jpg|thumb|200px|Circa-1901 illustration to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s 1829 poem, \"[[Oenone (poem)|Oenone]]\".]]\n\"Oenone and Paris\" (1594) is an [[Epic poetry|epyllion]] by [[Thomas Heywood]]. [[Lawrence Binyon]] published a one-act [[Closet drama|closet tragedy]] in [[blank verse]] \"Paris and Oenone\" in 1906. [[William Morris]] retold Paris's pleading Oenone to heal him in \"The Death of Paris\" in ''[[The Earthly Paradise]]''.\n\n[[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]] adapted Quintus' treatment of the theme for \"The death of Oenone\" (1892), distilling its tragic essence.<ref>Tennyson dedicated his poem to the classical scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] as \"a Grecian tale retold\" and in his ''Memoirs'' (ii.386) credited it with being \"even more strictly classical in form and language than the old\", as Wilfred P. Mustard noted in ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''23'''.3 (1902), p 318.

{"title_page": "Object composition", "text_new": "{{Short description|Method in computer programming of forming higher-level object types}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}\n{{confused|function composition (computer science)}} \n{{example farm|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], '''object composition''' is a way to combine [[object (computer science)|objects]] or [[data type]]s into more complex ones. Compositions relate to, but are not the same as, data structures, and common ones are the [[tagged union]], [[Set (abstract data type)|set]], [[sequence]], and various [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]] structures, as well as the [[object (computer science)|object]] used in object-oriented programming.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adobe.com/devnet/author_bios/michelle_yaiser.html | title = Object-oriented programming concepts: Composition and aggregation | author = [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/author_bios/michelle_yaiser.html Michelle Yaiser] | publisher = Adobe | quote = Composition is about expressing relationships between objects. Think about the chair example. A chair has a Seat. A chair has a back. And a chair has a set of legs. The phrase \"has a\" implies a relationship where the chair owns, or at minimum, uses, another object. It is this \"has a\" relationship that is the basis for composition. | accessdate = 2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\nObject composition refers to the logical or conceptual structure of the information, not the implementation or physical [[data structure]] used to represent it. For example, a '''sequence''' differs from a '''set''' because (among other things) the order of the composed items matters for the former but not the latter. Data structures such as [[arrays]], [[linked lists]], [[hash tables]], and many others can be used to implement either of them. Perhaps confusingly, some of the same terms are used for both data structures and composites. For example, \"[[binary tree]]\" can refer to either: as a data structure it is a means of accessing a linear sequence of items, and the actual positions of items in the tree are irrelevant (the tree can be internally rearranged however one likes, without changing its meaning). However, as an object composition, the positions are relevant, and changing them would change the meaning (as for example in [[cladogram]]s).\n\n==Details==\nIn programming, types can often be divided into composite and noncomposite types, and composition can be regarded as a relationship between types: an object of a composite type (e.g. ''car'') \"[[has-a|has]]\" objects of other types (e.g. ''wheel''). When a composite object contains several sub-objects of the same type, they may be assigned to particular [[role]]s, often distinguished by names or numbers. For example, a '''Point''' object might contain 3 numbers, each representing distance along a different axis, such as 'x', 'y', and 'z'. The study of part-whole relationships in general, is [[mereology]]. \n\nComposition must be distinguished from [[subtyping]], which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type. For instance, cars may be a specific type of vehicle: ''car'' [[is-a|is a]] ''vehicle''. Subtyping doesn't describe a relationship between different objects, but instead, says that objects of a type are simultaneously objects of another type. The study of such relationships is [[ontology]].\n\nComposite objects may be represented in storage by co-locating the composed items, by co-locating references, or in many other ways. The items within a composite object may be referred to as ''attributes'', ''[[Field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''members'', ''properties'', or other names, and the resulting composition as ''[[composite type]]'', ''[[storage record]]'', ''structure'', ''[[tuple]]'', or a ''user-defined type (UDT)''. For details, see the [[#Aggregation|aggregation]] section below.\n\n==UML notation==\nIn [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], there are two ways of modeling composites: Composition and aggregation. Thus in UML, composition has a more narrow meaning than in ordinary language:\n\nComposition is depicted as a '''filled diamond''' and a solid line.\n\nComposition is a kind of association where the composite object has sole \"''responsibility for the existence and storage of the composed objects''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/|title=UML Specification, page 122|last=|first=|date=|website=www.omg.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong \u201chas a\u201d relationship, as the composite object takes ownership of the component. This means the composite is responsible for the creation and destruction of the component parts. An object may only be part of one composite. If the composite object is destroyed, all the component parts must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object. Composition enforces encapsulation as the component parts usually are members of the composite object.\n\n[[File:AggregationAndComposition.svg|thumb|UML notation for a composition (upper) and an aggregation (lower) (The examples show abstract data models. In the real world a car would not have the responsibility for the existence of the carburetor)]]\nThe more general form, [[Object composition#Aggregation|aggregation]], is depicted as an '''unfilled diamond''' and a solid line.\n\nAggregation is a kind of association that specifies a whole/part relationship between the aggregate (whole) and component part. This relationship between the aggregate and component is a weak \"has-a\" relationship, as the component may outlive the aggregate object. The component object may be accessed through other objects without going through the aggregate object. The aggregate object does not take part in the lifecycle of the component object, meaning the component object may outlive the aggregate object. The state of the component object still forms part of the aggregate object.\n\nA C++ implementation could be something like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Cpp\">\n// Composition:\nclass Car {\n private:\n  // |Car| is the owner of |carburetor_|.  |carburetor_| is created when |Car|\n  // is created, it is destroyed when |Car| is destroyed.\n  Carburetor carburetor_;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Cpp\">\n// Aggregation:\nclass Pond {\n private:\n  // |Pond| is not the owner of |ducks_|, it references |ducks_| managed by\n  // something else.\n  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<Duck>> ducks_;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Composite types in C==\nThis is an example of composition in [[C (programming language)|C]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C\">\nstruct Person\n{\n  int age;\n  char name[20];\n  enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student} employment;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn this example, the primitive (noncomposite) types <tt>int</tt>, <tt>enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student}</tt> and the composite array type  <tt>char[]</tt> are combined to form the composite structure <tt>Person</tt>. Each <tt>Person</tt> structure then \"has an\" age, name, and an employment type.\n\n==Recursive composition==\nObjects can be composed recursively, and are then called [[recursive type]]s. Examples includes various kinds of [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]s, [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]s, and [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]s. Each node in a tree may be a branch or leaf; in other words, each node is a tree at the same time when it belongs to another tree.\n\n==Timeline of composition in various languages==\n[[C (programming language)|C]] calls a record a [[struct (C programming language)|struct]] or structure; [[object-oriented]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Smalltalk]], and [[C++]] often keep their records hidden inside [[Object (computer science)|objects]] ([[Class (computer science)|class]] instances); languages in the [[ML programming language|ML]] family simply call them records.

In composition, when the owning object is destroyed, so are the contained objects. In aggregation, this is not necessarily true. For example, a [[university]] owns various departments (e.g., [[chemistry]]), and each department has a number of professors. If the university closes, the departments will no longer exist, but the professors in those departments will continue to exist. Therefore, a University can be seen as a composition of departments, whereas departments have an aggregation of professors. In addition, a Professor could work in more than one department, but a department could not be part of more than one university.\n\nComposition is usually implemented such that an object contains another object. For example, in [[C++]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass Professor;  // Defined elsewhere\n\nclass Department {\n public:\n  Department(const std::string& title): title_(title) {}\n\n private:\n  // Aggregation: |Professors| may outlive the |Department|.\n  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<Professor>> members_;\n  const std::string title_;\n};\n\n\nclass University {\n public:\n  University() = default;\n\n private:\n  // Composition: |Department|s exist only as long as the faculty exists.\n  std::vector<Department> faculty_ = {\n      Department(\"chemistry\"),\n      Department(\"physics\"),\n      Department(\"arts\"),\n  };\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn aggregation, the object may only contain a reference or pointer to the object (and not have [[object lifetime|lifetime]] responsibility for it).\n\nSometimes aggregation is referred to as composition when the distinction between ordinary composition and aggregation is unimportant.\n\nThe above code would transform into the following UML Class diagram:\n\n[[File:Aggregation-Composition3.png|417px]]\n\n===Aggregation in COM===<!-- This section is linked from [[Aggregation]] -->\n[[File:Simple COM aggregation diagram.svg|thumb|Aggregation in COM]]\nIn Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]], aggregation means that an object exports, as if it were their owner, one or several [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] of another object it owns. Formally, this is more similar to [[Composition (object-oriented programming)|composition]] or [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] than aggregation. However, instead of implementing the exported interfaces by calling the interfaces of the owned object, the interfaces of the owned object themselves are exported. The owned object is responsible for assuring that methods of those interfaces inherited from <tt>[[IUnknown]]</tt> actually invoke the corresponding methods of the owner. This is to guarantee that the reference count of the owner is correct and all interfaces of the owner are accessible through the exported interface, while no other (private) interfaces of the owned object are accessible.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate = 2007-11-04 |publisher = Microsoft | title = Aggregation | work= Platform SDK for Windows XP SP2 |url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686558.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Containment==\n<!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Containment (computer Programming)]] and others link here]] -->\n{{main|Container (abstract data type)}}\nComposition that is used to store several instances of the composited data type is referred to as containment. Examples of such containers are [[Array (data structure)|arrays]], [[associative array]]s, [[binary tree]]s, and [[linked list]]s.\n\nIn [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], containment is depicted with a multiplicity of 1 or 0..''n'' (depending on the issue of ownership), indicating that the data type is composed of an unknown number of instances of the composited data type.\n\n==See also==\n* [[C++ structure]]\n* [[Composite type]]\n* [[Composition over inheritance]]\n* [[Delegation (programming)]]\n* [[Has-a]]\n* [[Implementation inheritance]]\n* [[Inheritance semantics]]\n* [[Law of Demeter]]\n* [[Virtual inheritance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ootips.org/uml-hasa.html Association, Aggregation and Composition], accessed in February 2009\n* Harald St\u00f6rrle, UML2, Addison-Wesley, 2005\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Object Composition}}\n[[Category:Object (computer science)]]\n[[Category:Unified Modeling Language]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Python code]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Method in computer programming of forming higher-level object types}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}\n{{confused|function composition (computer science)}} \n{{example farm|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], '''object composition''' is a way to combine [[object (computer science)|objects]] or [[data type]]s into more complex ones. Compositions relate to, but are not the same as, data structures, and common ones are the [[tagged union]], [[Set (abstract data type)|set]], [[sequence]], and various [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]] structures, as well as the [[object (computer science)|object]] used in object-oriented programming.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adobe.com/devnet/author_bios/michelle_yaiser.html | title = Object-oriented programming concepts: Composition and aggregation | author = [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/author_bios/michelle_yaiser.html Michelle Yaiser] | publisher = Adobe | quote = Composition is about expressing relationships between objects. Think about the chair example. A chair has a Seat. A chair has a back. And a chair has a set of legs. The phrase \"has a\" implies a relationship where the chair owns, or at minimum, uses, another object. It is this \"has a\" relationship that is the basis for composition. | accessdate = 2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\nObject composition refers to the logical or conceptual structure of the information, not the implementation or physical [[data structure]] used to represent it. For example, a '''sequence''' differs from a '''set''' because (among other things) the order of the composed items matters for the former but not the latter. Data structures such as [[arrays]], [[linked lists]], [[hash tables]], and many others can be used to implement either of them. Perhaps confusingly, some of the same terms are used for both data structures and composites. For example, \"[[binary tree]]\" can refer to either: as a data structure it is a means of accessing a linear sequence of items, and the actual positions of items in the tree are irrelevant (the tree can be internally rearranged however one likes, without changing its meaning). However, as an object composition, the positions are relevant, and changing them would change the meaning (as for example in [[cladogram]]s).\n\n==Details==\nIn programming, types can often be divided into composite and noncomposite types, and composition can be regarded as a relationship between types: an object of a composite type (e.g. ''car'') \"[[has-a|has]]\" objects of other types (e.g. ''wheel''). When a composite object contains several sub-objects of the same type, they may be assigned to particular [[role]]s, often distinguished by names or numbers. For example, a '''Point''' object might contain 3 numbers, each representing distance along a different axis, such as 'x', 'y', and 'z'. The study of part-whole relationships in general, is [[mereology]]. \n\nComposition must be distinguished from [[subtyping]], which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type. For instance, cars may be a specific type of vehicle: ''car'' [[is-a|is a]] ''vehicle''. Subtyping doesn't describe a relationship between different objects, but instead, says that objects of a type are simultaneously objects of another type. The study of such relationships is [[ontology]].\n\nComposite objects may be represented in storage by co-locating the composed items, by co-locating references, or in many other ways. The items within a composite object may be referred to as ''attributes'', ''[[Field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''members'', ''properties'', or other names, and the resulting composition as ''[[composite type]]'', ''[[storage record]]'', ''structure'', ''[[tuple]]'', or a ''user-defined type (UDT)''. For details, see the [[#Aggregation|aggregation]] section below.\n\n==UML notation==\nIn [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], there are two ways of modeling composites: Composition and aggregation. Thus in UML, composition has a more narrow meaning than in ordinary language:\n\nComposition is depicted as a '''filled diamond''' and a solid line.\n\nComposition is a kind of association where the composite object has sole \"''responsibility for the existence and storage of the composed objects''\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/|title=UML Specification, page 122|last=|first=|date=|website=www.omg.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>. The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong \u201chas a\u201d relationship, as the composite object takes ownership of the component. This means the composite is responsible for the creation and destruction of the component parts. An object may only be part of one composite. If the composite object is destroyed, all the component parts must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object. Composition enforces encapsulation as the component parts usually are members of the composite object.\n\n[[File:AggregationAndComposition.svg|thumb|UML notation for a composition (upper) and an aggregation (lower) (The examples show abstract data models. In the real world a car would not have the responsibility for the existence of the carburetor)]]\nThe more general form, [[Object composition#Aggregation|aggregation]], is depicted as an '''unfilled diamond''' and a solid line.\n\nAggregation is a kind of association that specifies a whole/part relationship between the aggregate (whole) and component part. This relationship between the aggregate and component is a weak \"has-a\" relationship, as the component may outlive the aggregate object. The component object may be accessed through other objects without going through the aggregate object. The aggregate object does not take part in the lifecycle of the component object, meaning the component object may outlive the aggregate object. The state of the component object still forms part of the aggregate object.\n\nA C++ implementation could be something like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Cpp\">\n// Composition:\nclass Car {\n private:\n  // |Car| is the owner of |carburetor_|.  |carburetor_| is created when |Car|\n  // is created, it is destroyed when |Car| is destroyed.\n  Carburetor carburetor_;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Cpp\">\n// Aggregation:\nclass Pond {\n private:\n  // |Pond| is not the owner of |ducks_|, it references |ducks_| managed by\n  // something else.\n  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<Duck>> ducks_;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Composite types in C==\nThis is an example of composition in [[C (programming language)|C]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C\">\nstruct Person\n{\n  int age;\n  char name[20];\n  enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student} employment;\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn this example, the primitive (noncomposite) types <tt>int</tt>, <tt>enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student}</tt> and the composite array type  <tt>char[]</tt> are combined to form the composite structure <tt>Person</tt>. Each <tt>Person</tt> structure then \"has an\" age, name, and an employment type.\n\n==Recursive composition==\nObjects can be composed recursively, and are then called [[recursive type]]s. Examples includes various kinds of [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]s, [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]s, and [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]s. Each node in a tree may be a branch or leaf; in other words, each node is a tree at the same time when it belongs to another tree.\n\n==Timeline of composition in various languages==\n[[C (programming language)|C]] calls a record a [[struct (C programming language)|struct]] or structure; [[object-oriented]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Smalltalk]], and [[C++]] often keep their records hidden inside [[Object (computer science)|objects]] ([[Class (computer science)|class]] instances); languages in the [[ML programming language|ML]] family simply call them records.

In composition, when the owning object is destroyed, so are the contained objects. In aggregation, this is not necessarily true. For example, a [[university]] owns various departments (e.g., [[chemistry]]), and each department has a number of professors. If the university closes, the departments will no longer exist, but the professors in those departments will continue to exist. Therefore, a University can be seen as a composition of departments, whereas departments have an aggregation of professors. In addition, a Professor could work in more than one department, but a department could not be part of more than one university.\n\nComposition is usually implemented such that an object contains another object. For example, in [[C++]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass Professor;  // Defined elsewhere\n\nclass Department {\n public:\n  Department(const std::string& title): title_(title) {}\n\n private:\n  // Aggregation: |Professors| may outlive the |Department|.\n  std::vector<std::weak_ptr<Professor>> members_;\n  const std::string title_;\n};\n\n\nclass University {\n public:\n  University() = default;\n\n private:\n  // Composition: |Department|s exist only as long as the faculty exists.\n  std::vector<Department> faculty_ = {\n      Department(\"chemistry\"),\n      Department(\"physics\"),\n      Department(\"arts\"),\n  };\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn aggregation, the object may only contain a reference or pointer to the object (and not have [[object lifetime|lifetime]] responsibility for it).\n\nSometimes aggregation is referred to as composition when the distinction between ordinary composition and aggregation is unimportant.\n\nThe above code would transform into the following UML Class diagram:\n\n[[File:Aggregation-Composition3.png|417px]]\n\n===Aggregation in COM===<!-- This section is linked from [[Aggregation]] -->\n[[File:Simple COM aggregation diagram.svg|thumb|Aggregation in COM]]\nIn Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]], aggregation means that an object exports, as if it were their owner, one or several [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] of another object it owns.

The film is a feature-length version of the [[Code 8 (2016 film)|2016 short film of the same name]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the public becomes aware of people with superhuman abilities known as Powers, causing the government to pass a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. They quickly become a key component of the economy, notably when constructing Lincoln City as the \"City of Tomorrow\". As the Second Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized in the face of increasing mechanization, leading to severe prejudice as they become second-class citizens. By the 1990s, a crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of desperate or trafficked Powers. Police departments begin using advanced drones, armed androids named Guardians and ever-present facial recognition software to combat Power-related crime while a city-wide Powers ban is debated.\n\nConnor Reed is a 26-year-old Class 5 Electric (electrokinetic). His mother, a Cryo (cryokinetic), has brain cancer which causes her abilities to sometimes act erratically. As Powers, they cannot afford the treatment she needs. Connor's father was also an Electric who died when he was young trying to rob a convenience store. As such, his mother has raised him never to use his abilities in front of normal people. Connor makes ends meet by working as an unregistered day laborer alongside many other Powers, using his abilities to install electrical wiring without protection. While on a job, the police arrive and order the workers to disband and a Pyro (pyrokinetic) is killed when attempting to flee arrest. Elsewhere in the city, a drug raid is conducted by detectives Park and Davis on an apartment complex owned by crime lord Marcus Sutcliffe, the local agent of The Trust and a Reader (telepath). Almost $1 million worth of product is seized, putting Sutcliffe in conflict with Wesley Cumbo, his superior in The Trust who demands their expected cut in a week's time. Reed is approached by Garrett, Sutcliffe's underling and a TK (telekinetic), and his crew for a job. Despite warnings from a fellow worker, Reed goes with them and participates in a chemical theft, shorting out the electric fence in an amazing show of power. Reed is introduced to Sutcliffe and meets Nia, Sutcliffe's supposed girlfriend. Park and Davis arrive on the scene the next day and determine that Sutcliffe is using the chemicals that were stolen to cut his remaining product, indicating he is desperate for revenue. \n\nGarrett recruits Reed, recognizing he has untapped potential, and agrees to help him earn enough money to get his mother treatment. He begins training Reed on how to use his abilities and uses him as an enforcer in the Psyke trade, while also grooming him to be more assertive, believing that normal people will always be afraid of Powers and they deserve to take what they want. Reed also grows close with the members of Garrett's crew, including Freddie, a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy, Garrett's girlfriend and a Pyro. Sutcliffe has the crew rob a bank in order to pay back The Trust, but the vault only contains $50,000, since the vault was emptied for the weekend earlier that day. Cumbo's Shifter (shapeshifter) assassin Copperhead attempts to kill Sutcliffe for not honoring his debt, but Sutcliffe's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, manages to kill them. Reed is injured in the scuffle and Nia reveals that she is a Healer, and only remains with Sutcliffe to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction in order to pay a debt. \n\nReed's mother confronts him about the stash of money he has been making working with the crew, chastising him for following in the footsteps of his father. She suddenly convulses and Reed rushes her to the hospital, where the doctor tells him they will need to operate soon to remove her tumor. Park and Davis bring Reed in for questioning, encouraging him to cooperate as they have already confiscated much of the Psyke on the street, weakening Sutcliffe's influence. Davis advises they plant evidence in order to coerce Reed into informing, while Park is adamant that they cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Reed is released and goes to Garrett to suggest they raid the scheduled Psyke Run, the monthly transport of seized product for destruction, which will be worth approximately $10 million. Garrett and Reed bring the idea to Sutcliffe, where Reed demands Nia heal his mother as payment and Garrett stipulates he will be a partner again in running the Psyke trade.\n \nOn the day of the heist, the crew blocks the truck while it is inside a no-fly-zone, preventing back-up by drones that carry Guardians. Reed shorts out the truck's electronics and they manage to destroy the Guardians. As Maddy hands off the Psyke to Rhino, Sutcliffe's men execute the officers protecting the truck and turn on the crew, killing Maddy and mortally wounding Freddie before he, Garrett and Reed manage to escape. Rhino flees with the drugs while the drone pilot disregards the no-fly-zone and drops additional Guardians into the area, killing the rest of Sutcliffe's men. Freddie dies as Reed and Garrett drive away. Reed tells Garrett that Sutcliffe betrayed them because of Garrett's demands, and they part ways. Davis and Park's captain is furious that Reed was not arrested before the heist, and demands they bring in those responsible. Park visits his daughter, a TK Power, who is afraid she will be given away because she is struggling to control her abilities. Reed contacts Park and offers up Sutcliffe's hideout. The cops raid Suttcliffe's hideout while Reed and Garrett seek revenge at his escape route. After killing Rhino and Sutcliffe, Garrett takes the Psyke for himself and encourages Reed to force Nia to heal his mother. Nia pleads with Reed to let her go, as her abilities do not just heal people, but force her to take the injury or disease onto herself, meaning she can die if she attempts to heal his mother. Reed takes Nia to the hospital at gunpoint, but finally tells her to stop after he sees how painful the process is for her. Reed shares a tearful goodbye with his mother before she dies. \n\nReed drives to the police station and gives Nia his truck in order to leave the city. He decides to turn himself in to try and make up for his mistakes. Garrett hands over the Psyke to Cumbo and takes over the drug trade for The Trust in Lincoln City. Reed visits his mother's grave before he serves his sentence, while Nia has a tearful visit with her father in prison, whose debt she was paying off with Sutcliffe. Meanwhile, the Powers Ban is being voted on due to the heist while Park reluctantly accepts an award for the raid against Sutcliffe.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Connor Reed\n* [[Stephen Amell]] as Garrett Kelton\n* [[Sung Kang]] as Park\n* [[Kari Matchett]] as Mary Reed\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Marcus Suttcliffe\n* [[Alex Mallari Jr.]] as Rainer\n* [[Aaron Abrams]] as Davis\n* Kyla Kane as Nia\n* [[Laysla De Oliveira]] as Maddy\n* Vlad Alexis as Freddie\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Wesley Cumbo\n* [[Shaun Benson]] as Dixon\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2016, Robbie and Stephen Amell released a short film, ''[[Code 8 (2016 film)|Code 8]]'', which acted as a teaser for a potential feature film.

For example, [[unison|1/1]], [[major third|5/4]], and [[perfect fifth|3/2]] ([[Just intonation|just]] [[major chord]]) form an otonality because they can be written as 4/4, 5/4, 6/4. This in turn can be written as an extended ratio 4:5:6. Every otonality is therefore composed of members of a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. Similarly, the ratios of a utonality share the same numerator. [[Septimal minor seventh|7/4]], [[septimal tritone|7/5]], [[septimal minor third|7/6]], and 1/1 (7/7) form a utonality, sometimes written as 1/(4:5:6:7), or as 7/(7:6:5:4).

Da Capo Press, 1974. {{ISBN|0-306-80106-X}}.</ref>\n\nIf otonality and utonality are defined broadly, every just intonation chord is both an otonality and a utonality. For example, the minor triad in root position is made up of the 10th, 12th and 15th harmonics, and 10/10, 12/10 and 15/10 meets the definition of otonal. A better, narrower definition requires that the harmonic (or subharmonic) series members be adjacent. Thus 4:5:6 is an otonality, but 10:12:15 is not. (Alternate voicings of 4:5:6, such as 5:6:8, 3:4:5:6, etc. would presumably also be otonalities.) Under this definition, only a few chord types qualify as otonalities or utonalities. The only otonality triads are the major triad 4:5:6 and the diminished triad 5:6:7. The only such tetrad is the dom7 tetrad 4:5:6:7.\n\nMicrotonalists have extended the concept of otonal and utonal to apply to all just intonation chords. A chord is otonal if its [[Limit_(music)#Odd_limit|odd limit]] increases on being [[Inversion_(music)#Melodies|melodically inverted]], utonal if its odd limit decreases, and ambitonal if its odd limit is unchanged.<ref>\"[http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Otonality+and+utonality Otonality and utonality]\", ''Xenharmonic.wikispaces.com''. Opens with: \"For the basic concepts, see the Wikipedia article Otonality and Utonality.\" Accessed: December 18, 2017.</ref> Melodic inversion is not inversion in the usual sense, in which C E G becomes E G C or G C E. Instead, C E G is turned upside down to become C A{{Music|b}} F. A chord's odd limit is the largest of the odd limits of each of the numbers in the chord's extended ratio. For example, the major triad in close position is 4:5:6. These three numbers have odd limits of 1, 5 and 3 respectively. The largest of the three is 5, thus the chord has an odd limit of 5. Its melodic inverse 10:12:15 has an odd limit of 15, which is greater, therefore the major triad is otonal. A chord's odd limit is independent of its voicing, so alternate voicings such as 5:6:8, 3:4:5:6, etc. are also otonal.\n\nAll otonalities are otonal, but not all otonal chords are otonalities. Likewise, all utonalities are a subset of utonal chords.\n\nThe major 9th chord 8:10:12:15:18 is also otonal. Examples of ambitonal chords are the maj6 chord (12:15:18:20) and the maj7 chord (8:10:12:15). Ambitonal chords often can be reasonably interpreted as either major or minor. For example, Cmaj6, in certain contexts or voicings, can be interpreted as Amin7.\n\n== Relationship to standard Western music theory ==\n{{Main|Harmonic dualism}}\nPartch said that his 1931 coinage of \"otonality\" and \"utonality\" was \"hastened\" by having read [[Henry Cowell]]'s discussion of undertones in ''New Musical Resources'' (1930).<ref name=\"Gilmore\"/>\n\nThe 5-[[limit (music)|limit]] otonality is simply a just major chord, and the 5-limit utonality is a just [[minor chord]]. Thus otonality and utonality can be viewed as extensions of major and minor tonality respectively. However, whereas standard music theory views a minor chord as being built up from the root with a [[minor third]] and a [[perfect fifth]], a utonality is viewed as descending from what's normally considered the \"fifth\" of the chord,{{fact|date=October 2013}} so the correspondence is not perfect. This corresponds with the dualistic theory of [[Hugo Riemann]]:\n[[Image:Minor as upside down major.png|thumb|center|400px|Minor as upside down major.]]\n\nIn the era of [[meantone temperament]], [[augmented sixth chord]]s of the kind known as the German sixth (or the English sixth, depending on how it resolves) were close in tuning and sound to the [[7-limit]] otonality, called the [[tetrad (music)|tetrad]]. This chord might be, for example, A{{music|b}}-C-E{{music|b}}-G{{music|7}}{{music|b}}[F{{music|#}}] {{audio|Just German sixth on Ab.mid|Play}}. Standing alone, it has something of the sound of a dominant seventh, but considerably less dissonant. It has also been suggested that the [[Tristan chord]], for example, F-B-D{{music|#}}-G{{music|#}} can be considered a utonality, or 7-limit utonal tetrad, which it closely approximates if the tuning is meantone, though presumably less well in the tuning of a Wagnerian orchestra.\n\nWhereas [[Five-limit tuning|5-limit]] chords associate otonal with major and utonal with minor, [[7-limit tuning|7-limit]] chords that don't use 5 as a prime factor reverse this association. For example, 6:7:9 is otonal but minor, and 14:18:21 is utonal but major.\n\n== Consonance ==\n{{Uncited-section|date=October 2013}}\nThough Partch presents otonality and utonality as being equal and symmetric concepts, when played on most physical instruments an otonality sounds much more [[consonance and dissonance|consonant]] than a similar utonality, due to the presence of the [[missing fundamental|missing fundamental phenomenon]]. In an otonality, all of the notes are elements of the same [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]], so they tend to partially activate the presence of a \"virtual\" fundamental as though they were harmonics of a single complex pitch. Utonal chords, while containing the same dyads and roughness as otonal chords, do not tend to activate this phenomenon as strongly.
